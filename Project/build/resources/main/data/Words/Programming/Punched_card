terms ibm card hollerith card specifically refer punched cards used semiautomatic data processing punched cards were widely used through much 20th century what became known data processing industry where specialized increasingly complex unit record machines organized into data processing systems used punched cards for data input output storage many early digital computers used punched cards often prepared using keypunch machines primary medium for input both computer programs data while punched cards are now obsolete recording medium some voting machines still use punched cards record

by his assistant jean-baptiste falcon jacques vaucanson although these improvements controlled patterns woven they still required assistant operate mechanism joseph marie jacquard demonstrated mechanism automate loom operation number punched cards were linked into chain any length each card held instructions for shedding raising lowering warp selecting shuttle for single pass considered important step history computing hardware semen korsakov's punched card semen korsakov was reputedly first use punched cards informatics for information store search korsakov announced his new method machines september rather than seeking patents he offered machines for public use charles babbage proposed use number cards pierced with certain holes stand opposite levers connected with set figure wheels advanced they push those levers opposite which there are no holes on card thus transfer that number his description calculating engine's store herman hollerith invented recording data on medium that could then be read by machine prior uses machine readable media such those above other than korsakov had been for control not data after some initial trials with paper tape he settled on punched cards developing punched card data processing technology for us census hollerith founded tabulating machine company which was one four companies that were consolidated form computing-tabulating-recording company ctr later renamed international business machines corporation ibm ibm manufactured marketed variety unit record machines for creating sorting tabulating punched cards even after expanding into electronic computers late 1950s ibm developed punched card technology into powerful tool for business data-processing produced extensive line general purpose unit record machines by ibm card ibm unit record machines had become ubiquitous industry government do not fold spindle mutilate generalized version warning that appeared on some punched cards generally on those distributed paper documents be later returned for further machine processing checks for example became motto for post-world war ii era from 1900s into 1950s punched cards were primary medium for data entry data storage processing institutional computing according ibm archives by ibm had presses at work endicott ny printing cutting stacking five million punched cards every day punched cards were even used legal documents such us government checks savings bonds unityper introduced magnetic tape for data entry 1950s during 1960s punched card was gradually replaced primary means for data storage by magnetic tape better more capable computers became available mohawk data sciences introduced magnetic tape encoder system marketed keypunch replacement which was somewhat successful but punched cards were still commonly used for data entry programming until mid-1980s when combination lower cost magnetic disk storage affordable interactive terminals on less expensive minicomputers made punched cards obsolete for this role well however their influence lives on through many standard conventions file formats terminals that replaced punched cards ibm for example displayed columns text text mode for compatibility with existing software some programs still operate on convention text columns although fewer fewer do newer systems employ graphical user interfaces with variable-width type fonts nomenclature terms punched card punch card punchcard were all commonly used were ibm card hollerith card after herman hollerith ibm used ibm card later punched card at first mention its documentation thereafter simply card cards specific formats were often indicated by number character positions available eg 80-column card sequence cards that input output from some step application's processing called card deck simply deck rectangular round oval bits paper punched out were called chad chads chips ibm usage adjacent card columns allocated for specific use such names addresses multi-digit numbers etc are known field card formats hollerith punched cards used for us census were blank following that cards commonly had printing such that row column position hole could be easily seen printing could include having fields named marked by vertical lines logos more general purpose layouts see for example ibm below were also available some cards had one upper corner cut so that cards not oriented correctly cards with different corner cuts could be identified hollerith's punched card formats hollerith card shown railroad gazette herman hollerith was awarded series patents for electromechanical tabulating machines these patents described both paper tape rectangular cards possible recording media card shown us patent june was printed with template had hole positions arranged close edges so they could be reached by railroad conductor's ticket punch with center reserved for written descriptions hollerith was originally inspired by railroad tickets that let conductor encode rough description passenger i was traveling west i had ticket with what i think was called punch photographthe conductorpunched out description individual light hair dark eyes large nose etc so you see i only made punch photograph each person use ticket punch proved tiring error prone so hollerith invented pantograph keyboard punch featured enlarged diagram card indicating positions holes be punched printed reading board could be placed under card that was be read manually hollerith envisioned number card sizes article he wrote describing his proposed system for tabulating us census hollerith suggested card inches by 5½ inches manila stock would be sufficient answer all ordinary purposes cards used census had round holes rows columns reading board for these cards can be seen at columbia university computing history site at some point 1⁄4 by 3⁄8 inches by mm became standard card size these are identical dimensions then current paper currency 1862-1923 some surmise that readily available storage devices for paper currency were commonsensically coopted be used for first storage hollerith cards hollerith's original system used ad-hoc coding system for each application with groups holes assigned specific meanings eg sex marital status his tabulating machine had up counters each with dial divided into divisions with two indicator hands one which stepped one unit with each counting pulse other which advanced one unit every time other dial made complete revolution this arrangement allowed count up during given tabulating run each counter was typically assigned specific hole hollerith also used relay logic allow counts combination holes eg count married females later designs standardized coding these cards had ten rows each row assigned digit value through columns this provided for field adjacent columns represent multi-digit numbers that tabulators could sum instead their simply counting cards hollerith's column punched cards are illustrated comrie's application hollerith tabulating machine brown's tables moon ibm 80-column punched card formats character codes general-purpose punched card from mid twentieth century card from fortran program z1 = y + w1 this ibm card format designed has rectangular holes columns with punch locations each one character each column card size exactly  7 3⁄8 by  3 1⁄4 inches mm × mm cards are made smooth stock inches µm thick there are about cards inch 56/cm ibm changed from square round corners they come typically boxes cards continuous form cards continuous form cards could be both pre-numbered pre-punched for document control checks for example lower ten positions represented from top bottom digits through top two positions column were called zone punches top originally only numeric information was punched with punch per column indicating digit signs could be added field by overpunching least significant digit with zone punch for plus for minus zone punches had other uses processing well such indicating master record /&-0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqr/stuvwxyz y / x xxxxxxxxx x| x xxxxxxxxx 0| x xxxxxxxxx 1| x x x x 2| x x x x 3| x x x x 4| x x x x 5| x x x x 6| x x x x 7| x x x x 8| x x x x 9| x x x x | 　reference note x y zones were also called zones respectively ibm began introducing multiple punches for upper-case letters special characters letter has two punches zone + digit most special characters have two three punches zone + digit + few special characters were exceptions ebcdic & only - only / + with these changes information represented column by combination zones digits dependent on use that column for example combination 12-1 letter alphabetic column plus signed digit signed numeric column unsigned digit column where have some other use introduction ebcdic allowed columns with many six punches zones + digit ibm other manufacturers used many different 80-column card character encodings american national standard defined punches for characters was named hollerith punched card code often referred simply hollerith card code honoring hollerith binary punched card for some computer applications binary formats were used where each hole represented single binary digit bit every column row treated simple bitfield every combination holes permitted for example ibm card reader used with 704/709/7090/7094 series scientific computers treated every row two 36-bit words ignoring columns specific columns used were selectable using plugboard control panel which almost always wired select columns 1–72 sometimes ignored columns usually 73–80 were used contain sequence number for each card so card deck could be sorted correct order case was dropped alternative format used by ibm 704's ibm native card reader referred column binary chinese binary used columns for each 36-bit word later computers such ibm system/360 used every column ibm 1401's card reader could be used column binary mode which stored two characters every column one 36-bit word three columns when used input device for other computers however most older card punches were not intended punch more than holes column so they could not be used produce binary cards invalid lace cards such these pose mechanical problems for card readers prank binary mode cards could be punched where every possible punch position had hole such lace cards lacked structural strength would frequently buckle jam inside machine 80-column card format dominated industry becoming known just ibm cards even though other companies made cards equipment process them card from non-ibm manufacturer one most common printed punched cards ibm card format general purpose layout with no field divisions this format has digits printed on corresponding punch positions digits each columns other card vendors manufactured cards with this same layout number ibm stub cards short cards 80-column card could be scored on either end creating stub that could be torn off leaving stub card short card common length for stub cards was 51-columns stub cards were used applications requiring tags labels carbon copies ibm port-a-punch ibm port-a-punch fortran port-a-punch card compiler directive squeeze removed alternating blank columns from input ibm column punched card according ibm archive ibm's supplies division introduced port-a-punch fast accurate means manually punching holes specially scored ibm punched cards designed fit pocket port-a-punch made possible create punched card documents anywhere product was intended for on-the-spot recording operations—such physical inventories job tickets statistical surveys—because eliminated need for preliminary writing typing source documents ibm 96-column punched card format early 1970s ibm introduced new smaller round-hole 96-column card format along with ibm system/3 computer these cards have tiny mm circular holes smaller than those paper tape data stored six-bit binary-coded decimal code with three rows characters each 8-bit ebcdic this format each column top tiers are combined with two punch rows from bottom tier form 8-bit byte middle tier combined with two more punch rows so that each card contains bytes 8-bit-per-byte binary coded data powers/remington rand univac card formats blank remington rand univac format card card courtesy mit museum punched remington rand card with ibm card for comparison powers/remington rand card format was initially same hollerith's columns round holes remington rand leap-frogged ibm's column format from by coding two characters each columns – producing what now commonly called 90-column card there are two sets six rows across each card rows each set are labeled 1/2 3/4 5/6 7/8 even numbers pair are formed by combining that punch with punch alphabetic special characters use more punches powers-samas card formats powers-samas card formats began with columns round holes later column cards were provided column card was also available - formed by dividing card into two rows each row with columns each character space with punch positions column card was comparable ibm stub card mark sense cards hp educational basic optical mark-reader card mark sense electrographic cards developed by reynold b johnson at ibm have printed ovals that could be marked with special electrographic pencil cards would typically be punched with some initial information such name location inventory item information be added such quantity item on hand would be marked ovals card punches with option detect mark sense cards could then punch corresponding information into card aperture cards aperture card aperture cards have cut-out hole on right side punched card mm microfilm chip containing microform image mounted hole aperture cards are used for engineering drawings from all engineering disciplines information about drawing for example drawing number typically punched printed on remainder card ibm punched card manufacturing ibm's fred m carroll developed series rotary type presses that were used produce well-known standard tabulating cards including model that operated at cards per minute cpm later he developed completely different press capable operating at speeds excess cpm was introduced carroll's high-speed press containing printing cylinder revolutionized manufacture punched tabulating cards estimated that between carroll press accounted for much percent company's profits institutions such universities often had their general purpose cards printed with logo wide variety forms documents were printed on punched cards including checks such printing did not interfere with operation machinery punched card printing plate discarded printing plates from these card presses each printing plate size ibm card formed into cylinder often found use desk pen/pencil holders even today are collectible ibm artifacts every card layout had its own printing plate ibm initially required that its customers use only ibm manufactured cards with ibm machines which were leased not sold ibm viewed its business providing service that cards were part machine us government took ibm court on this issue ibm fought all way supreme court lost court ruling that ibm could only set card specifications another case heard ibm signed consent decree requiring amongst other things that ibm would by have no more than one-half punched card manufacturing capacity united
