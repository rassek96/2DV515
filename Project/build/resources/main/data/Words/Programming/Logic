logical form central logic validity argument determined by its logical form not by its content traditional aristotelian syllogistic logic modern symbolic logic are examples formal logic informal logic study natural language arguments study fallacies important branch informal logic since much informal argument not strictly speaking deductive on many conceptions logic informal logic not logic at all see 'rival conceptions logic' below formal logic study inference with purely formal content inference possesses purely formal content if can be expressed particular application wholly abstract rule that rule that not about any particular thing property works aristotle contain earliest known formal study logic modern formal logic follows expands on aristotle many definitions logic logical inference inference with purely formal content are same this does not render notion informal logic vacuous because no formal logic captures all nuances natural language symbolic logic study symbolic abstractions that capture formal features logical inference symbolic logic often divided into two main branches propositional logic predicate logic mathematical logic extension symbolic logic into other areas particular study model theory proof theory set theory recursion theory however agreement on what logic has remained elusive although field universal logic has studied common structure logics mossakowski et al commented that embarrassing that there no widely acceptable formal definition 'a logic' logical form main article logical form logic generally considered formal when analyzes represents form any valid argument type form argument displayed by representing its sentences formal grammar symbolism logical language make its content usable formal inference simply put formalising simply means translating english sentences into language logic this called showing logical form argument necessary because indicative sentences ordinary language show considerable variety form complexity that makes their use inference impractical requires first ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant logic such gender declension if argument latin replacing conjunctions irrelevant logic such but with logical conjunctions like replacing ambiguous alternative logical expressions any every etc with expressions standard type such all universal quantifier ∀ second certain parts sentence must be replaced with schematic letters thus for example expression all are bs shows logical form common sentences all men are mortals all cats are carnivores all greeks are philosophers so on importance form was recognised from ancient times aristotle uses variable letters represent valid inferences prior analytics leading jan łukasiewicz say that introduction variables was one aristotle's greatest inventions according followers aristotle such ammonius only logical principles stated schematic terms belong logic not those given concrete terms concrete terms man mortal etc are analogous substitution values schematic placeholders b c which were called matter greek hyle inference fundamental difference between modern formal logic traditional aristotelian logic lies their differing analysis logical form sentences they treat traditional view form sentence consists subject eg man plus sign quantity all some no copula which form not predicate eg mortal thus 'all men are mortal' logical constants such all no so on plus sentential connectives such were called syncategorematic terms from greek kategorei – predicate syn – together with this fixed scheme where each judgment has specific quantity copula determining logical form sentence modern view more complex since single judgement aristotle's system involves two more logical connectives for example sentence all men are mortal involves term logic two non-logical terms man here m mortal here d sentence given by judgement amd predicate logic sentence involves same two non-logical concepts here analyzed m x {\displaystyle mx} d x {\displaystyle dx} sentence given by ∀ x m x → d x {\displaystyle \forall xmx\rightarrow dx} involving logical connectives for universal quantification implication more complex modern view comes with more power on modern view fundamental form simple sentence given by recursive schema like natural language involving logical connectives which are joined by juxtaposition other sentences which turn may have logical structure medieval logicians recognized problem multiple generality where aristotelian logic unable satisfactorily render such sentences some guys have all luck because both quantities all some may be relevant inference but fixed scheme that aristotle used allows only one govern inference just linguists recognize recursive structure natural languages appears that logic needs recursive structure semantics main article semantics logic validity argument depends upon meaning semantics sentences that make up aristotle's organon especially on interpretation gives cursory outline semantics which scholastic logicians particularly thirteenth fourteenth century developed into complex sophisticated theory called supposition theory this showed how truth simple sentences expressed schematically depend on how terms 'supposit' stand for certain extra-linguistic items for example book ii his summa logicae william ockham presents comprehensive account necessary sufficient conditions for truth simple sentences order show which arguments are valid which are not thus 'every b' true if only if there something for which 'a' stands for there nothing for which 'a' stands for which 'b' does not also stand for early modern logic defined semantics purely relation between ideas antoine arnauld port royal logic says that 'after conceiving things by our ideas we compare these ideas finding that some belong together some do not we unite separate them this called affirming denying general judging' thus truth falsity are no more than agreement disagreement ideas this suggests obvious difficulties leading locke distinguish between 'real' truth when our ideas have 'real existence' 'imaginary' 'verbal' truth where ideas like harpies centaurs exist only mind this view psychologism was taken extreme nineteenth century generally held by modern logicians signify low point decline logic before twentieth century modern semantics some ways closer medieval view rejecting such psychological truth-conditions however introduction quantification needed solve problem multiple generality rendered impossible kind subject-predicate analysis that underlies medieval semantics main modern approach model-theoretic semantics based on alfred tarski's semantic theory truth approach assumes that meaning various parts propositions are given by possible ways we can give recursively specified group interpretation functions from them some predefined mathematical domains interpretation first-order predicate logic given by mapping from terms universe individuals mapping from propositions truth values true false model-theoretic semantics one fundamental concepts model theory modern semantics also admits rival approaches such proof-theoretic semantics that associates meaning propositions with roles that they can play inferences approach that ultimately derives from work gerhard gentzen on structural proof theory heavily influenced by ludwig wittgenstein's later philosophy especially his aphorism meaning use inference inference not be confused with implication implication sentence form 'if p then q' can be true false stoic logician philo megara was first define truth conditions such implication false only when antecedent p true consequent q false all other cases true inference on other hand consists two separately asserted propositions form 'p therefore q' inference not true false but valid invalid however there connection between implication inference follows if implication 'if p then q' true inference 'p therefore q' valid this was given apparently paradoxical formulation by philo who said that implication 'if day night' true only at night so inference 'it day therefore night' valid night but not day theory inference 'consequences' was systematically developed medieval times by logicians such william ockham walter burley uniquely medieval though has its origins aristotle's topics boethius' de syllogismis hypotheticis this why many terms logic are latin for example rule that licenses move from implication 'if p then q' plus assertion its antecedent p assertion consequent q known modus ponens 'mode positing' its latin formulation 'posito antecedente ponitur consequens' latin formulations many other rules such 'ex falso quodlibet' anything follows from falsehood 'reductio ad absurdum' disproof by showing consequence absurd also date from this period however theory consequences so-called 'hypothetical syllogism' was never fully integrated into theory 'categorical syllogism' this was partly because resistance reducing categorical judgment 'every s p' so-called hypothetical judgment 'if anything s p' first was thought imply 'some s p' second was not late encyclopedia britannica article on logic we find oxford logician th case arguing against sigwart's brentano's modern analysis universal proposition cf problem existential import logical systems main article formal system formal system organisation terms used for analysis deduction consists alphabet language over alphabet construct sentences rule for deriving sentences among important properties that logical systems can have are consistency which means that no theorem system contradicts another validity which means that system's rules proof never allow false inference from true premises completeness which means that if formula true can be proven ie theorem system soundness meaning that if any formula theorem system true this converse completeness note that distinct philosophical use term argument sound when both valid its premises are true some logical systems do not have all four properties example kurt gödel's incompleteness theorems show that sufficiently complex formal systems arithmetic cannot be consistent complete however first-order predicate logics not extended by specific axioms be arithmetic formal systems with equality can be complete consistent logic rationality main article logic rationality this article may be confusing unclear readers please help us clarify article suggestions may be found on talk page may learn how when remove this template message study argument clear importance reasons that we hold things be true logic essential importance rationality here we have defined logic be systematic study form arguments reasoning behind argument several sorts but only some these arguments fall under aegis logic proper deductive reasoning concerns logical consequence given premises form reasoning most closely connected logic on narrow conception logic see below logic concerns just deductive reasoning although such narrow conception controversially excludes most what called informal logic from discipline there are other forms reasoning that are rational but that are generally not taken be part logic these include inductive reasoning which covers forms inference that move from collections particular judgements universal judgements abductive reasoning which form inference that goes from observation hypothesis that accounts for reliable data observation seeks explain relevant evidence american philosopher charles sanders peirce 1839–1914 first introduced term guessing peirce said that abduce hypothetical explanation {\displaystyle a} from observed surprising circumstance b {\displaystyle b} surmise that {\displaystyle a} may be true because then b {\displaystyle b} would be matter course thus abduce {\displaystyle a} from b {\displaystyle b} involves determining that {\displaystyle a} sufficient nearly sufficient but not necessary for b {\displaystyle b} while inductive abductive inference are not part logic proper methodology logic has been applied them with some degree success for example notion deductive validity where inference deductively valid if only if there no possible situation which all premises are true but conclusion false exists analogy notion inductive validity strength where inference inductively strong if only if its premises give some degree probability its conclusion whereas notion deductive validity can be rigorously stated for systems formal logic terms well-understood notions semantics inductive validity requires us define reliable generalization some set observations task providing this definition may be approached various ways some less formal than others some these definitions may use logical association rule induction while others may use mathematical models probability such decision trees rival conceptions main article rival conceptions logic logic arose see below from concern with correctness argumentation modern logicians usually wish ensure that logic studies just those arguments that arise from appropriately general forms inference for example thomas hofweber writes stanford encyclopedia philosophy that logic does not however cover good reasoning whole that job theory rationality rather deals with inferences whose validity can be traced back formal features representations that are involved that inference be they linguistic mental other representations by contrast immanuel kant 1724–1804 argued for seeing logic science judgement idea taken up logical philosophical work gottlob frege 1848–1925 but frege's work ambiguous sense that both concerned with laws thought well with laws truth ie both treats logic context theory mind treats logic study abstract formal structures logic has been defined study arguments correct virtue their form this has not been definition taken this article but idea that logic treats special forms argument deductive argument rather than argument general has history logic that dates back at least logicism mathematics 19th 20th centuries advent influence mathematical logic on philosophy consequence taking logic treat special kinds argument that leads identification special kinds truth logical truths with logic equivalently being study logical truth excludes many original objects study logic that are treated informal logic robert brandom has argued against idea that logic study special kind logical truth arguing that instead one can talk logic material inference terminology wilfred sellars with logic making explicit commitments that were originally implicit informal inference history main article history logic aristotle 384–322 bce europe logic was first developed by aristotle aristotelian logic became widely accepted science mathematics remained wide use west until early 19th century aristotle's system logic was responsible for introduction hypothetical syllogism temporal modal logic inductive logic well influential terms such terms predicables syllogisms propositions europe during later medieval period major efforts were made show that aristotle's ideas were compatible with christian faith during high middle ages logic became main focus philosophers who would engage critical logical analyses philosophical arguments often using variations methodology scholasticism william ockham 's influential summa logicae was released by 18th century structured approach arguments had degenerated fallen out favour depicted holberg's satirical play erasmus montanus chinese logical philosopher gongsun long c 325–250 bce proposed paradox one one cannot become two since neither becomes two china tradition scholarly investigation into logic however was repressed by qin dynasty following legalist philosophy han feizi india innovations scholastic school called nyaya continued from ancient times into early 18th century with navya-nyaya school by 16th century developed theories resembling modern logic such gottlob frege's distinction between sense reference proper names his definition number well theory restrictive conditions for universals anticipating some developments modern set theory since indian logic attracted attention many western scholars has had influence on important 19th-century logicians such charles babbage augustus de morgan george boole 20th century western philosophers like stanislaw schayer klaus glashoff have explored indian logic more extensively syllogistic logic developed by aristotle predominated west until mid-19th century when interest foundations mathematics stimulated development symbolic logic now called mathematical logic george boole published investigation laws thought on which are founded mathematical theories logic probabilities introducing symbolic logic principles what now known boolean logic gottlob frege published begriffsschrift which inaugurated modern logic with invention quantifier notation from alfred north whitehead bertrand russell published principia mathematica on foundations mathematics attempting derive mathematical truths from axioms inference rules symbolic logic gödel raised serious problems with foundationalist program logic ceased focus on such issues development logic since frege russell wittgenstein had profound influence on practice philosophy perceived nature philosophical problems see analytic philosophy philosophy mathematics logic especially sentential logic implemented computer logic circuits fundamental computer science logic commonly taught by university philosophy departments often compulsory discipline types syllogistic logic depiction from 15th century square opposition which expresses fundamental dualities syllogistic main article aristotelian logic organon was aristotle's body work on logic with prior analytics constituting first explicit work formal logic introducing syllogistic parts syllogistic logic also known by name term logic are analysis judgements into propositions consisting two terms that are related by one fixed number relations expression inferences by means syllogisms that consist two propositions sharing common term premise conclusion that proposition involving two unrelated terms from premises aristotle's work was regarded classical times from medieval times europe middle east very picture fully worked out system however was not alone stoics proposed system propositional logic that was studied by medieval logicians also problem multiple generality was recognized medieval times nonetheless problems with syllogistic logic were not seen being need revolutionary solutions today some academics claim that aristotle's system generally seen having little more than historical value though there some current interest extending term logics regarded made obsolete by advent propositional logic predicate calculus others use aristotle argumentation theory help develop critically question argumentation schemes that are used artificial intelligence legal arguments propositional logic main article propositional calculus propositional calculus logic also sentential calculus formal system which formulae representing propositions can be formed by combining atomic propositions using logical connectives which system formal proof rules establishes certain formulae theorems example theorem propositional logic → b → {\displaystyle a\rightarrow b\rightarrow a} which says that if holds then b implies predicate logic gottlob frege's begriffschrift introduced notion quantifier graphical notation which here represents judgement that ∀ x f x {\displaystyle \forall xfx} true main article predicate logic predicate logic generic term for symbolic formal systems such first-order logic second-order logic many-sorted logic infinitary logic provides account quantifiers general enough express wide set arguments occurring natural language for example bertrand russell's famous barber paradox there man who shaves all only men who do not shave themselves can be formalised by sentence ∃ x man x ∧ ∀ y man y → shaves x y ↔ ¬ shaves y y {\displaystyle \exists x{\text{man}}x\wedge \forall y{\text{man}}y\rightarrow {\text{shaves}}xy\leftrightarrow \neg {\text{shaves}}yy} using non-logical predicate man x {\displaystyle {\text{man}}x} indicate that x man non-logical relation shaves x y {\displaystyle {\text{shaves}}xy} indicate that x shaves y all other symbols formulae are logical expressing universal existential quantifiers conjunction implication negation biconditional whilst aristotelian syllogistic logic specifies small number forms that relevant part involved judgements may take predicate logic allows sentences be analysed into subject argument several additional ways—allowing predicate logic solve problem multiple generality that had perplexed medieval logicians development predicate logic usually attributed gottlob frege who also credited one founders analytical philosophy but formulation predicate logic most often used today first-order logic presented principles mathematical logic by david hilbert wilhelm ackermann analytical generality predicate logic allowed formalization mathematics drove investigation set theory allowed development alfred tarski's approach model theory provides foundation modern mathematical logic frege's original system predicate logic was second-order rather than first-order second-order logic most prominently defended against criticism willard van orman quine others by george boolos stewart shapiro modal logic main article modal logic languages modality deals with phenomenon that sub-parts sentence may have their semantics modified by special verbs modal particles for example we go games can be modified give we should go games we can go games perhaps we will go games more abstractly we might say that modality affects circumstances which we take assertion be satisfied aristotle's logic large parts concerned with theory non-modalized logic although there are passages his work such famous sea-battle argument de interpretatione § that are now seen anticipations modal logic its connection with potentiality time earliest formal system modal logic was developed by avicenna whom ultimately developed theory temporally modalized syllogistic while study necessity possibility remained important philosophers little logical innovation happened until landmark investigations clarence irving lewis who formulated family rival axiomatizations alethic modalities his work unleashed torrent new work on topic expanding kinds modality treated include deontic logic epistemic logic seminal work arthur prior applied same formal language treat temporal logic paved way for marriage two subjects saul kripke discovered contemporaneously with rivals his theory frame semantics which revolutionized formal technology available modal logicians gave new graph-theoretic way looking at modality that has driven many applications computational linguistics computer science such dynamic logic informal reasoning dialectic main articles informal logic logic dialectic motivation for study logic ancient times was clear so that one may learn distinguish good arguments from bad arguments so become more effective argument oratory perhaps also become better person half works aristotle's organon treat inference occurs informal setting side by side with development syllogistic aristotelian school these informal works on logic were seen complementary aristotle's treatment rhetoric this ancient motivation still alive although no longer takes centre stage picture logic typically dialectical logic forms heart course critical thinking compulsory course at many universities dialectic has been linked logic since ancient times but has not been until recent decades that european american logicians have attempted provide mathematical foundations for logic dialectic by formalising dialectical logic dialectical logic also name given special treatment dialectic hegelian marxist thought there have been pre-formal treatises on argument dialectic from authors such stephen toulmin uses argument nicholas rescher dialectics van eemeren grootendorst pragma-dialectics theories defeasible reasoning can provide foundation for formalisation dialectical logic dialectic itself can be formalised moves game where advocate for truth proposition opponent argue such games can provide formal game semantics for many logics argumentation theory study research informal logic fallacies critical questions they relate

hypothesis modern debate on large cardinal axioms recursion theory captures idea computation logical arithmetic terms its most classical achievements are undecidability entscheidungsproblem by alan turing his presentation church–turing thesis today recursion theory mostly concerned with more refined problem complexity classes—when problem efficiently solvable—and classification degrees unsolvability philosophical logic main article philosophical logic philosophical logic deals with formal descriptions ordinary non-specialist natural language most philosophers assume that bulk everyday reasoning can be captured logic if method methods translate ordinary language into that logic can be found philosophical logic essentially continuation traditional discipline called logic before invention mathematical logic philosophical logic has much greater concern with connection between natural language logic result philosophical logicians have contributed great deal development non-standard logics eg free logics tense logics well various extensions classical logic eg modal logics non-standard semantics for such logics eg kripke's supervaluationism semantics logic logic

untrained logic unaware how formulate argument correctly computational logic main article logic computer science simple toggling circuit expressed using logic gate synchronous register logic cut heart computer science emerged discipline alan turing's work on entscheidungsproblem followed from kurt gödel's work on incompleteness theorems notion general purpose computer that came from this work was fundamental importance designers computer machinery 1940s 1950s 1960s researchers predicted that when human knowledge could be expressed using logic with mathematical notation would be possible create machine that reasons artificial intelligence this was more difficult than expected because complexity human reasoning logic programming program consists set axioms rules logic programming systems such prolog compute consequences axioms rules order answer query today logic extensively applied fields artificial intelligence computer science these fields provide rich source problems formal informal logic argumentation theory one good example how logic being applied artificial intelligence acm computing classification system particular regards section f3 on logics meanings programs f4 on mathematical logic formal languages part theory computer science this work covers formal semantics programming languages well work formal methods such hoare logic boolean logic fundamental computer hardware particularly system's section b2 on arithmetic logic structures relating operatives not many fundamental logical formalisms are essential section i2 on artificial intelligence for example modal logic default logic knowledge representation formalisms methods horn clauses logic programming description logic furthermore computers can be used tools for logicians for example symbolic logic mathematical logic proofs by humans can be computer-assisted using automated theorem proving machines can find check proofs well work with proofs too lengthy write out by hand non-classical logics main article non-classical logic logics discussed above are all bivalent two-valued that they are most naturally understood dividing propositions into true false propositions non-classical logics are those systems that reject various rules classical logic hegel developed his own dialectic logic that extended kant's transcendental logic but also brought back ground by assuring us that neither heaven nor earth neither world mind nor nature there anywhere such abstract 'either–or' understanding maintains whatever exists concrete with difference opposition itself nicolai vasiliev extended law excluded middle law contradiction proposed law excluded fourth logic tolerant contradiction early 20th century jan łukasiewicz investigated extension traditional true/false values include third value possible so inventing ternary logic first multi-valued logic logics such fuzzy logic have since been devised with infinite number degrees truth represented by real number between intuitionistic logic was proposed by lej brouwer correct logic for reasoning about mathematics based upon his rejection law excluded middle part his intuitionism brouwer rejected formalization mathematics but his student arend heyting studied intuitionistic logic formally did gerhard gentzen intuitionistic logic great interest computer scientists constructive logic can be applied for extracting verified programs from proofs modal logic not truth conditional so has often been proposed non-classical logic however modal logic normally formalized with principle excluded middle its relational semantics bivalent so this inclusion disputable controversies logic empirical main article logic empirical what epistemological status laws logic what sort argument appropriate for criticizing purported principles logic influential paper entitled logic empirical hilary putnam building on suggestion w v quine argued that general facts propositional logic have similar epistemological status facts about physical universe for example laws mechanics general relativity particular that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles classical logic if we want be realists about physical phenomena described by quantum theory then we should abandon principle distributivity substituting for classical logic quantum logic proposed by garrett birkhoff john von neumann another paper same name by michael dummett argues that putnam's desire for realism mandates law distributivity distributivity logic essential for realist's understanding how propositions are true world just same way he has argued principle bivalence this way question logic empirical can be seen lead naturally into fundamental controversy metaphysics on realism versus anti-realism implication strict material main article paradoxes material implication notion implication formalized classical logic does not comfortably translate into natural language by means if then due number problems called paradoxes material implication first class paradoxes involves counterfactuals such if moon made green cheese then 2+2=5 which are puzzling because natural language does not support principle explosion eliminating this class paradoxes was reason for c i lewis's formulation strict implication which eventually led more radically revisionist logics such relevance logic second class paradoxes involves redundant premises falsely suggesting that we know succedent because antecedent thus if that man gets elected granny will die materially true since granny mortal regardless man's election prospects such sentences violate gricean maxim relevance can be modelled by logics that reject principle monotonicity entailment such relevance logic tolerating impossible main article paraconsistent logic hegel was deeply critical any simplified notion law non-contradiction was based on leibniz's idea that this law logic also requires sufficient ground specify from what point view time one says that something cannot contradict itself building for example both moves does not move ground for first our solar system for second earth hegelian dialectic law non-contradiction identity itself relies upon difference so not independently assertable closely related questions arising from paradoxes implication comes suggestion that logic ought tolerate inconsistency relevance logic paraconsistent logic are most important approaches here though concerns are different key consequence classical logic some its rivals such intuitionistic logic that they respect principle explosion which means that logic collapses if capable deriving contradiction graham priest main proponent dialetheism has argued for paraconsistency on grounds that there are fact true contradictions rejection logical truth philosophical vein various kinds skepticism contains many kinds doubt rejection various bases on which logic rests such idea logical form correct inference meaning typically leading conclusion that there are no logical truths observe that this opposite usual views philosophical skepticism where logic directs skeptical enquiry doubt received wisdoms work sextus empiricus friedrich nietzsche provides strong example rejection usual basis logic his radical rejection idealization led him reject truth mobile army metaphors metonyms anthropomorphisms—in short metaphors which are worn out without sensuous power coins which have lost their pictures now matter only metal no longer coins his rejection truth did not lead him reject idea either inference logic completely but rather suggested that logic into existence man's head illogic whose realm originally must have been immense innumerable beings who made inferences way different from ours perished thus there idea that logical inference has use tool for human survival but that its existence does not support existence truth nor does have reality beyond instrumental logic too also rests on assumptions that do not correspond anything real world this position held by nietzsche however has come under extreme scrutiny for several reasons some philosophers such jürgen habermas claim his position self-refuting—and accuse nietzsche not even having coherent perspective let alone theory knowledge georg lukács his book destruction reason asserts that were we study nietzsche's statements this area from logico-philosophical angle we would be confronted by dizzy chaos most lurid assertions arbitrary violently incompatible bertrand russell described nietzsche's irrational claims with he
