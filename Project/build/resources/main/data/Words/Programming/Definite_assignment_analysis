definite assignment analysis from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search computer science definite assignment analysis data-flow analysis used by compilers conservatively ensure that variable location always assigned before used contents motivation terminology analysis references motivation c c++ programs source particularly difficult-to-diagnose errors nondeterministic behavior that results from reading uninitialized variables this behavior can vary between platforms builds even from run run there are two common ways solve this problem one ensure that all locations are written before they are read rice's theorem establishes that this problem cannot be solved general for all programs however possible create conservative imprecise analysis that will accept only programs that satisfy this constraint while rejecting some correct programs definite assignment analysis such analysis java c programming language specifications require that compiler report compile-time error if analysis fails both languages require specific form analysis that spelled out meticulous detail java this analysis was formalized by stärk et al some correct programs are rejected must be altered introduce explicit unnecessary assignments c this analysis was formalized by fruja precise well sound sense that all variables assigned along all control flow paths will be considered definitely assigned cyclone language also requires programs pass definite assignment analysis but only on variables with pointer types ease porting c programs second way solve problem automatically initialize all locations some fixed predictable value at point at which they are defined but this introduces new assignments that may impede performance this case definite assignment analysis enables compiler optimization where redundant assignments — assignments followed only by other assignments with no possible intervening reads — can be eliminated this case no programs are rejected but programs for which analysis fails recognize definite assignment may contain redundant initialization common language infrastructure relies on this approach terminology variable location can be said be one three states at any given point program definitely assigned variable known with certainty be assigned definitely unassigned variable known with certainty be unassigned unknown variable may be assigned unassigned analysis not precise enough determine which analysis following based on fruja's formalization c intraprocedural single method definite assignment analysis which responsible for ensuring that all local variables are assigned before they are used simultaneously does definite assignment analysis constant propagation boolean values we define five static functions name domain description before all statements expressions variables definitely assigned before evaluation given statement expression after all statements expressions variables definitely assigned after evaluation given statement expression assuming completes normally vars all statements expressions all variables available scope given statement expression true all boolean expressions variables definitely assigned after evaluation given expression assuming expression evaluates true false all boolean expressions variables definitely assigned after evaluation given expression assuming expression evaluates false we supply data-flow equations that define values these functions on various expressions statements terms values functions on their syntactic subexpressions assume for moment that there are no goto break continue return exception handling statements following are few examples these equations any expression statement e that does not affect set variables definitely assigned aftere = beforee let e be assignment expression loc = v then beforev = before e aftere = afterv u {loc} let e be expression true then truee = beforee falsee = varse other words if e evaluates false all variables are vacuously definitely assigned because e does not evaluate false since method arguments are evaluated left right beforeargi + = afterargi after method completes out parameters are definitely assigned let s be conditional statement if e s1 else s2 then beforee = befores befores1 = truee befores2 = falsee after s = afters1 intersect afters2 let s be while loop statement while e s1 then beforee = befores befores1 = truee afters = falsee so on at beginning method no local variables are definitely assigned verifier repeatedly iterates over abstract syntax tree uses data-flow equations migrate information between sets until fixed point can be reached then verifier examines before set every expression that uses local variable ensure that contains that variable algorithm complicated by introduction control-flow jumps like goto break continue return exception handling any statement that can be target one these jumps must intersect its before set with set definitely assigned variables at jump source when these are introduced resulting data flow may have multiple fixed points this example int i = l goto l since label l can be reached from two locations control-flow equation for goto dictates that before2 = after1 intersect before3 but before3 = before2 so before2 = after1 intersect before2 this has two fixed-points for before2 {i} empty set however can be shown that because monotonic form data-flow equations there unique maximal fixed point fixed point largest size that provides most possible information about definitely assigned variables such maximal maximum fixed point may be computed by standard techniques see data-flow analysis additional issue that control-flow jump may render certain control flows infeasible for example this code
