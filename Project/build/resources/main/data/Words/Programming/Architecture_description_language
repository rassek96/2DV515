architecture description language from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search architecture description languages adls are used several disciplines system engineering software engineering enterprise modelling engineering system engineering community uses architecture description language language and/or conceptual model describe represent system architectures software engineering community uses architecture description language computer language create description software architecture case so-called technical architecture architecture must be communicated software developers functional architecture communicated various stakeholders users some adls that have been developed are acme developed by cmu aadl standardized by sae c2 developed by uci sbc-adl developed by national sun yat-sen university darwin developed by imperial college london wright developed by cmu up-to-date list currently existing architectural languages might be found at up-to-date list adls iso/iec/ieee document systems software engineering—architecture description defines architecture description language any form expression for use architecture descriptions specifies minimum requirements on adls enterprise modelling engineering community have also developed architecture description languages catered for at enterprise level examples include archimate now standard open group demo abacus developed by university technology sydney these languages do not necessarily refer software components etc most them however refer application architecture architecture that communicated software engineers most writing below refers primarily perspective from software engineering community contents introduction history characteristics o positive elements adl o negative elements adl common concepts architecture o object connection architecture o interface connection architecture architecture vs design examples approaches architecture see also references external links introduction standard notation adl for representing architectures helps promote mutual communication embodiment early design decisions creation transferable abstraction system architectures past were largely represented by box-and-line drawing annotated with such things nature component properties semantics connections overall system behavior adls result from linguistic approach formal representation architectures such they address its shortcomings also important sophisticated adls allow for early analysis feasibility testing architectural design decisions history adls have been classified into three broad categories box-and-line informal drawings formal architecture description language uml-based notations box-and-line have been for long time most predominant means for describing sas while providing useful documentation level informality limited usefulness architecture description more rigorous way for describing sas was required quoting allen garlan while these descriptions may provide useful documentation current level informality limits their usefulness since generally imprecise what meant by such architectural descriptions may be impossible analyze architecture for consistency determine non-trivial properties moreover there no way check that system implementation faithful its architectural design similar conclusion drawn perry wolf which reports that aside from providing clear precise documentation primary purpose specifications provide automated analysis documents expose various kinds problems that would otherwise go undetected since then thread research on formal languages for sa description has been carried out tens formal adls have been proposed each characterized by different conceptual architectural elements different syntax semantics focusing on specific operational domain only suitable for different analysis techniques for example domain-specific adls have been presented deal with embedded real-time systems such aadl east-adl eadl control-loop applications diaspec product line architectures koala dynamic systems π-adl analysis-specific adls have been proposed deal with availability reliability security resource consumption data quality real-time performance analysis aadl behavioral analysis fractal trustworthiness analysis tadl however these efforts have not seen desired adoption by industrial practice some reasons for this lack industry adoption have been analyzed by woods hilliard pandey clements others formal adls have been rarely integrated software life-cycle they are seldom supported by mature tools scarcely documented focusing on very specific needs leaving no space for extensions enabling addition new features way overcome some those limitations uml has been indicated possible successor existing adls many proposals have been presented use extend uml more properly model software architectures fact highlighted recent study conducted with practitioners whilst practitioners are generally satisfied with design capabilities provided by languages they use they are dissatisfied with architectural language analysis features their abilities define extra-functional properties architectural languages used practice mostly originate from industrial development instead from academic research more formality better usability are required architectural language characteristics there large variety adls developed by either academic industrial groups many languages were not intended be adl but they turn out be suitable for representing analyzing architecture principle adls differ from requirements languages because adls are rooted solution space whereas requirements describe problem spaces they differ from programming languages because adls do not bind architectural abstractions specific point solutions modeling languages represent behaviors where adls focus on representation components however there are domain specific modeling languages dsmls that focus on representation components minimal requirements language must be suitable for communicating architecture all interested parties support tasks architecture creation refinement validation provide basis for further implementation so must be able add information adl specification enable final system specification be derived from adl provide ability represent most common architectural styles support analytical capabilities provide quick generating prototype implementations adls have common graphical syntax with often textual form formally defined syntax semantics features for modeling distributed systems little support for capturing design information except through general purpose annotation mechanisms ability represent hierarchical levels detail including creation substructures by instantiating templates adls differ their ability handle real-time constructs such deadlines task priorities at architectural level support specification different architectural styles few handle object oriented class inheritance dynamic architectures support analysis architecture handle different instantiations same architecture relation product line architectures positive elements adl adls are formal way representing architecture adls are intended be both human machine readable adls support describing system at higher level than previously possible adls permit analysis assessment architectures for completeness consistency ambiguity performance adls can support automatic generation software systems negative elements adl there no universal agreement on what adls should represent particularly regards behavior architecture representations currently use are relatively difficult parse are not supported by commercial tools most adls tend be very vertically optimized toward particular kind analysis common concepts architecture adl community generally agrees that software architecture set components connections among them but there are different kind architectures like object connection architecture configuration consists interfaces connections object-oriented system interfaces specify features that must be provided by modules conforming interface connections represented by interfaces together with call graph conformance usually enforced by programming language o decomposition — associating interfaces with unique modules o interface conformance — static checking syntactic rules o communication integrity — visibility between modules interface connection architecture expands role interfaces connections o interfaces specify both required provided features o connections are defined between required features provided features consists interfaces connections constraints o constraints restrict behavior interfaces connections architecture o constraints architecture map requirements for system most adls implement interface connection architecture architecture vs design what difference between architecture design architecture context software systems roughly divided into categories primarily software architecture network architecture systems architecture within each these categories there tangible but fuzzy distinction between architecture design draw this distinction universally clearly possible best consider design noun rather than verb so that comparison between two nouns design abstraction specification patterns organs functionality that have been will be implemented architecture degree higher both abstraction granularity consequentially architecture also more topological nature than design that specifies where major components meet how they relate one another architecture focuses on partitioning major regions functionality into high level components where they will physically virtually reside what off-the-shelf components may be employed effectively general what interfaces each component will expose what protocols will be employed between them what practices high level patterns may best meet extensibility maintainability reliability durability scalability other non-functional objectives design detailing these choices more concrete clarification how functional requirements will be met through delegation pieces that functionality more granular components how these smaller components will be organized within larger ones oftentimes portion architecture done during conceptualization application system network may appear non-functional sections requirement documentation canonically design not specified requirements but rather driven by them process defining architecture may involve heuristics acquired by architect architectural team through experience within domain with design architecture often evolves through series iterations just wisdom high level design often tested when low level design implementation occurs wisdom architecture tested during specification high level design both cases if wisdom specification called into question during detailing another iteration either architecture design case may be may become necessary summary primary differences between architecture design are ones granularity abstraction consequentially chronology architecture generally precedes design
