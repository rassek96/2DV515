explication de l'arithmétique binaire published systems related binary numbers have appeared earlier multiple cultures including ancient egypt china india leibniz was specifically inspired by chinese i ching egypt see also ancient egyptian mathematics arithmetic values represented by parts eye horus scribes ancient egypt used two different systems for their fractions egyptian fractions not related binary number system horus-eye fractions so called because many historians mathematics believe that symbols used for this system could be arranged form eye horus although this has been disputed horus-eye fractions are binary numbering system for fractional quantities grain liquids other measures which fraction hekat expressed sum binary fractions 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 1/64 early forms this system can be found documents from fifth dynasty egypt approximately bc its fully developed hieroglyphic form dates nineteenth dynasty egypt approximately bc method used for ancient egyptian multiplication also closely related binary numbers this method multiplying one number by second performed by sequence steps which value initially first two numbers either doubled has first number added back into order which these steps are be performed given by binary representation second number this method can be seen use for instance rhind mathematical papyrus which dates around bc china daoist bagua i ching dates from 9th century bc china binary notation i ching used interpret its quaternary divination technique based on taoistic duality yin yang eight trigrams bagua set hexagrams sixty-four gua analogous three-bit six-bit binary numerals were use at least early zhou dynasty ancient china contemporary scholar shao yong rearranged hexagrams format that resembles modern binary numbers although he did not intend his arrangement be used mathematically viewing least significant bit on top single hexagrams shao yong's square reading along rows either from bottom right top left with solid lines broken lines from top left bottom right with solid lines broken lines hexagrams can be interpreted sequence from india indian scholar pingala c 2nd century bc developed binary system for describing prosody he used binary numbers form short long syllables latter equal length two short syllables making similar morse code pingala's hindu classic titled chandaḥśāstra describes formation matrix order give unique value each meter binary representations pingala's system increases towards right not left like binary numbers modern western positional notation other cultures residents island mangareva french polynesia were using hybrid binary-decimal system before slit drums with binary tones are used encode messages across africa asia sets binary combinations similar i ching have also been used traditional african divination systems such ifá well medieval western geomancy base-2 system utilized geomancy had long been widely applied sub-saharan africa western predecessors leibniz francis bacon discussed system whereby letters alphabet could be reduced sequences binary digits which could then be encoded scarcely visible variations font any random text importantly for general theory binary encoding he added that this method could be used with any objects at all provided those objects be capable twofold difference only by bells by trumpets by lights torches by report muskets any instruments like nature see bacon's cipher leibniz i ching gottfried leibniz full title leibniz's article translated into english explanation binary arithmetic which uses only characters with some remarks on its usefulness on light throws on ancient chinese figures fu xi leibniz's system uses like modern binary numeral system example leibniz's binary numeral system follows numerical value numerical value numerical value numerical value leibniz interpreted hexagrams i ching evidence binary calculus sinophile leibniz was aware i ching noted with fascination how its hexagrams correspond binary numbers from concluded that this mapping was evidence major chinese accomplishments sort philosophical mathematics he admired leibniz was first introduced i ching through his contact with french jesuit joachim bouvet who visited china missionary leibniz saw i ching hexagrams affirmation universality his own religious beliefs christian binary numerals were central leibniz's theology he believed that binary numbers were symbolic christian idea creatio ex nihilo creation out nothing not easy impart pagans creation ex nihilo through god's almighty power now one can say that nothing world can better present demonstrate this power than origin numbers presented here through simple unadorned presentation one zero nothing — leibniz's letter duke brunswick attached with i ching hexagrams later developments george boole british mathematician george boole published landmark paper detailing algebraic system logic that would become known boolean algebra his logical calculus was become instrumental design digital electronic circuitry claude shannon produced his master's thesis at mit that implemented boolean algebra binary arithmetic using electronic relays switches for first time history entitled symbolic analysis relay switching circuits shannon's thesis essentially founded practical digital circuit design november george stibitz then working at

magnetic polarities may be used positive yes on state not necessarily equivalent numerical value one depends on architecture use keeping with customary representation numerals using arabic numerals binary numbers are commonly written using symbols when written binary numerals are often subscripted prefixed suffixed order indicate their base radix following notations are equivalent binary

binary notation %100101 prefix indicating binary format also known motorola convention 0b100101 prefix indicating binary format common programming languages 6b100101 prefix indicating number bits binary format common programming languages when spoken binary numerals are usually read digit-by-digit order distinguish them from decimal numerals for example binary numeral pronounced one zero zero rather than one hundred make its binary nature explicit for purposes correctness since binary numeral represents value four would be confusing refer numeral one hundred word that represents completely different value amount alternatively binary numeral can be read out four correct value but this does not make its binary nature explicit counting binary decimal pattern binary number counting binary similar counting any other number system beginning with single digit counting proceeds through each symbol increasing order before examining binary counting useful briefly discuss more familiar decimal counting system frame reference decimal counting decimal counting uses ten symbols through counting begins with incremental substitution least significant digit rightmost digit which often called first digit when available symbols for this position are exhausted least significant digit reset next digit higher significance one position left incremented overflow incremental substitution low-order digit resumes this method reset overflow repeated for each digit significance counting progresses follows rightmost digit reset zero digit its left incremented rightmost two digits are reset zeroes next digit incremented binary counting this counter shows how count binary from numbers zero through thirty-one binary counting follows same procedure except that only two symbols are available thus after digit reaches binary increment resets but also causes increment next digit left rightmost digit starts over next digit incremented rightmost two digits start over next digit incremented rightmost three digits start over next digit incremented binary system each digit represents increasing power with rightmost digit representing next representing then so on equivalent decimal representation binary number sum powers which each digit represents for example binary number converted decimal form follows = + + + + + = + + + + + = fractions fractions binary only terminate if denominator has only prime factor result 1/10 does not have finite binary representation this causes × not be precisely equal floating point arithmetic example interpret binary expression for 1/3 = this means 1/3 = × 2−1 + × 2−2 + × 2−3 + × 2−4 + = + exact value cannot be found with sum finite number inverse powers two zeros ones binary representation 1/3 alternate forever fraction decimal binary fractional approximation 1/1 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 1/2 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 1/3 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 1/4 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 1/5 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/128 1/6 1/8 + 1/32 + 1/128 1/7 1/8 + 1/64 + 1/512 1/8 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 1/9 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 1/10 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/256 1/11 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/128 1/12 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 1/13 1/16 + 1/128 + 1/256 1/14 1/16 + 1/128 + 1/1024 1/15 1/16 + 1/256 1/16 1/32 + 1/64 + 1/128 binary arithmetic arithmetic binary much like arithmetic other numeral systems addition subtraction multiplication division can be performed on binary numerals addition main article binary adder circuit diagram for binary half adder which adds two bits together producing sum carry bits simplest arithmetic operation binary addition adding two single-digit binary numbers relatively simple using form carrying + → + → + → + → carry since + = = + × adding two digits produces digit while will have be added next column this similar what happens decimal when certain single-digit numbers are added together if result equals exceeds value radix digit left incremented + → carry since + = = + × + → carry since + = = + × this known carrying when result addition exceeds value digit procedure carry excess amount divided by radix that 10/10 left adding next positional value this correct since next position has weight that higher by factor equal radix carrying works same way binary carried digits + ------------- = = this example two numerals are being added together top row shows carry bits used starting rightmost column + = carried left written at bottom rightmost column second column from right added + + = again carried written at bottom third column + + = this time carried written bottom row proceeding like this gives final answer decimal when computers must add two numbers rule that x xor y = x + y mod for any two bits x y allows for very fast calculation well long carry method simplification for many binary addition problems long carry method brookhouse method binary addition this method generally useful any binary addition where one numbers contains long string ones based on simple premise that under binary system when given string digits composed entirely n ones where n any integer length adding will result number followed by string n zeros that concept follows logically just decimal system where adding string n 9s will result number followed by string n 0s binary decimal likewise + + ——————————— ——————————— such long strings are quite common binary system from that one finds that large binary numbers can be added using two simple steps without excessive carry operations following example two numerals are being added together using traditional carry method on left long carry method on right traditional carry method long carry method vs carried digits ← ← carry until one digit past string below cross out string + + cross out digit that was added ——————————————————————— —————————————————————— = top row shows carry bits used instead standard carry from one column next lowest-ordered with corresponding place value beneath may be added may be carried one digit past end series used numbers must be crossed off since they are already added other long strings may likewise be cancelled using same technique then simply add together any remaining digits normally proceeding this manner gives final answer our simple example using small numbers traditional carry method required eight carry operations yet long carry method required only two representing substantial reduction effort addition table binary addition table similar but not same truth table logical disjunction operation ∨ {\displaystyle \lor } difference that {\displaystyle 1} ∨ {\displaystyle \lor } = {\displaystyle 1=1} while + = {\displaystyle 1+1=10} subtraction further information signed number representations two's complement subtraction works much same way − → − → borrow − → − → subtracting digit from digit produces digit while will have be subtracted from next column this known borrowing principle same for carrying when result subtraction less than least possible value digit procedure borrow deficit divided by radix that 10/10 from left subtracting from next positional value starred columns are borrowed from − ---------------- = starred columns are borrowed from - ---------------- = subtracting positive number equivalent adding negative number equal absolute value computers use signed number representations handle negative numbers—most commonly two's complement notation such representations eliminate need for separate subtract operation using two's complement notation subtraction can be summarized by following formula − b = + not b + multiplication multiplication binary similar its decimal counterpart two numbers b can be multiplied by partial products for each digit b product that digit calculated written on new line shifted leftward so that its rightmost digit lines up with digit b that was used sum all these partial products gives final result since there are only two digits binary there are only two possible outcomes each partial multiplication if digit b partial product also if digit b partial product equal for example binary numbers are multiplied follows × b --------- ← corresponds rightmost 'zero' b + ← corresponds next 'one' b + + --------------- = binary numbers can also be multiplied with bits after binary point decimal × b decimal ------------------- ← corresponds 'one' b + ← corresponds 'zero' b + + + --------------------------- = decimal see also booth's multiplication algorithm multiplication table binary multiplication table same truth table logical conjunction operation ∧ {\displaystyle \land } division see also division algorithm long division binary again similar its decimal counterpart example below divisor decimal while dividend decimal procedure same that decimal long division here divisor goes into first three digits dividend one time so written on top line this result multiplied by divisor subtracted from first three digits dividend next digit included obtain new three-digit sequence − ----- procedure then repeated with new sequence continuing until digits dividend have been exhausted − ----- − ----- thus quotient divided by shown on top line while remainder shown on bottom line decimal divided by with remainder square root process taking binary square root digit by digit same for decimal square root explained here example --------- √ --------- -------- -------- ------- bitwise operations main article bitwise operation though not directly related numerical interpretation binary symbols sequences bits may be manipulated using boolean logical operators when string binary symbols manipulated this way called bitwise operation logical operators xor may be performed on corresponding bits two binary numerals provided input logical not operation may be performed on individual bits single binary numeral provided input sometimes such operations may be used arithmetic short-cuts may have other computational benefits well for example arithmetic shift left binary number equivalent multiplication by positive integral power conversion from other numeral systems decimal conversion binary notation results convert from base-10 integer its base-2 binary equivalent number divided by two remainder least-significant bit quotient again divided by two its remainder becomes next least significant bit this process repeats until quotient one reached sequence remainders including final quotient one forms binary value each remainder must be either zero one when dividing by two for example expressed conversion from base-2 base-10 simply inverts preceding algorithm bits binary number are used one by one starting with most significant leftmost bit beginning with value prior value doubled next bit then added produce next value this can be organized multi-column table for example convert decimal prior value × + next bit next value × + = × + = × + = × + = × + = × + = × + = × + = × + = × + = × + = result note that first prior value simply initial decimal value this method application horner scheme binary decimal 1×210 + 0×29 + 0×28 + 1×27 + 0×26 + 1×25 + 0×24 + 1×23 + 1×22 + 0×21 + 1×20 = fractional parts number are converted with similar methods they are again based on equivalence shifting with doubling halving fractional binary number such first digit {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{\frac {1}{2}}\end{matrix}}} second = {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{\frac {1}{2}}^{2}={\frac {1}{4}}\end{matrix}}} etc so if there first place after decimal then number at least {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{\frac {1}{2}}\end{matrix}}} vice versa double that number at least this suggests algorithm repeatedly double number be converted record if result at least then throw away integer part for example {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{\frac {1}{3}}\end{matrix}}} binary converting result {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{\frac {1}{3}}\end{matrix}}} × =
