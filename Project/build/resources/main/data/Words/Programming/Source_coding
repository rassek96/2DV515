data compression source coding bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than original representation compression can be either lossy lossless lossless compression reduces bits by identifying eliminating statistical redundancy no information lost lossless compression lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary less important information process reducing size data file referred data compression context data transmission called source coding encoding done at source data before stored transmitted opposition channel coding compression useful because reduces resources required store transmit data computational resources are consumed compression process usually reversal process decompression data compression subject space–time complexity trade-off for instance compression scheme for video may require expensive hardware for video be decompressed fast enough be viewed being decompressed option decompress video full before watching may be inconvenient require additional storage design data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors including degree compression amount distortion introduced when using lossy data compression computational resources required compress decompress data contents lossless lossy theory o machine learning o data differencing uses o audio + lossy audio compression coding methods speech encoding + history o video + encoding theory + timeline o genetics o emulation outlook currently unused potential see also references external links lossless lossless data compression algorithms usually exploit statistical redundancy represent data without losing any information so that process reversible lossless compression possible because most real-world data exhibits statistical redundancy for example image may have areas color that do not change over several pixels instead coding red pixel red pixel data may be encoded red pixels this basic example run-length encoding there are many schemes reduce file size by eliminating redundancy lempel–ziv lz compression methods are among most popular algorithms for lossless storage deflate variation on lz optimized for decompression speed compression ratio but compression can be slow deflate used pkzip gzip png lzw lempel–ziv–welch used gif images also noteworthy lzr lempel-ziv–renau algorithm which serves basis for zip method lz methods use table-based compression model where table entries are substituted for repeated strings data for most lz methods this table generated dynamically from earlier data input table itself often huffman encoded eg shri lzx current lz-based coding schemes that perform well are brotli lzx lzx used microsoft's cab format best modern lossless compressors use probabilistic models such prediction by partial matching burrows–wheeler transform can also be viewed indirect form statistical modelling class grammar-based codes are gaining popularity because they can compress highly repetitive input extremely effectively for instance biological data collection same closely related species huge versioned document collection internet archival etc basic task grammar-based codes constructing context-free grammar deriving single string sequitur re-pair are practical grammar compression algorithms for which software publicly available further refinement direct use probabilistic modelling statistical estimates can be coupled algorithm called arithmetic coding arithmetic coding more modern coding technique that uses mathematical calculations finite-state machine produce string encoded bits from series input data symbols can achieve superior compression other techniques such better-known huffman algorithm uses internal memory state avoid need perform one-to-one mapping individual input symbols distinct representations that use integer number bits clears out internal memory only after encoding entire string data symbols arithmetic coding applies especially well adaptive data compression tasks where statistics vary are context-dependent can be easily coupled with adaptive model probability distribution input data early example use arithmetic coding was its use optional but not widely used feature jpeg image coding standard has since been applied various other designs including h264/mpeg-4 avc hevc for video coding lossy lossy data compression converse lossless data compression these schemes some loss information acceptable dropping nonessential detail from data source can save storage space lossy data compression schemes are designed by research on how people perceive data question for example human eye more sensitive subtle variations luminance than variations color jpeg image compression works part by rounding off nonessential bits information there corresponding trade-off between preserving information reducing size number popular compression formats exploit these perceptual differences including those used music files images video lossy image compression can be used digital cameras increase storage capacities with minimal degradation picture quality similarly dvds use lossy mpeg-2 video coding format for video compression lossy audio compression methods psychoacoustics are used remove non-audible less audible components audio signal compression human speech often performed with even more specialized techniques speech coding voice coding sometimes distinguished separate discipline from audio compression different audio speech compression standards are listed under audio coding formats voice compression used internet telephony for example audio compression used for cd ripping decoded by audio players theory theoretical background compression provided by information theory which closely related algorithmic information theory for lossless compression rate–distortion theory for lossy compression these areas study were essentially forged by claude shannon who published fundamental papers on topic late 1940s early 1950s coding theory also related this idea data compression also deeply connected with statistical inference machine learning see also machine learning there close connection between machine learning compression system that predicts posterior probabilities sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression by using arithmetic coding on output distribution while optimal compressor can be used for prediction by finding symbol that compresses best given previous history this equivalence has been used justification for using data compression benchmark for general intelligence data differencing main article data differencing data compression can be viewed special case data differencing data differencing consists producing difference given source target with patching producing target given source difference while data compression consists producing compressed file given target decompression consists producing target given only compressed file thus one can consider data compression data differencing with empty source data compressed file corresponding difference from nothing this same considering absolute entropy corresponding data compression special case relative entropy corresponding data differencing with no initial data when one wishes emphasize connection one may use term differential compression refer data differencing uses audio see also audio codec audio coding format audio data compression not be confused with dynamic range compression has potential reduce transmission bandwidth storage requirements audio data audio compression algorithms are implemented software audio codecs lossy audio compression algorithms provide higher compression at cost fidelity are used numerous audio applications these algorithms almost all rely on psychoacoustics eliminate reduce fidelity less audible sounds thereby reducing space required store transmit them both lossy lossless compression information redundancy reduced using methods such coding pattern recognition linear prediction reduce amount information used represent uncompressed data acceptable trade-off between loss audio quality transmission storage size depends upon application for example one 640mb compact disc cd holds approximately one hour uncompressed high fidelity music less than hours music compressed losslessly hours music compressed mp3 format at medium bit rate digital sound recorder can typically store around hours clearly intelligible speech 640mb lossless audio compression produces representation digital data that decompress exact digital duplicate original audio stream unlike playback from lossy compression techniques such vorbis mp3 compression ratios are around 50–60% original size which similar those for generic lossless data compression lossless compression unable attain high compression ratios due complexity waveforms rapid changes sound forms codecs like flac shorten tta use linear prediction estimate spectrum signal many these algorithms use convolution with filter slightly whiten flatten spectrum thereby allowing traditional lossless compression work more efficiently process reversed upon decompression when audio files are be processed either by further compression for editing desirable work from unchanged original uncompressed losslessly compressed processing lossily compressed file for some purpose usually produces final result inferior creation same compressed file from uncompressed original addition sound editing mixing lossless audio compression often used for archival storage master copies

correction easily obtain lossy file such formats include mpeg-4 sls scalable lossless wavpack optimfrog dualstream other formats are associated with distinct system such direct stream transfer used super audio cd meridian lossless packing used dvd-audio dolby truehd blu-ray hd dvd lossy audio compression comparison acoustic spectrograms song uncompressed format lossy formats that lossy spectrograms are different from uncompressed one indicates that they are fact lossy but nothing can be assumed about effect changes on perceived quality lossy audio compression used wide range applications addition direct applications mp3 players computers digitally compressed audio streams are used most video dvds digital television streaming media on internet satellite cable radio increasingly terrestrial radio broadcasts lossy compression typically achieves far greater compression than lossless compression data percent percent original stream rather than percent percent by discarding less-critical data innovation lossy audio compression was use psychoacoustics recognize that not all data audio stream can be perceived by human auditory system most lossy compression reduces perceptual redundancy by first identifying perceptually irrelevant sounds that sounds that are very hard hear typical examples include high frequencies sounds that occur at same time louder sounds those sounds are coded with decreased accuracy not at all due nature lossy algorithms audio quality suffers when file decompressed recompressed digital generation loss this makes lossy compression unsuitable for storing intermediate results professional audio engineering applications such sound editing multitrack recording however they are very popular with end users particularly mp3 megabyte can store about minute's worth music at adequate quality coding methods determine what information audio signal perceptually irrelevant most lossy compression algorithms use transforms such modified discrete cosine transform mdct convert time domain sampled waveforms into transform domain once transformed typically into frequency domain component frequencies can be allocated bits according how audible they are audibility spectral components calculated using absolute threshold hearing principles simultaneous masking—the phenomenon wherein signal masked by another signal separated by frequency—and some cases temporal masking—where signal masked by another signal separated by time equal-loudness contours may also be used weight perceptual importance components models human ear-brain combination incorporating such effects are often called psychoacoustic models other types lossy compressors such linear predictive coding lpc used with speech are source-based coders these coders use model sound's generator such human vocal tract with lpc whiten audio signal ie flatten its spectrum before quantization lpc may be thought basic perceptual coding technique reconstruction audio signal using linear predictor shapes coder's quantization noise into spectrum target signal partially masking lossy formats are often used for distribution streaming audio interactive applications such coding speech for digital transmission cell phone networks such applications data must be decompressed data flows rather than after entire data stream has been transmitted not all audio codecs can be used for streaming applications for such applications codec designed stream data effectively will usually be chosen latency results from methods used encode decode data some codecs will analyze longer segment data optimize efficiency then code manner that requires larger segment data at one time decode often codecs create segments called frame create discrete data segments for encoding decoding inherent latency coding algorithm can be critical for example when there two-way transmission data such with telephone conversation significant delays may seriously degrade perceived quality contrast speed compression which proportional number operations required by algorithm here latency refers number samples that must be analysed before block audio processed minimum case latency zero samples eg if coder/decoder simply reduces number bits used quantize signal time domain algorithms such lpc also often have low latencies hence their popularity speech coding for telephony algorithms such mp3 however large number samples have be analyzed implement psychoacoustic model frequency domain latency on order ms ms for two-way communication speech encoding speech encoding important category audio data compression perceptual models used estimate what human ear can hear are generally somewhat different from those used for music range frequencies needed convey sounds human voice are normally far narrower than that needed for music sound normally less complex result speech can be encoded at high quality using relatively low bit rate if data be compressed analog such voltage that varies with time quantization employed digitize into numbers normally integers this referred analog-to-digital a/d conversion if integers generated by quantization are bits each then entire range analog signal divided into intervals all signal values within interval are quantized same number if 16-bit integers are generated then range analog signal divided into intervals this relation illustrates compromise between high resolution large number analog intervals high compression small integers generated this application quantization used by several speech compression methods this accomplished general by some combination two approaches only encoding sounds that could be made by single human voice throwing away more data signal—keeping just enough reconstruct intelligible voice rather than full frequency range human hearing perhaps earliest algorithms used speech encoding audio data compression general were a-law algorithm µ-law algorithm history solidyne world's first commercial audio bit compression card for pc literature compendium for large variety audio coding systems was published ieee journal on selected areas communications jsac february while there were some papers from before that time this collection documented entire variety finished working audio coders nearly all them using perceptual ie masking techniques some kind frequency analysis back-end noiseless coding several these papers remarked on difficulty obtaining good clean digital audio for research purposes most if not all authors jsac edition were also active mpeg-1 audio committee world's first commercial broadcast automation audio compression system was developed by oscar bonello engineering professor at university buenos aires using psychoacoustic principle masking critical bands first published he started developing practical application based on recently developed ibm pc computer broadcast automation system was launched under name audicom twenty years later almost all radio stations world were using similar technology manufactured by number companies video see also video coding format video codec video compression uses modern coding techniques reduce redundancy video data most video compression algorithms codecs combine spatial image compression temporal motion compensation video compression practical implementation source coding information theory practice most video codecs also use audio compression techniques parallel compress separate but combined data streams one package majority video compression algorithms use lossy compression uncompressed video requires very high data rate although lossless video compression codecs perform at compression factor 5-12 typical mpeg-4 lossy compression video has compression factor between all lossy compression there trade-off between video quality cost processing compression decompression system requirements highly compressed video may present visible distracting artifacts some video compression schemes typically operate on square-shaped groups neighboring pixels often called macroblocks these pixel groups blocks pixels are compared from one frame next video compression codec sends only differences within those blocks areas video with more motion compression must encode more data keep up with larger number pixels that are changing commonly during explosions flames flocks animals some panning shots high-frequency detail leads quality decreases increases variable bitrate encoding theory video data may be represented series still image frames sequence frames contains spatial temporal redundancy that video compression algorithms attempt eliminate code smaller size similarities can be encoded by only storing differences between frames by using perceptual features human vision for example small differences color are more difficult perceive than are changes brightness compression algorithms can average color across these similar areas reduce space manner similar those used jpeg image compression some these methods are inherently lossy while others may preserve all relevant information from original uncompressed video one most powerful techniques for compressing video interframe compression interframe compression uses one more earlier later frames sequence compress current frame while intraframe compression uses only current frame effectively being image compression most powerful used method works by comparing each frame video with previous one if frame contains areas where nothing has moved system simply issues short command that copies that part previous frame bit-for-bit into next one if sections frame move simple manner compressor emits slightly longer command that tells decompressor shift rotate lighten darken copy this longer command still remains much shorter than intraframe compression interframe compression works well for programs that will simply be played back by viewer but can cause problems if video sequence needs be edited because interframe compression copies data from one frame another if original frame simply cut out lost transmission following frames cannot be reconstructed properly some video formats such dv compress each frame independently using intraframe compression making 'cuts' intraframe-compressed video almost easy editing uncompressed video one finds beginning ending each frame simply copies bit-for-bit each frame that one wants keep discards frames one doesn't want another difference between intraframe interframe compression that with intraframe systems each frame uses similar amount data most interframe systems certain frames such i frames mpeg-2 aren't allowed copy data from other frames so they require much more data than other frames nearby possible build computer-based video editor that spots problems caused when i frames are edited out while other frames need them this has allowed newer formats like hdv be used for editing however this process demands lot more computing power than editing intraframe compressed video with same picture quality today nearly all commonly used video compression methods eg those standards approved by itu-t iso apply discrete cosine transform dct for spatial redundancy reduction dct that widely used this regard was introduced by n ahmed t natarajan k r rao other methods such fractal compression matching pursuit use discrete wavelet transform dwt have been subject some research but are typically not used practical products except for use wavelet coding still-image coders without motion compensation
