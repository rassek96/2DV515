semantics there are thousands programming languages new ones are created every year few languages ever become sufficiently popular that they are used by more than few people but professional programmers may use dozens languages career most programming languages are not standardized by international national standard even widely used ones such perl but unrelated pearl has german standard

article comparison programming languages by type system failsafe i/o system calls most programming languages will print error message and/or throw exception if input/output operation other system call eg chmod kill fails unless programmer has explicitly arranged for different handling these events thus these languages fail safely this regard some mostly older languages require that programmer explicitly add checks for these kinds errors psychologically different cognitive biases eg optimism bias may affect novice experts alike these omissions can lead erroneous behavior language failsafe
