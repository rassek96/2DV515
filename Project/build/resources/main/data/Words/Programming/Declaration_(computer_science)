declaration computer programming from wikipedia free encyclopedia   redirected from declaration computer science jump navigation search this article may require cleanup meet wikipedia's quality standards specific problem too many examples unclear relevancy not enough references problematic mentions header files multiple declarations please help improve this article if you can december learn how when remove this template message computer programming declaration specifies properties identifier declares what word identifier means declarations are most commonly used for functions variables constants classes but can also be used for other entities such enumerations type definitions beyond name identifier itself kind entity function variable etc declarations typically specify data type for variables constants type signature for functions types may also include dimensions such for arrays declaration used announce existence entity compiler this important those strongly typed languages that require functions variables constants their types be specified with declaration before use used forward declaration term declaration frequently contrasted with term definition but meaning usage varies significantly between languages see below declarations are particularly prominent languages algol tradition including bcpl family most prominently c c++ also pascal java uses term declaration though java does not have separate declarations definitions contents declaration vs definition declarations definitions undefined variables see also notes references external links declaration vs definition basic dichotomy whether declaration contains definition not for example whether declaration constant variable specifies value constant respectively initial value variable only its type similarly whether declaration function specifies body implementation function only its type signature not all languages make this distinction many languages declarations always include definition may be referred either declarations definitions depending on language however these concepts are distinguished languages that require declaration before use for which forward declarations are used languages where interface implementation are separated interface contains declarations implementation contains definitions informal usage declaration refers only pure declaration types only no value body while definition refers declaration that includes value body however formal usage language specifications declaration includes both these senses with finer distinctions by language c c++ declaration function that does not include body called function prototype while declaration function that does include body called function definition by contrast java declarations always include body word definition has no technical meaning java declarations definitions c-family programming languages declarations are often collected into header files which are included other source files that reference use these declarations but don't have access definition information header file provides interface between code that uses declaration that which defines form information hiding declaration often used order access functions variables defined different source files library mismatch between definition type declaration type generates compiler error for variables definitions assign values area memory that was reserved during declaration phase for functions definitions supply function body while variable function may be declared many times typically defined once c++ this known one definition rule odr dynamic languages such javascript python generally allow functions be redefined that re-bound function variable much like any other with name value definition here are some examples declarations that are not definitions c extern char example1 extern int example2 void example3void here are some examples declarations that are definitions again c char example1 / outside function definition will be initialized zero / int example2 = void example3void { / definition between braces / } undefined variables main article undefined variable some programming languages implicit declaration provided first time such variable encountered at compile time other languages such usage considered be error which may resulting diagnostic message some languages have started out with implicit declaration behavior but they matured they provided option disable eg perl's use strict visual basic's option explicit see also function prototype scope programming notes for example java uses declaration class declaration method declaration while python uses definition class definition function definition this distinction observed pascal units modules conventional c c++ code organization which has header files consisting largely pure declarations source files consisting definitions though this not always strictly observed nor enforced by language references b c d declaration specifies interpretation attributes set identifiers definition identifier declaration for that identifier that o for object causes storage be reserved for that object o for function
