smaller purposes laud also made progress with internal organization press besides establishing system delegates he created wide-ranging supervisory post architypographus academic who would have

despite his education at balliol background london publishing gell found operations press incomprehensible delegates began work around him university finally dismissed gell assistant secretary charles cannan took over with little fuss even less affection for his predecessor gell was always here but i cannot make out what he did cannan had little opportunity for public wit his new role acutely gifted classicist he came head business that was successful traditional terms but now moved into uncharted terrain by themselves specialist academic works undependable bible trade could not meet rising costs dictionary press contributions university chest meet these demands oup needed much more revenue cannan set out obtain outflanking university politics inertia he made frowde london office financial engine for whole business frowde steered oxford rapidly into popular literature acquiring world's classics same year saw him enter into so-called joint venture with hodder & stoughton help

had employees eligible join including apprentices finally hart's general interest printing led him cataloguing fell types then using them series tudor stuart facsimile volumes for press before ill health led his death by then oup had moved from being parochial printer into wide-ranging university-owned publishing house with growing international presence london business frowde had no doubt that press's business london could be very largely increased was appointed on contract with commission on sales seven years later publisher university frowde was using his own name imprint well 'oxford university press' this style persisted till recent times with two kinds imprints emanating from press's london offices last man known 'publisher university' was john gilbert newton brown known his colleagues 'bruno' distinctions implied by imprints were subtle but important books that london issued on commission paid for by their authors by some learned body were styled 'henry frowde' 'humphrey milford' with no mention oup if publisher were issuing them himself while books that publisher issued under rubric university bore imprint 'oxford university press' both these categories were mostly handled by london while oxford practice secretary looked after clarendon press books commission books were intended cash cows fund london business's overheads since press did not lay aside any resources for this purpose nevertheless frowde was especially careful see that all commission books he published met with delegates' approval this was not uncommon arrangement for scholarly antiquarian presses price quickly primed frowde for imminent publication jointly with cambridge university press revised version bible which promised be 'bestseller' on scale that would require employment all press's resources keep up with demand this was be complete retranslation text bible from oldest original greek hebrew versions superseding authorized version frowde's agency was set up just time for revised version published on may sold million copies before publication at breakneck rate thenceforth though overproduction ultimately made dent profits though frowde was by no means oxford man had no social pretensions being one he was sound businessman who was able strike magic balance between caution enterprise from quite early on he had ideas advancing press's overseas trade at first europe increasingly america canada india africa he was more less singlehandedly responsible for setting up american branch well depots edinburgh toronto melbourne frowde dealt with most logistics for books carrying oup imprint including handling authors binding dispatching advertising only editorial work printing itself were carried out at supervised from oxford frowde regularly remitted money back oxford but he privately felt that business was undercapitalized would pretty soon become serious drain on university's resources unless put on sound commercial footing he himself was authorized invest money up limit business but was prevented from doing so by family troubles hence his interest overseas sales for by 1880s 1890s there was money be made india while european book market was doldrums but frowde's distance from press's decision-making meant he was incapable influencing policy unless delegate spoke for him most time frowde did whatever he could within mandate given him by delegates when applying for pension he wrote j r magrath then vice chancellor that during seven years when he had served manager bible warehouse sales london business had averaged about £20000 profits £1887 per year by under his management publisher sales had risen upwards £200000 per year profits that years service averaged £8242 per year conflict over secretaryship price trying his own way modernize press against resistance its own historical inertia had become overworked by was so exhausted want retire benjamin jowett had become vice chancellor university impatient endless committees that would no doubt attend appointment successor price jowett extracted what could be interpreted permission from delegates headhunted philip lyttelton gell former student acolyte his be next secretary delegates gell was making name for himself at publishing firm cassell petter galpin firm regarded scandalously commercial by delegates gell himself was patrician who was unhappy with his work where he saw himself catering taste one class lower middle he grasped at chance working with kind texts readerships oup attracted jowett promised gell golden opportunities little which he actually had authority deliver he timed gell's appointment coincide with both long vacation from june september death mark pattison so potential opposition was prevented from attending crucial meetings jowett knew primary reason why gell would attract hostility was that he had never worked for press nor been delegate he had sullied himself city with raw commerce his fears were borne out gell immediately proposed thorough modernising press with marked lack tact earned himself enduring enemies nevertheless he was able do lot tandem with frowde expanded publishing programmes reach oup until about then his health broke down under impossible work conditions he was being forced endure by delegates' non-cooperation delegates then served him with notice termination service that violated his contract however he was persuaded not file suit go quietly delegates were not opposed primarily his initiatives but his manner executing them his lack sympathy with academic way life their view press was always would be association scholars gell's idea efficiency appeared violate that culture although subsequently very similar programme reform was put into practice from inside 20th century conference booth charles cannan who had been instrumental gell's removal succeeded gell humphrey s milford his younger colleague effectively succeeded frowde both were oxford men who knew system inside out close collaboration with which they worked was function their shared background worldview cannan was known for terrifying silences milford had uncanny ability testified by amen house employees 'disappear' room rather like cheshire cat from which obscurity he would suddenly address his subordinates make them jump whatever their reasons for their style working both cannan milford had very hardnosed view what needed be done they proceeded do indeed frowde knew within few weeks milford's entering london office that he would be replaced milford however always treated frowde with courtesy frowde remained advisory capacity till milford rapidly teamed up with j e hodder williams hodder stoughton setting up what was known joint account for issue wide range books education science

musicology had also published yattendon hymnal more significantly first edition english hymnal under editorship percy dearmer then largely unknown ralph vaughan williams sir william henry hadow's multi-volume oxford history music had appeared between such musical publishing enterprises however were rare nineteenth-century oxford idea that music might any sense be educational would not have been entertained few delegates former publishers were themselves musical had extensive music backgrounds london office however milford had musical taste had connections particularly with world church cathedral musicians milford hired hubert j foss originally assistant educational manager v h collins that work foss showed energy imagination however sutcliffe says foss modest composer gifted pianist was not particularly interested education he was passionately interested music when shortly thereafter foss brought milford scheme for publishing group essays by well-known musicians on composers whose works were frequently played on radio milford may have thought less music-related than education-related there no clear record thought process whereby press would enter into publishing music for performance foss's presence his knowledge ability enthusiasm imagination may well have been catalyst bringing hitherto unconnected activities together milford's mind another new venture similar establishment overseas branches milford may not have fully understood what he was undertaking fiftieth anniversary pamphlet published by music department says that oup had no knowledge music trade no representative sell music shops and−−it seems−−no awareness that sheet music was any way different commodity from books however intentionally intuitively milford took three steps that launched oup on major operation he bought anglo-french music company all its facilities connections resources he hired norman peterkin moderately well-known musician full-time sales manager for music he established separate division music department with its own offices amen house with foss first musical editor then other than general support milford left foss largely his own devices foss responded with incredible energy he worked establish largest possible list shortest possible time adding titles at rate over year eight years later there were titles catalogue year department's establishment foss began series inexpensive but well edited printed choral pieces under series title oxford choral songs this series under general editorship w g whittaker was oup's first commitment publishing music for performance rather than book form for study series plan was expanded by adding similarly inexpensive but high-quality oxford church music tudor church music taken over from carnegie uk trust all these series continue today scheme contributed essays foss had originally brought milford appeared heritage music two more volumes would appear over next thirty years percy scholes's listener's guide music originally published was similarly brought into new department first series books on music appreciation for listening public scholes's continuing work for oup designed match growth broadcast recorded music plus his other work journalistic music criticism would be later comprehensively organized summarized oxford companion music perhaps most importantly foss seemed have knack for finding new composers what he regarded distinctively english music which had broad appeal public this concentration provided oup two mutually reinforcing benefits niche music publishing unoccupied by potential competitors branch music performance composition that english themselves had largely neglected hinnells proposes that early music department's mixture scholarship cultural nationalism area music with largely unknown commercial prospects was driven by its sense cultural philanthropy given press's academic background desire promote national music outside german mainstream consequence foss actively promoted performance sought publication music by ralph vaughan williams william walton constant lambert alan rawsthorne peter warlock philip heseltine edmund rubbra other english composers what press called most durable gentleman's agreement history modern music foss guaranteed publication any music that vaughan williams would care offer them addition foss worked secure oup's rights not only music publication live performance but mechanical rights recording broadcast was not at all clear at time how significant these would become indeed foss oup number composers at first declined join support performing right society fearing that its fees would discourage performance new media later years would show that contrary these forms music would prove more lucrative than traditional venues music publishing whatever music department's growth quantity breadth musical offering reputation amongst both musicians general public whole question financial return came head 1930s milford london publisher had fully supported music department during its years formation growth however he came under increasing pressure from delegates oxford concerning continued flow expenditures from what seemed them unprofitable venture their mind operations at amen house were supposed be both academically respectable financially remunerative london office existed make money for clarendon press spend on promotion learning further oup treated its book publications short-term projects any books that did not sell within few years publication were written off show unplanned hidden income if fact they sold thereafter contrast music department's emphasis on music for performance was comparatively long-term continuing particularly income from recurring broadcasts recordings came continued build its relationships with new upcoming musicians delegates were not comfortable with foss's viewpoint i still think this word 'loss' misnomer not really capital invested wrote foss milford thus was not until that music department showed its first profitable year by then economic pressures depression well in-house pressure reduce expenditures possibly academic background parent body oxford combined make oup's primary musical business that publishing works intended for formal musical education for music appreciation−−again influence broadcast recording this matched well with increased demand for materials support music education british schools result governmental reforms education during 1930s press did not cease search out publish new musicians their music but tenor business had changed
