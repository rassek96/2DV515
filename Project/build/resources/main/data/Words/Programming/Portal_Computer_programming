type expression was introduced c++11 its primary intended use generic programming where often difficult even impossible express types that depend on template parameters generic programming techniques became increasingly popular throughout 1990s need for type-deduction mechanism was recognized many compiler vendors implemented their own versions operator typically called typeof some portable implementations with limited functionality based on existing language features were developed bjarne stroustrup proposed that standardized version operator be added c++ language suggested name

processed by machine such she sometimes considered world's first computer programmer she was only legitimate child poet lord byron with anne isabella milbanke she had no relationship with her father who died when she was nine young adult she took interest mathematics particular babbage's work on analytical engine between she translated article by italian mathematician luigi menabrea on engine which she supplemented with set notes her own these notes contain what considered first computer program—that algorithm encoded for processing by machine though babbage's engine has never been built lovelace's notes are important early history computers she also foresaw capability computers go beyond mere calculating number-crunching while others including babbage himself focused only on these
