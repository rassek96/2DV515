actions on executing machine those actions produce effects according semantics instructions program programs for computer may execute batch process without human interaction user may type commands interactive session interpreter this case commands are simply programs whose execution chained together term run used almost synonymously related meaning both run execute refers specific action user starting launching invoking program please run application contents context execution process interpreter see also context execution context which execution takes place crucial very few programs execute on bare machine programs usually contain implicit explicit assumptions about resources available at time execution most programs execute with support operating system run-time libraries specific source language that provide crucial services not supplied directly by computer itself this supportive environment for instance usually decouples program from direct manipulation computer peripherals providing more general abstract services instead process further information program lifecycle phase prior execution program must first be written this generally done source code which then compiled at compile time statically linked at link time executable this executable then invoked most often by operating system which loads program into memory load time possibly performs dynamic linking then begins execution by moving control entry point program all these steps depend on application binary interface operating system at this point execution begins program enters run time program then runs until ends either normal termination crash interpreter system that executes program called interpreter program loosely speaking interpreter actually does what program says do this contrasts with language translator that converts program from one language another most common language translators are compilers translators typically convert their source from high-level human readable language into lower-level language sometimes low native machine code that simpler faster for processor directly execute idea that ratio executions translations program will be large that program need only be compiled once can be run any number times this can provide large benefit for translation versus direct interpretation source language one trade-off that development time increased because compilation some cases only changed files must be recompiled then executable needs be relinked for some changes executable must be rebuilt from scratch computers compilers become faster this fact becomes less obstacle also speed end product typically more important user than development time translators usually produce abstract result that not completely ready execute frequently operating system will convert translator's object code into final executable form just before execution program begins see also executable run-time system runtime program phase retrieved from
