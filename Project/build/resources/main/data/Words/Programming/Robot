utilization robots by modularizing their architecture functionality effectiveness modular robot easier increase compared conventional robots these robots are composed single type identical several different identical module types similarly shaped modules which vary size their architectural structure allows hyper-redundancy for modular robots they can be designed with more than degrees freedom dof creating programming inverse kinematics dynamics for modular robots more complex than with traditional robots modular robots may be composed l-shaped modules cubic modules u h-shaped modules anat technology early modular robotic technology patented by robotics design inc allows creation modular robots from u h shaped modules that connect chain are used form heterogeneous homogenous modular robot systems these “anat robots” can be designed with “n” dof each module complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively modules connected before after its chain therefore single module allows one degree freedom more modules that are connected one another more degrees freedom will have l-shaped modules can also be designed chain must become increasingly smaller size chain increases payloads attached end chain place greater strain on modules that are further from base anat h-shaped modules do not suffer from this problem their design allows modular robot distribute pressure impacts evenly amongst other attached modules therefore payload-carrying capacity does not decrease length arm increases modular robots can be manually self-reconfigured form different robot that may perform different applications because modular robots same architecture type are composed modules that compose different modular robots snake-arm robot can combine with another form dual quadra-arm robot can split into several mobile robots mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones combine with others into larger different one this allows single modular robot ability be fully specialized single task well capacity be specialized perform multiple different tasks modular robotic technology currently being applied hybrid transportation industrial automation duct cleaning

comforting some people disturbing others robots have become more advanced sophisticated experts academics have increasingly explored questions what ethics might govern robots' behavior whether robots might be able claim any kind social cultural ethical legal rights one scientific team has said that possible that robot brain will exist by others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by recent advances have made robotic behavior more sophisticated social impact intelligent robots subject documentary film called plug & pray vernor vinge has suggested that moment may come when computers robots are smarter than humans he calls this singularity he suggests that may be somewhat possibly very dangerous for humans this discussed by philosophy called singularitarianism experts attended conference hosted by association for advancement artificial intelligence aaai discuss whether computers robots might be able acquire any autonomy how much these abilities might pose threat hazard they noted that some robots have acquired various forms semi-autonomy including being able find power sources on their own being able independently choose targets attack with weapons they also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination have achieved cockroach intelligence they noted that self-awareness depicted science-fiction probably unlikely but that there were other potential hazards pitfalls various media sources scientific groups have noted separate trends differing areas which might together result greater robotic functionalities autonomy which pose some inherent concerns nao alderen robots were shown have capability for degree self-awareness researchers at rensselaer polytechnic institute ai reasoning lab new york conducted experiment where robot became aware itself corrected its answer question once had realised this military robots some experts academics have questioned use robots for military combat especially when such robots are given some degree autonomous functions there are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots be controlled mainly by other robots us navy has funded report which indicates that military robots become more complex there should be greater attention implications their ability make autonomous decisions one researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane they could make decisions more effectively however other experts question this one robot particular eatr has generated public concerns over its fuel source can continually refuel itself using organic substances although engine for eatr designed run on biomass vegetation specifically selected by its sensors which can find on battlefields other local environments project has stated that chicken fat can also be used manuel de landa has noted that smart missiles autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots they make some their decisions autonomously he believes this represents important dangerous trend which humans are handing over important decisions machines relationship unemployment main article technological unemployment for centuries experts have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete increase unemployment recent example human replacement involves taiwanese technology company foxconn who july announced three-year plan replace workers with more robots at present company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them million robots over three-year period lawyers have speculated that increased prevalence robots workplace could lead need revise redundancy laws contemporary uses general-purpose robot acts guide during day security guard at night see also list robots at present there are two main types robots based on their use general-purpose autonomous robots dedicated robots robots can be classified by their specificity purpose robot might be designed perform one particular task extremely well range tasks less well course all robots by their nature can be re-programmed behave differently but some are limited by their physical form for example factory robot arm can perform jobs such cutting welding gluing acting fairground ride while pick-and-place robot can only populate printed circuit boards general-purpose autonomous robots main article autonomous robot general-purpose autonomous robots can perform variety functions independently general-purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently known spaces handle their own re-charging needs interface with electronic doors elevators perform other basic tasks like computers general-purpose robots can link with networks software accessories that increase their usefulness they may recognize people objects talk provide companionship monitor environmental quality respond alarms pick up supplies perform other useful tasks general-purpose robots may perform variety functions simultaneously they may take on different roles at different times day some such robots try mimic human beings may even resemble people appearance this type robot called humanoid robot humanoid robots are still very limited stage no humanoid robot can yet actually navigate around room that has never been thus humanoid robots are really quite limited despite their intelligent behaviors their well-known environments factory robots car production over last three decades automobile factories have become dominated by robots typical factory contains hundreds industrial robots working on fully automated production lines with one robot for every ten human workers on automated production line vehicle chassis on conveyor welded glued painted finally assembled at sequence robot stations packaging industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing packaging manufactured goods for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from end conveyor belt placing them into boxes for loading unloading machining centers electronics mass-produced printed circuit boards pcbs are almost exclusively manufactured by pick-and-place robots typically with scara manipulators which remove tiny electronic components from strips trays place them on pcbs with great accuracy

probably best remembered for his science-fiction stories especially those about robots where he placed robots their interaction with society at center many his works asimov carefully considered problem ideal set instructions robots might be given order lower risk humans arrived at his three laws robotics robot may not injure human being through inaction allow human being come harm robot must obey orders given by human beings except where such orders would conflict with first law robot must protect its own existence long such protection does not conflict with first second law these were introduced his short story runaround although foreshadowed few earlier stories later asimov added zeroth law robot may not harm humanity by inaction allow humanity come harm rest laws are modified
