nonstop os type event-driven networking license mit website nodejsorg nodejs open-source cross-platform javascript runtime environment for developing diverse variety tools applications although nodejs not javascript framework many its basic modules are written javascript developers can write new modules javascript runtime environment interprets javascript using google's v8 javascript engine nodejs has event-driven architecture capable asynchronous i/o these design choices aim optimize throughput scalability web applications with many input/output operations well for real-time web applications

nodejs nodejs was originally written by ryan dahl initial release supported only linux its development maintenance was led by dahl later sponsored by joyent dahl was inspired create nodejs after seeing file upload progress bar on flickr browser did not know how much file had been uploaded had query web server dahl desired easier way dahl demonstrated project at inaugural european jsconf on november nodejs combined google's v8 javascript engine event loop low-level i/o api project received standing ovation january package manager was introduced for nodejs environment called npm package manager makes easier for programmers publish share source code nodejs libraries designed simplify installation updating uninstallation libraries june microsoft joyent implemented native windows version nodejs first nodejs build supporting windows was released july january dahl stepped aside promoting coworker npm creator isaac schlueter manage project january schlueter announced that timothy j fontaine would lead project december fedor indutny started iojs fork nodejs due internal conflict over joyent's governance iojs was created open governance alternative with separate technical committee unlike nodejs authors planned keep iojs up-to-date with latest releases google v8 javascript engine february intent form neutral nodejs foundation was announced by june nodejs iojs communities voted work together under nodejs foundation september nodejs v012 iojs v33 were merged back together into node v40 this brought v8 es6 features into nodejs long-term support release cycle iojs website recommends that developers switch back nodejs that no further releases are planned due merger overview nodejs allows creation web servers networking tools using javascript collection modules that handle various core functionality modules are provided for file system i/o networking dns http tcp tls/ssl udp binary data buffers cryptography functions data streams other core functions nodejs's modules use api designed reduce complexity writing server applications nodejs applications can run on mac os x microsoft windows nonstop unix servers they can alternatively be written with coffeescript javascript alternative dart microsoft typescript strongly typed forms javascript any other language that can compile javascript nodejs primarily used build network programs such web servers making similar php biggest difference between nodejs php that most functions php block until completion commands execute only after previous commands have completed while functions nodejs are designed be non-blocking commands execute parallel use callbacks signal completion failure platform architecture nodejs brings event-driven programming web servers enabling development fast web servers javascript developers can create highly scalable servers without using threading by using simplified model event-driven programming that uses callbacks signal completion task nodejs was created because concurrency difficult many server-side programming languages often leads poor performance nodejs connects ease scripting language javascript with power unix network programming nodejs was built on google v8 javascript engine since was open-source under bsd license extremely fast proficient with internet fundamentals like http dns tcp also javascript was well-known language making nodejs immediately accessible entire web development community industry support programmers have built thousands open-source libraries for nodejs - most them hosted on npm website nodejs developer community has two main mailing lists irc channel nodejs on freenode there annual nodejs developer conference called nodeconf open-source community has developed server frameworks accelerate development applications such frameworks include connect expressjs socketio koajs hapijs sailsjs meteor derby many others modern desktop ides provide editing debugging features specifically for nodejs applications such ides include atom brackets jetbrains webstorm microsoft visual studio with nodejs tools for visual studio typescript with node definitions netbeans nodeclipse enide studio eclipse-based visual studio code certain online web-based ides also support nodejs such codeanywhere codenvy cloud9 ide koding technical details this section may be too technical for most readers understand please help improve this section make understandable non-experts without removing technical details talk page may contain suggestions august learn how when remove this template message nodejs javascript runtime environment that processes incoming requests loop called event loop threading nodejs operates on single thread using non-blocking i/o calls allowing support tens thousands concurrent connections without incurring cost thread context switching design sharing single thread between all requests that uses observer pattern intended for building highly concurrent applications where any function performing i/o must use callback order accommodate single-threaded event loop nodejs utilizes libuv library that turn uses fixed-sized threadpool that responsible for some non-blocking asynchronous i/o operations downside this single-threaded approach that nodejs doesn't allow vertical scaling by increasing number cpu cores machine running on without using additional module such cluster strongloop process manager pm2 however developers can increase default number threads libuv threadpool these threads are likely be distributed across multiple cores by server operating system execution parallel tasks nodejs handled by thread pool main thread call functions post tasks shared task queue that threads thread pool pull execute inherently non-blocking system functions like networking translates kernel-side non-blocking sockets while inherently blocking system functions like file i/o run blocking way on its own thread when thread thread pool completes task informs main thread this that turn wakes up execute registered callback since callbacks are handled serial on main thread long lasting computations other cpu-bound tasks will freeze entire event-loop until completion v8 v8 javascript execution engine built for google chrome open-sourced by google written c++ v8 compiles javascript source code native machine code instead interpreting real time nodejs uses libuv handle asynchronous events libuv abstraction layer for network file system functionality on both windows posix -based systems like linux mac os x oss on nonstop unix core functionality nodejs resides javascript library nodejs bindings written c++ connect these technologies each other operating system package management npm pre-installed package manager for nodejs server platform used install nodejs programs from npm registry organizing installation management third-party nodejs programs npm not be confused with commonjs require statement not used load code instead used install code manage code dependencies from command line packages found npm registry can range from simple helper libraries like underscorejs task runners like grunt unified api nodejs can be combined with browser database supporting json data such postgres mongodb couchdb json for unified javascript development stack with adaptation what were essentially server-side development patterns like mvc mvp mvvm etc nodejs allows reuse same model service interface between client-side server-side event loop nodejs registers itself with operating system so that notified when connection made operating system will issue callback within nodejs runtime each connection small heap allocation traditionally relatively heavyweight os processes threads handled each connection nodejs uses event loop for scalability instead processes threads contrast other event-driven servers nodejs's event loop does not need be called explicitly instead callbacks are defined server automatically enters event loop at end callback definition nodejs exits event loop when there are no further callbacks be performed alternatives jxcore jxcore fork nodejs targeting mobile devices iots its first beta was released january was open sourced on february made available through github repository jxcore can use either google v8 mozilla spidermonkey javascript engines result jxcore can run node applications on ios devices using spidermonkey march active development on jxcore has been halted other languages similar open source event-driven server frameworks for other platforms include eventmachine for ruby libevent for c perl object environment for perl twisted for python vertx for java javascript groovy ruby python scala clojure ceylon nodejs may utilize code written other programming languages using edgejs allows microsoft net applications run nodejs scripts in-process allows nodejs servers utilize net compiled code via async callbacks luvit implements nodejs apis for
