type word processor speedscript word processor for various 8-bit home computers was originally printed type-in machine language listing issues compute compute's gazette magazines approximately kb length provided many same features commercial word processing packages early 8-bit era such paperclip bank street writer contents versions 80-column updates utilities reception gallery references versions april compute published scriptor word processor written by staff writer charles brannon basic assembly language type-in program for atari 8-bit family january version his new word processor speedscript appeared compute's gazette for commodore vic-20 appeared compute's second book commodore on gazette disk may compute march april corrections that updated appeared may full version appeared book published by compute speedscript word processor for commodore vic-20 update appeared december compute january compute disk again later may compute's gazette issue with three additional utilities speedscript was later ported atari apple ii family compute may june respectively speedscript was written entirely assembly language compute publications later released book/disk combinations that contained complete commented source code well machine language mlx format for each platform version speedscript for ms-dos was created by randy thompson published book form by compute books this version was written turbo pascal with portions written assembly language added incremental new features word processor such additional printer commands full cursor-control take advantage pc's home end pgup pgdn keys native 80-column mode 80-column updates original versions speedscript were designed for 40-column commodore 22-column vic-20 when commodore was released featuring 80-column display many users requested updated version speedscript take advantage this new capability june compute's gazette published speedscript-80 short patch for speedscript higher which enabled use vdc's new 80-column capabilities on commodore running mode however this did not take advantage c128's expanded memory few minor commands were eliminated due alterations existing code speedscript-80 was enhanced soon after with speedscript-80 revisited by bob kodadek speedscript native version for c128 called speedscript also written by kodadek was finally released october this version eliminated problems patch took full advantage c128's 80-column screen its expanded memory enhanced keyboard later update appeared september adding full text justification tab setting online help december compute's gazette published instant utility for c64 version speedscript that allowed 80-column document previewing though not editing on standard c64 this was done by using half-width characters on high-resolution graphics screen utilities although speedscript did not include built-in spell checker additional utilities were soon published december speedcheck was published compute's gazette this external utility accepted speedscript files well those from compatible word processors such paperclip spell-checked them against user-defined dictionary enhanced 80-column version for c128 speedcheck was published september another utility scriptsave was developed provide automatic saving functionality commodore version speedscript this program would set up timer program save documents disk before loading running speedscript itself several additional utilities were published may issue compute's gazette along with speedscript scriptread was developed identify preview speedscript documents on disk with ability scratch any files no longer needed this was important addition on single-drive system there would be no way save work if disk became full speedsearch provided full-text search all speedscript documents on disk returning count how many times searched word phrase was used each document date time stamper introduces program disk drive that adds time stamps files on disk then executes speedscript reception review four word processors transactor may praised speedscript extremely sophisticated citing its large text buffer logical cursor navigation undo command while criticizing its lack right justification magazine concluded that speedscript was not only easy winner among budget-priced word processors but also serious contender even when compared with higher priced programs speedscript was sufficiently popular receive coverage reference works such wordprocessing reference guide karl hildon's popular inner space anthology mitchell waite's official book for commodore
