august sebastian rachel scheidermantel mauchly cincinnati ohio he moved with his parents sister helen elizabeth betty at early age chevy chase maryland when sebastian mauchly obtained position at carnegie institute washington head its section terrestrial electricity youth mauchly was interested science particular with electricity was known fix neighbors' electric systems at age mauchly attended ev brown elementary school chevy chase mckinley technical high school washington dc at mckinley mauchly was extremely active debate team was member national honor society became editor-in-chief school's newspaper tech life after graduating from high school he earned scholarship study engineering at johns hopkins university he subsequently transferred physics department without completing his undergraduate degree instead earned phd physics from mauchly served research assistant at johns hopkins university where he concentrated on calculating energy levels formaldehyde spectrum mauchly's teaching career truly began at ursinus college where he was appointed head physics department where he was fact only staff member summer mauchly took defense training course for electronics at university pennsylvania moore school electrical engineering there he met lab instructor j presper eckert 1919-1995 with whom he would form long-standing working partnership following course mauchly was hired instructor electrical engineering he was promoted assistant professor electrical engineering following outbreak world war ii united states army ordnance department contracted moore school build electronic computer which proposed by mauchly eckert would accelerate recomputation artillery firing tables mauchly left sperry rand started mauchly associates inc one mauchly associates' notable achievements was development critical path method cpm which provided for automated construction scheduling mauchly also set up consulting organization dynatrend worked consultant sperry univac from until his death john mauchly died on january abington pennsylvania during heart surgery following long illness his first wife mary augusta walzl mathematician whom he married on december drowned john mary mauchly had two children james jimmy sidney mauchly married kathleen kay mcnulty 1921-2006 one six original eniac programmers they had five children sara sallie kathleen kathy john virginia gini eva moore school dr mauchly took course wartime electronics at moore school electrical engineering part university pennsylvania there he met j presper eckert recent moore school graduate mauchly accepted teaching position at moore school which was center for wartime computing eckert encouraged mauchly believe that vacuum tubes could be made reliable with proper engineering practices critical problem that was consuming moore school was ballistics calculation firing tables for large number new guns that us army was developing for war effort eniac main article eniac mauchly wrote memo proposing building general-purpose electronic computer proposal which circulated within moore school but significance which was not immediately recognized emphasized enormous speed advantage that could be gained by using digital electronics with no moving parts lieutenant herman goldstine who was liaison between united states army moore school picked up on idea asked mauchly write formal proposal april army contracted with moore school build electronic numerical integrator computer eniac mauchly led conceptual design while eckert led hardware engineering on eniac number other talented engineers contributed confidential project px because its high-speed calculations eniac could solve problems that were previously unsolvable was roughly thousand times faster than existing technology could add numbers do 10-digit multiplications one second eniac could be programmed perform sequences loops addition subtraction multiplication division square-root input/output functions conditional branches programming was initially accomplished with patch cords switches reprogramming took days was redesigned allow use stored programs with some loss speed for his work on eniac he was inducted posthumously into national inventors hall fame edvac eniac design was frozen allow construction eckert mauchly were already aware limitations machine began plans on second computer be called edvac by january they had procured contract build this stored-program computer eckert had proposed mercury delay line memory store both program data later that year mathematician john von neumann learned project joined some engineering discussions he produced what was understood be internal document describing edvac term von neumann architecture arose from von neumann's paper first draft report on edvac dated june was early written account general purpose stored-program computing machine edvac goldstine move that was become controversial removed any reference eckert mauchly distributed document number von neumann's associates across country ideas became widely known within very small world computer designers besides lack credit eckert mauchly suffered additional setbacks due goldstine's actions eniac patent us patent issued was filed on june granted february but public disclosure design details edvac first draft which were also common eniac was later cited one cause for invalidation eniac patent moore school lectures main article moore school lectures march just after eniac was announced moore school decided change their patent policy order gain commercial rights any future past computer development there eckert mauchly decided this was unacceptable they resigned however they had already been contracted do one more thing at moore school give series talks on computer design course theory techniques for design digital computers ran from july august eckert gave lectures mauchly goldstine each delivered moore school lectures they came be known were attended by representatives from army navy mit national bureau standards cambridge university columbia harvard institute for advanced study ibm bell labs eastman kodak general electric national cash register number attendees were later go on develop computers such maurice wilkes cambridge who built edsac eckert-mauchly computer corporation eckert mauchly formed first computer company eckert-mauchly computer corporation emcc mauchly was president they secured contract with national bureau standards build edvac ii later named univac univac first computer designed for business applications had many significant technical advantages such magnetic tape for mass storage interim product company created delivered smaller computer binac but were still shaky financial situation they were purchased by remington rand became univac division software very early history emcc john mauchly assumed responsibility for programming coding applications for planned computer systems his early interaction with representatives census bureau discussion with people interested statistics weather prediction various business problems focused his attention on need provide new users with software accomplish their objectives he knew would be difficult sell computers without application materials without training how use systems so emcc began assemble staff mathematicians interested coding early from norberg mauchly’s interest lay application computers well their architecture organization his experience with programming eniac its successors led him create short code see univac short code first programming language actually used on computer predated by zuse’s conceptual plankalkul was pseudocode interpreter for mathematical problems proposed ran on univac i ii mauchly's belief importance languages led him hire grace murray hopper develop compiler for univac john mauchly has also been credited for being first one using verb program his paper on electronic computing although context eniac not its current meaning career dr mauchly stayed involved computers for rest his life he was founding member president association for computing machinery acm also helped found society for industrial applied mathematics siam serving its fourth president eckert-mauchly corporation was bought by remington rand for ten years dr mauchly remained director univac applications research leaving he formed mauchly associates consulting company that later introduced critical path method cpm for construction scheduling by computer he founded dynatrend computer consulting organization he became consultant sperry univac awards mauchly received numerous award honors he was life member franklin institute national academy engineering society for advancement management he was elected fellow ire predecessor society ieee was fellow american statistical association he received lld hon degree from university pennsylvania adschon degree from ursinus college he was recipient philadelphia award scott medal goode medal afips american federation information processing societies pennsylvania award emanual r piore award howard n potts medal numerous other awards

learn how when remove this template message mauchly eckert's patent on eniac was invalidated by us federal court decision october for several reasons some had do with time between publication first draft patent filing date federal judge who presided over case ruled that subject matter was derived from earlier atanasoff–berry computer abc this statement has become center controversy critics note that while court said that abc was first electronic digital computer did not define term computer had originally referred person who computes but was adapted apply machine critics court decision also note that there at component level nothing common between two machines abc was binary eniac was decimal abc used regenerative drum memory eniac used electronic decade counters abc used its tubes implement binary serial adder while eniac used tubes implement complete set decimal operations eniac's general-purpose instruction set together with ability automatically sequence through them made general-purpose computer proponents for court decision emphasize that testimony established that mauchly definitely had complete access atanasoff's machine documents describing letters he wrote atanasoff show that he was at one time at least considering building on atanasoff's approach mauchly consistently maintained that was use high-speed electronic flip-flops cosmic-ray counting devices at swarthmore college that gave him idea for computing at electronic speeds see also mauchly's sphericity test references use high-speed vacuum tube devices for calculating by john w mauchly august
