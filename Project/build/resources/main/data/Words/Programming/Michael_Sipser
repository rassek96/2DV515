theory he professor applied mathematics dean science at massachusetts institute technology contents biography scientific career notable books personal life references external links biography sipser was born raised brooklyn new york moved oswego new york when he was years old he earned his ba mathematics from cornell university his phd engineering from university california at berkeley under direction manuel blum he joined mit's laboratory for computer science research associate became mit professor following year from until he served head mit mathematics department he was appointed dean mit school science he fellow american academy arts sciences he was elected fellow american mathematical society for contributions complexity theory for leadership service mathematical community scientific career sipser specializes algorithms complexity theory specifically efficient error correcting codes interactive proof systems randomness quantum computation establishing inherent computational difficulty problems he introduced method probabilistic restriction for proving super-polynomial lower bounds on circuit complexity paper joint with merrick furst james saxe their result was later improved be exponential lower bound by andrew yao johan håstad early derandomization theorem sipser showed that bpp contained polynomial hierarchy subsequently improved by peter gács clemens lautemann form what now known sipser-gàcs-lautemann theorem sipser also established connection between expander graphs derandomization he his phd student daniel spielman introduced expander codes application expander graphs with fellow graduate student david lichtenstein sipser proved that go pspace hard quantum computation theory he introduced adiabatic algorithm jointly with edward farhi jeffrey goldstone samuel gutmann sipser has long been interested p versus np problem he wagered ounce gold with leonard adleman that problem would be solved with proof that p≠np by end 20th century sipser sent adleman american gold eagle coin because problem remained remains unsolved notable books sipser author introduction theory computation textbook for theoretical computer science personal life sipser lives cambridge massachusetts with his wife ina has two children daughter rachel who graduated from new york university younger son aaron who undergraduate at mit references b trafton anne
