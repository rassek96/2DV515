jacquard loom from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search has been suggested that this article be merged with jacquard weaving discuss proposed since july jacquard looms masson mill this portrait jacquard was woven silk on jacquard loom required punched cards create was only produced order charles babbage owned one these portraits inspired him using perforated cards his analytical engine collection science museum london england jacquard loom power loom invented by joseph marie jacquard first demonstrated that simplifies process manufacturing textiles with such complex patterns brocade damask matelassé loom was controlled by chain cards number punched cards laced together into continuous sequence multiple rows holes were punched on each card with one complete card corresponding one row design several such paper cards generally white color can be seen images below chains like bouchon's earlier use paper tape allowed sequences any length be constructed not limited by size card based on earlier inventions by frenchmen basile bouchon jean baptiste falcon jacques vaucanson static display jacquard loom centrepiece musée des tissus et des arts décoratifs lyon live displays jacquard loom are available at few private museums around lyon also twice day at la maison des canuts well at other locations around world contents principles operation importance computing examples see also references sources principles operation each position card corresponds bolus hook which can either be raised stopped dependent on whether hole punched out card card solid hook raises lowers harness which carries guides warp thread so that weft will either lie above below sequence raised lowered threads what creates pattern each hook can be connected number threads allowing more than one repeat pattern loom with hook head might have four threads connected each hook resulting fabric that warp ends wide with four repeats weave going across term jacquard loom somewhat inaccurate jacquard head that adapts great many dobby looms that allow weaving machine then create intricate patterns often seen jacquard weaving jacquard looms whilst relatively common textile industry are not ubiquitous dobby looms which are usually faster much cheaper operate however unlike jacquard looms they are not capable producing so many different weaves from one warp modern jacquard looms are controlled by computers place original punched cards can have thousands hooks threading jacquard loom so labor-intensive that many looms are threaded only once subsequent warps are then tied existing warp with help knotting robot which ties each new thread on individually even for small loom with only few thousand warp ends process re-threading can take days 19th century jacquard loom importance computing jacquard head used replaceable punched cards control sequence operations considered important step history computing hardware ability change pattern loom's weave by simply changing cards was important conceptual precursor development computer programming data entry charles babbage knew jacquard looms planned use cards store programs his analytical engine late 19th century herman hollerith took idea using punched cards store information step further when he created punched card tabulating machine which he used input data for us census large punched-card-based data processing industry developed first half twentieth century dominated by international business machine corporation ibm with its line unit record equipment cards were used for data however with programming done by plugboards some early computers such ibm automatic sequence controlled calculator harvard mark i received program instructions from paper tape punched with holes similar jacquard's string cards later computers executed programs from higher-speed memory though cards were commonly used load programs into memory punched cards remained use computing up until mid 1980s examples austrian jacquard handloom end 19th century national museum textile industry sliven bulgaria close-up view comber board harness mails weights lingoes warp with ends punched cards use
