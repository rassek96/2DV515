directory listing computing directory file system cataloging structure which contains references other computer files possibly other directories on many computers directories are known folders drawers provide some relevancy workbench traditional office file cabinet files are organized by storing related files same directory hierarchical filesystem that one which files directories are organized manner that resembles tree directory contained inside another directory called subdirectory terms parent child are often used describe relationship between subdirectory directory which cataloged latter being parent top-most directory such filesystem which does not have parent its own called root directory contents overview o folder metaphor lookup cache see also references external links overview diagram hierarchal directory tree root directory here called 'mfd' for master file directory historically even on some modern embedded systems file systems either had no support for directories at all only had flat directory structure meaning subdirectories were not supported there were only group top-level directories each containing files modern systems directory can contain mix files subdirectories most modern unix-like systems especially linux have standard directory structure defined by filesystem hierarchy standard reference location directory system called path many operating systems programs have associated working directory which they execute typically file names accessed by program are assumed reside within this directory if file names are not specified with explicit directory name some operating systems restrict user's access only their home directory project directory thus isolating their activities from all other users early versions unix root directory was home directory root user but modern unix usually uses another directory such /root for this purpose keeping with unix philosophy unix systems treat directories type file folder metaphor sample folder icon from kde name folder presenting analogy file folder used offices used hierarchical file system design for electronic recording machine accounting erma mark published well by xerox star used almost all modern operating systems' desktop environments folders are often depicted with icons which visually resemble physical file folders there difference between directory which file system concept graphical user interface metaphor that used represent folder for example microsoft windows uses concept special folders help present contents computer user fairly consistent way that frees user from having deal with absolute directory paths which can vary between versions windows between individual installations many operating systems also have concept smart folders that reflect results file system search other operation these folders do not represent directory file hierarchy many email clients allow creation folders organize email these folders have no corresponding representation filesystem structure if one referring container documents term folder more appropriate term directory refers way structured list document files folders stored on computer distinction can be due way directory accessed on unix systems /usr/bin/ usually referred directory when viewed command line console but if accessed through graphical file manager users may sometimes call folder lookup cache ] this section needs expansion you can help by adding december operating systems that support hierarchical filesystems practically all modern ones implement form caching ram recent path lookups unix world this usually called directory name lookup cache dnlc although called dcache on linux for local filesystems dnlc entries normally expire only under pressure from other more recent entries for network file systems coherence mechanism necessary ensure that entries have not been invalidated by other clients see also concepts directory structure filename home directory root
