end-of-file marker after last line text file such markers were required under cp/m ms-dos operating systems on modern operating systems such windows linux text files do not contain any special eof character text file refers type container while plain text refers type content text files can contain plain text but they are not limited such at generic level description there are two kinds computer

stylized iconic depiction csv-formatted text file because their simplicity text files are commonly used for storage information they avoid some problems encountered with other file formats such endianness padding bytes differences number bytes machine word further when data corruption occurs text file often easier recover continue processing remaining contents disadvantage text files that they usually have low entropy meaning that information occupies more storage than strictly necessary simple text file needs no additional metadata assist reader interpretation therefore may contain no data at all which case zero byte file encoding ascii character set most common format for english-language text files generally assumed be default file format many situations for accented other non-ascii characters necessary choose character encoding many systems this chosen on basis default locale setting on computer read on common character encodings include iso 8859-1 for many european languages because many encodings have only limited repertoire characters they are often only usable represent text limited subset human languages unicode attempt create common standard for representing all known languages most known character sets are subsets very large unicode character set although there are multiple character encodings available for unicode most common utf-8 which has advantage being backwards-compatible with ascii that every ascii text file also utf-8 text file with identical meaning formats on most operating systems name text file refers file format that allows only plain text content with very little formatting eg no bold italic types such files can be viewed edited on text terminals simple text editors text files usually have mime type text/plain usually with additional information indicating encoding windows text files ms-dos windows use common text file format with each line text separated by two-character combination carriage return cr line feed lf common for last line text not be terminated with cr-lf marker many text editors including notepad do not automatically insert one on last line on microsoft windows operating systems file regarded text file if suffix name file filename extension txt however many other suffixes are used for text files with specific purposes for example source code for computer programs usually kept text files that have file name suffixes indicating programming language which source written most windows text files use ansi oem unicode utf-8 encoding what windows terminology calls ansi encodings are usually single-byte iso-8859 encodings ie ansi microsoft notepad menus really system code page non-unicode legacy encoding except for locales such chinese japanese korean that require double-byte character sets ansi encodings were traditionally used default system locales within windows before transition unicode by contrast oem encodings also known ms-dos code pages were defined by ibm for use original ibm pc text mode display system they typically include graphical line-drawing characters common possibly full-screen ms-dos applications unicode-encoded windows text files contain text utf-16 unicode transformation format such files normally begin with byte order mark bom which communicates endianness file content although utf-8 does not suffer from endianness problems many windows programs ie notepad prepend contents utf-8-encoded files with bom differentiate utf-8 encoding from other 8-bit encodings unix text files on unix-like operating systems text files format precisely described posix defines text file file that contains characters organized into zero more lines where lines are sequences zero more non-newline characters plus terminating newline character normally lf additionally posix defines printable file text file whose characters are printable space backspace according regional rules this excludes control characters which are not printable apple macintosh
