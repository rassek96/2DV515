electronic memory often definition extended with requirement that treatment programs data memory be interchangeable uniform contents description history o candidates for first stored-program computer references further reading description computer with von neumann architecture stores program data instruction data same memory computer with harvard architecture has separate memories for storing program data both are stored-program designs stored-program computer sometimes used synonym for von neumann architecture however professor jack copeland considers that historically inappropriate refer electronic stored-program digital computers 'von neumann machines' hennessy patterson write that early harvard machines were regarded reactionary by advocates stored-program computers history stored-program computer idea can be traced back theoretical concept universal turing machine von neumann was aware this paper he impressed on his collaborators well many early computers such atanasoff–berry computer were not reprogrammable they executed single hardwired program there were no program instructions no program storage was necessary other computers though programmable stored their programs on punched tape which was physically fed into machine needed konrad zuse anticipated two patent applications that machine instructions could be stored same storage used for data university manchester's small-scale experimental machine ssem generally recognized world's first electronic computer that ran stored program—an event that occurred on june however ssem was not regarded full-fledged computer but more proof concept predecessor manchester mark computer which was first put research work april on may edsac cambridge ran its first program making arguably first complete fully operational regular electronic digital stored-program computer sometimes claimed that ibm ssec operational january was first stored-program computer this claim controversial not least because hierarchical memory system ssec because some aspects its operations like access relays tape drives were determined by plugging first stored-program computer be built continental europe was mesm completed soviet union candidates for first stored-program computer several computers could be considered first stored-program computer depending on criteria manchester small-scale experimental machine experimental computer that successfully ran stored program on june was subsequently developed into manchester mark which ran its first program early april edsac which became fully operational
