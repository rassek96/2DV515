pretty good privacy from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search pretty good privacy original authors phil zimmermann pgp inc network associates pgp corp developers symantec initial release development status active type encryption software license commercial proprietary software website wwwpgpcom pretty good privacy pgp encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy authentication for data communication pgp often used for signing encrypting decrypting texts e-mails files directories whole disk partitions increase security e-mail communications was created by phil zimmermann pgp similar software follow openpgp standard rfc for encrypting decrypting data contents design o compatibility o confidentiality o digital signatures o web trust o certificates o security quality history o early history o criminal investigation o pgp founding pgp inc o network associates acquisition o current situation pgp corporation encryption applications openpgp see also references further reading external links design how pgp encryption works pgp encryption uses serial combination hashing data compression symmetric-key cryptography finally public-key cryptography each step uses one several supported algorithms each public key bound user name and/or e-mail address first version this system was generally known web trust contrast with x509 system which uses hierarchical approach based on certificate authority which was added pgp implementations later current versions pgp encryption include both options through automated key management server compatibility pgp evolves versions that support newer features algorithms are able create encrypted messages that older pgp systems cannot decrypt even with valid private key therefore essential that partners pgp communication understand each other's capabilities at least agree on pgp settings confidentiality pgp can be used send messages confidentially for this pgp combines symmetric-key encryption public-key encryption message encrypted using symmetric encryption algorithm which requires symmetric key each symmetric key used only once also called session key message its session key are sent receiver session key must be sent receiver so they know how decrypt message but protect during transmission encrypted with receiver's public key only private key belonging receiver can decrypt session key digital signatures pgp supports message authentication integrity checking latter used detect whether message has been altered since was completed message integrity property former determine whether was actually sent by person entity claimed be sender digital signature because content encrypted any changes message will result failure decryption with appropriate key sender uses pgp create digital signature for message with either rsa dsa algorithms do so pgp computes hash also called message digest from plaintext then creates digital signature from that hash using sender's private key web trust main article web trust both when encrypting messages when verifying signatures critical that public key used send messages someone some entity actually does 'belong' intended recipient simply downloading public key from somewhere not overwhelming assurance that association deliberate accidental impersonation possible from its first version pgp has always included provisions for distributing user's public keys 'identity certificate' which also constructed cryptographically so that any tampering accidental garble readily detectable however merely making certificate which impossible modify without being detected insufficient this can prevent corruption only after certificate has been created not before users must also ensure by some means that public key certificate actually does belong person entity claiming from its first release pgp products have included internal certificate 'vetting scheme' assist with this trust model which has been called web trust given public key more specifically information binding user name key may be digitally signed by third party user attest association between someone actually user name key there are several levels confidence which can be included such signatures although many programs read write this information few if any include this level certification when calculating whether trust key web trust protocol was first described by phil zimmermann manual for pgp version time goes on you will accumulate keys from other people that you may want designate trusted introducers everyone else will each choose their own trusted introducers everyone will gradually accumulate distribute with their key collection certifying signatures from other people with expectation that anyone receiving will trust at least one two signatures this will cause emergence decentralized fault-tolerant web confidence for all public keys web trust mechanism has advantages over centrally managed public key infrastructure scheme such that used by s/mime but has not been universally used users have been willing accept certificates check their validity manually simply accept them no satisfactory solution has been found for underlying problem certificates more recent openpgp specification trust signatures can be used support creation certificate authorities trust signature indicates both that key belongs its claimed owner that owner key trustworthy sign other keys at one level below their own level signature comparable web trust signature since only validity key certified level signature similar trust one has certificate authority because key signed level able issue unlimited number level signatures level signature highly analogous trust assumption users must rely on whenever they use default certificate authority list like those included web browsers allows owner key make other keys certificate authorities pgp versions have always included way cancel 'revoke' identity certificates lost compromised private key will require this if communication security be retained by that user this more less equivalent certificate revocation lists centralised pki schemes recent pgp versions have also supported certificate expiration dates problem correctly identifying public key belonging particular user not unique pgp all public key/private key cryptosystems have same problem even if slightly different guises no fully satisfactory solution known pgp's original scheme at least leaves decision whether not use its endorsement/vetting system user while most other pki schemes do not requiring instead that every certificate attested by central certificate authority be accepted correct security quality best publicly available information there no known method which will allow person group break pgp encryption by cryptographic computational means indeed cryptographer bruce schneier characterized early version being closest you're likely get military-grade encryption early versions pgp have been found have theoretical vulnerabilities so current versions are recommended addition protecting data transit over network pgp encryption can also be used protect data long-term data storage such disk files these long-term storage options are also known data at rest ie data stored not transit cryptographic security pgp encryption depends on assumption that algorithms used are unbreakable by direct cryptanalysis with current equipment techniques original version rsa algorithm was used encrypt session keys rsa's security depends upon one-way function nature mathematical integer factoring similarly symmetric key algorithm used pgp version was idea which might at some point future be found have previously undetected cryptanalytic flaws specific instances current pgp idea insecurities if they exist are not publicly known current versions pgp have added additional encryption algorithms degree their cryptographic vulnerability varies with algorithm used practice each algorithms current use are not publicly known have cryptanalytic weaknesses new versions pgp are released periodically vulnerabilities are fixed by developers they come light any agency wanting read pgp messages would probably use easier means than standard cryptanalysis eg rubber-hose cryptanalysis black-bag cryptanalysis eg installing some form trojan horse keystroke logging software/hardware on target computer capture encrypted keyrings their passwords fbi has already used this attack against pgp its investigations however any such vulnerabilities apply not just pgp but any conventional encryption software incident involving seized psion pdas belonging members red brigade indicated that neither italian police nor fbi were able decrypt pgp-encrypted files stored on them more recent incident december see re boucher involving us customs agents who seized laptop pc that allegedly contained child pornography indicates that us government agencies find nearly impossible access pgp-encrypted files additionally magistrate judge ruling on case november has stated that forcing suspect reveal his pgp passphrase would violate his fifth amendment rights ie suspect's constitutional right not incriminate himself fifth amendment issue was opened again government appealed case federal district judge ordered defendant provide key evidence suggests that british police investigators are unable break pgp so instead have resorted using ripa legislation demand passwords/keys november british citizen was convicted under ripa legislation jailed for nine months for refusing provide police investigators with encryption keys pgp-encrypted files history early history phil zimmermann created first version pgp encryption name pretty good privacy was inspired by name grocery store ralph's pretty good grocery featured radio host garrison keillor's fictional town lake wobegon this first version included symmetric-key algorithm that zimmermann had designed himself named bassomatic after saturday night live sketch zimmermann had been long-time anti-nuclear activist created pgp encryption so that similarly inclined people might securely use bbss securely store messages files no license was required for its non-commercial use there was not even nominal charge complete source code was included with all copies posting june entitled pgp marks 10th anniversary zimmermann describes circumstances surrounding his release pgp was on this day that i sent first release pgp couple my friends for uploading internet first i sent allan hoeltje who posted peacenet isp that specialized grassroots political organizations mainly peace movement peacenet was accessible political activists all over world then i uploaded kelly goen who proceeded upload usenet newsgroup that specialized distributing source code at my request he marked usenet posting us only kelly also uploaded many bbs systems around country i don't recall if postings internet began on june 5th 6th may be surprising some that back i did not yet know enough about usenet newsgroups realize that us only tag was merely advisory tag that had little real effect on how usenet propagated newsgroup postings i thought actually controlled how usenet routed posting but back then i had no clue how post anything on newsgroup didn't even have clear idea what newsgroup was pgp found its way onto internet very rapidly acquired considerable following around world users supporters included dissidents totalitarian countries some affecting letters zimmermann have been published some which have been included testimony before us congress civil libertarians other parts world see zimmermann's published testimony various hearings 'free communications' activists who called themselves cypherpunks who provided both publicity distribution decades later cryptoparty who did much same via twitter criminal investigation shortly after its release pgp encryption found its way outside united states february zimmermann became formal target criminal investigation by us government for munitions export without license cryptosystems using keys larger than bits were then considered munitions within definition us export regulations pgp has never used keys smaller than bits so qualified at that time penalties for violation if found guilty were substantial after several years investigation zimmermann was closed without filing criminal charges against him anyone else zimmermann challenged these regulations imaginative way he published entire source code pgp hardback book via mit press which was distributed sold widely anybody wishing build their own copy pgp could cut off covers separate pages scan them using ocr program conceivably enter type-in program if ocr software was not available creating set source code text files one could then build application using freely available gnu compiler collection pgp would thus be available anywhere world claimed principle was simple export munitions—guns bombs planes software—was remains restricted but export books protected by first amendment question was never tested court with respect pgp cases addressing other encryption software however two federal appeals courts have established rule that cryptographic software source code speech protected by first amendment ninth circuit court appeals bernstein case sixth circuit court appeals junger case us export regulations regarding cryptography remain force but were liberalized substantially throughout late 1990s since compliance with regulations also much easier pgp encryption no longer meets definition non-exportable weapon can be exported internationally except seven specific countries list named groups individuals with whom substantially all us trade prohibited under various us export controls pgp founding pgp inc during this turmoil zimmermann's team worked on new version pgp encryption called pgp this new version was have considerable security improvements including new certificate structure which fixed small security flaws pgp 2x certificates well permitting certificate include separate keys for signing encryption furthermore experience with patent export problems led them eschew patents entirely pgp introduced use cast-128 aka cast5 symmetric key algorithm dsa elgamal asymmetric key algorithms all which were unencumbered by patents after federal criminal investigation ended zimmermann his team started company produce new versions pgp encryption they merged with viacrypt whom zimmermann had sold commercial rights who had licensed rsa directly from rsadsi which then changed its name pgp incorporated newly combined viacrypt/pgp team started work on new versions pgp encryption based on pgp system unlike pgp which was exclusively command line program pgp was designed from start software library allowing users work from command line inside gui environment original agreement between viacrypt zimmermann team had been that viacrypt would have even-numbered versions zimmermann odd-numbered versions viacrypt thus created new version based on pgp that they called pgp remove confusion about how could be that pgp was successor pgp pgp was renamed released pgp may network associates acquisition december pgp inc was acquired by network associates inc nai zimmermann pgp team became nai employees nai was first company have legal export strategy by publishing source code under nai pgp team added disk encryption desktop firewalls intrusion detection ipsec vpns pgp family after export regulation liberalizations which no longer required publishing source nai stopped releasing source code early zimmermann left nai he served chief cryptographer for hush communications who provide openpgp-based e-mail service hushmail he has also worked with veridis other companies october nai announced that its pgp assets were for sale that was suspending further development pgp encryption only remaining asset kept was pgp e-business server original pgp commandline version february nai canceled all support for pgp products with exception renamed commandline product nai formerly mcafee now intel security continued sell support product under name mcafee e-business server until current situation august several ex-pgp team members formed new company pgp corporation bought pgp assets except for command line version from nai new company was funded by rob theis doll capital management dcm terry garnett venrock associates pgp corporation supports existing pgp users honors nai's support contracts zimmermann now serves special advisor consultant pgp corporation well continuing run his own consulting company pgp corporation created new server-based product called pgp universal mid-2004 pgp corporation shipped its own command line version called pgp command line which integrates with other pgp encryption platform applications pgp corporation made its first acquisition—the german software company glück & kanja technology ag which now pgp deutschland ag pgp corporation acquired hamburg-based certificate authority tc trustcenter its parent company chosensecurity form its pgp trustcenter division since purchase nai's pgp assets pgp corporation has offered worldwide pgp technical support from its offices draper utah offenbach germany tokyo japan on april symantec corp announced that would acquire pgp for $300 million with intent

any user nist specified standard openpgp inside pgp inc there was still concern about patent issues rsadsi was challenging continuation viacrypt rsa license newly merged firm company adopted informal internal standard called unencumbered pgp use no algorithm with licensing difficulties because pgp encryption's importance worldwide many wanted write their own software that would interoperate with pgp zimmermann became convinced that open standard for pgp encryption was critical for them for cryptographic community whole july pgp inc proposed ietf that there be standard called openpgp they gave ietf permission use name openpgp describe this new standard well any program that supported standard ietf accepted proposal started openpgp working group openpgp on internet standards track under
