medieval muslim astronomers engineers astronomical clock tower su song c ad during song dynasty ramon llull invented lullian circle notional machine for calculating answers philosophical questions this case do with christianity via logical combinatorics this idea was taken up by leibniz centuries later thus one founding elements computing information science renaissance calculating tools set john napier's calculating tables from around scottish mathematician physicist john napier discovered that multiplication division numbers could be performed by addition subtraction respectively logarithms those numbers while producing first logarithmic tables napier needed perform many tedious multiplications was at this point that he designed his ' napier's bones' abacus-like device that greatly simplified calculations that involved multiplication division slide rule since real numbers can be represented distances intervals on line slide rule was invented 1620s shortly after napier's work allow multiplication division operations be carried out significantly faster than was previously possible edmund gunter built calculating device with single logarithmic scale at university oxford his device greatly simplified arithmetic calculations including multiplication division william oughtred greatly improved this with his circular slide rule he followed this up with modern slide rule essentially combination two gunter rules held together with hands slide rules were used by generations engineers other mathematically involved professional workers until invention pocket calculator mechanical calculators wilhelm schickard german polymath designed calculating machine which combined mechanised form napier's rods with world's first mechanical adding machine built into base because made use single-tooth gear there were circumstances which its carry mechanism would jam fire destroyed at least one machines believed schickard was too disheartened build another view through back pascal's calculator pascal invented his machine while still teenager blaise pascal started some pioneering work on calculating machines after three years effort prototypes he invented mechanical calculator he built twenty these machines called pascal's calculator pascaline following ten years nine pascalines have survived most which are on display european museums continuing debate exists over whether schickard pascal should be regarded inventor mechanical calculator range issues be considered discussed elsewhere gottfried wilhelm von leibniz invented stepped reckoner his famous stepped drum mechanism around he attempted create machine that could be used not only for addition subtraction but would utilise moveable carriage enable long multiplication division leibniz once said unworthy excellent men lose hours like slaves labour calculation which could safely be relegated anyone else if machines were used however leibniz did not incorporate fully successful carry mechanism leibniz also described binary numeral system central ingredient all modern computers however up 1940s many subsequent designs including charles babbage's machines even eniac were based on decimal system around charles xavier thomas de colmar created what would over rest century become first successful mass-produced mechanical calculator thomas arithmometer could be used add subtract with moveable carriage operator could also multiply divide by process long multiplication long division utilised stepped drum similar conception that invented by leibniz mechanical calculators remained use until 1970s punched card data processing joseph-marie jacquard developed loom which pattern being woven was controlled by paper tape constructed from punched cards paper tape could be changed without changing mechanical design loom this was landmark achievement programmability his machine was improvement over similar weaving looms punched cards were preceded by punch bands machine proposed by basile bouchon these bands would inspire information recording for automatic pianos more recently numerical control machine tools ibm punched card accounting machines pictured late 1880s american herman hollerith invented data storage on punched cards that could then be read by machine process these punched cards he invented tabulator keypunch machine his machines used electromechanical relays digital counters hollerith's method was used united states census that census was processed two years faster than prior census had been hollerith's company eventually became core ibm by electromechanical tabulating machines could add subtract print accumulated totals machine functions were directed by inserting dozens wire jumpers into removable control panels when united states instituted social security ibm punched card systems were used process records million workers punched cards became ubiquitous industry government for accounting administration leslie comrie's articles

engine curved back upon itself generally circular layout with long store exiting off one side later drawings depict regularized grid layout like central processing unit cpu modern computer mill would rely upon its own internal procedures roughly equivalent microcode modern cpus be stored form pegs inserted into rotating drums called barrels carry out some more complex instructions user's program might specify reconstruction babbage's analytical engine first general-purpose programmable computer programming language be employed by users was akin modern day assembly languages loops conditional branching were possible so language conceived would have been turing-complete later defined by alan turing three different types punch cards were used one for arithmetical operations one for numerical constants one for load store operations transferring numbers from store arithmetical unit back there were three separate readers for three types cards machine was about century ahead its time however project was slowed by various problems including disputes with chief machinist building parts for all parts for his machine had be made by hand—this was major problem for machine with thousands parts eventually project was dissolved with decision british government cease funding babbage's failure complete analytical engine can be chiefly attributed difficulties not only politics financing but also his desire develop increasingly sophisticated computer move ahead faster than anyone else could follow ada lovelace lord byron's daughter translated added notes sketch analytical engine by luigi federico menabrea this appears be first published description programming following babbage although unaware his earlier work was percy ludgate accountant from dublin ireland he independently designed programmable mechanical computer which he described work that was published analog computers main article analog computer sir william thomson's third tide-predicting machine design 1879–81 first half 20th century analog computers were considered by many be future computing these devices used continuously changeable aspects physical phenomena such electrical mechanical hydraulic quantities model problem being solved contrast digital computers that represented varying quantities symbolically their numerical values change analog computer does not use discrete values but rather continuous values processes cannot be reliably repeated with exact equivalence they can with turing machines first modern analog computer was tide-predicting machine invented by sir william thomson later lord kelvin used system pulleys wires automatically calculate predicted tide levels for set period at particular location was great utility navigation shallow waters his device was foundation for further developments analog computing differential analyser mechanical analog computer designed solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms was conceptualized by james thomson

moore school electrical engineering where eniac was built fully electronic general-purpose analog computer was built by helmut hölzer at peenemünde army research center by 1950s success digital electronic computers had spelled end for most analog computing machines but hybrid analog computers controlled by digital electronics remained substantial use into 1950s 1960s later some specialized applications advent digital computer principle modern computer was first described by computer scientist alan turing who set out idea his seminal paper on computable numbers turing reformulated kurt gödel's results on limits proof computation replacing gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with formal simple hypothetical devices that became known turing machines he proved that some such machine would be capable performing any conceivable mathematical computation if were representable algorithm he went on prove that there was no solution entscheidungsproblem by first showing that halting problem for turing machines undecidable general not possible decide algorithmically whether given turing machine will ever halt he also introduced notion 'universal machine' now known universal turing machine with idea that such machine could perform tasks any other machine other words provably capable computing anything that computable by executing program stored on tape allowing machine be programmable von neumann acknowledged that central concept modern computer was due this paper turing machines are this day central object study theory computation except for limitations imposed by their finite memory stores modern computers are said be turing-complete which say they have algorithm execution capability equivalent universal turing machine electromechanical computers era modern computing began with flurry development before during world war ii most digital computers built this period were electromechanical - electric switches drove mechanical relays perform calculation these devices had low operating speed were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers originally using vacuum tubes z2 was one earliest examples electromechanical relay computer was created by german engineer konrad zuse was improvement on his earlier z1 although used same mechanical memory replaced arithmetic control logic with electrical relay circuits replica zuse's z3 first fully automatic digital electromechanical computer same year electro-mechanical devices called bombes were built by british cryptologists help decipher german enigma-machine-encrypted secret messages during world war ii initial design bombe was produced at uk government code cypher school gc&cs at bletchley park by alan turing with important refinement devised by gordon welchman engineering design construction was work harold keen british tabulating machine company was substantial development from device that had been designed by polish cipher bureau cryptologist marian rejewski known cryptologic bomb polish bomba kryptologiczna zuse followed his earlier machine up with z3 world's first working electromechanical programmable fully automatic digital computer z3 was built with relays implementing bit word length that operated at clock frequency about 5–10 hz program code data were stored on punched film was quite similar modern machines some respects pioneering numerous advances such floating point numbers replacement hard-to-implement decimal system used charles babbage's earlier design by simpler binary system meant that zuse's machines were easier build potentially more reliable given technologies available at that time z3 was probably complete turing machine two patent applications zuse also anticipated that machine instructions could be stored same storage used for data—the key insight what became known von neumann architecture first implemented british ssem zuse suffered setbacks during world war ii when some his machines were destroyed course allied bombing campaigns apparently his work remained largely unknown engineers uk us until much later although at least ibm was aware financed his post-war startup company return for option on zuse's patents harvard mark i was constructed at ibm's endicott laboratories was similar general purpose electro-mechanical computer z3 but was not quite turing-complete digital computation mathematical basis digital computing boolean algebra developed by british mathematician george boole his work laws thought published his boolean algebra was further refined 1860s by william jevons charles sanders peirce was first presented systematically by ernst schröder n whitehead 1930s working independently american electronic engineer claude shannon soviet logician victor shestakov both showed one-to-one correspondence between concepts boolean logic certain electrical circuits now called logic gates which are now ubiquitous digital computers they showed that electronic relays switches can realize

force noyce also came up with his own idea integrated circuit half year later than kilby his chip solved many practical problems that kilby's had not produced at fairchild semiconductor was made silicon whereas kilby's chip was made germanium post-1960 integrated circuit based main articles history computing hardware 1960s–present history general-purpose cpus intel eight-bit microcontroller ic explosion use computers began with third-generation computers making use jack st clair kilby's robert noyce's independent invention integrated circuit microchip this led invention microprocessor while subject exactly which device was first microprocessor contentious partly due lack agreement on exact definition term microprocessor largely undisputed that first single-chip microprocessor was intel designed realized by ted hoff federico faggin stanley mazor at intel while earliest microprocessor ics literally contained only processor ie central processing unit computer their progressive development naturally led chips containing most all internal electronic parts computer integrated circuit image on right for example intel 8-bit microcontroller that includes cpu running at mhz bytes ram bytes eprom i/o same chip during 1960s there was considerable overlap between second third generation technologies ibm implemented its ibm solid logic technology modules hybrid circuits for ibm system/360 late sperry univac continued manufacture second-generation machines such univac burroughs large systems such b5000 were stack machines which allowed for simpler programming these pushdown automatons were also implemented minicomputers microprocessors later which influenced programming language design minicomputers served low-cost computer centers for industry business universities became possible simulate analog circuits with simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis spice on minicomputers one programs for electronic design automation eda microprocessor led development microcomputer small low-cost computers that could be owned by individuals small businesses microcomputers first which appeared 1970s became ubiquitous 1980s beyond while which specific system considered first microcomputer matter debate there were several unique hobbyist systems developed based on intel its successor intel first commercially available microcomputer kit was intel 8080-based altair which was announced january cover article popular electronics however this was extremely limited system its initial stages having only bytes dram its initial package no input-output except its toggle switches led register display despite this was initially surprisingly popular with several hundred sales first year demand rapidly outstripped supply several early third-party vendors such cromemco processor technology soon began supplying additional s-100 bus hardware for altair april at hannover fair olivetti presented p6060 world's first complete pre-assembled personal computer system central processing unit consisted two cards code named puce1 puce2 unlike most other personal computers was built with ttl components rather than microprocessor had one two floppy disk drives 32-character plasma display 80-column graphical thermal printer kbytes ram basic language weighed kg lb complete system this was significant step from altair though never achieved same success was competition with similar product by ibm that had external floppy disk drive from most microcomputers such mos technology kim-1 altair some versions apple i were sold kits for do-it-yourselfers pre-assembled systems did not gain much ground until with introduction apple ii tandy trs-80 commodore pet computing has evolved with microcomputer architectures with features added from their larger brethren now dominant most market segments next computer its object-oriented development tools libraries were used by tim berners-lee robert cailliau at cern develop world's first web server software cern httpd also used write first web browser worldwideweb these facts along with close association with steve jobs secure next place history one most significant computers all time systems complicated computers require very high reliability eniac remained on continuous operation from for eight years before being shut down although vacuum tube might fail would be replaced without bringing down system by simple strategy never shutting down eniac failures were dramatically reduced vacuum-tube sage air-defense computers became remarkably reliable – installed pairs one off-line tubes likely fail did so when computer was intentionally run at reduced power find them hot-pluggable hard disks like hot-pluggable vacuum tubes yesteryear continue tradition repair during continuous operation semiconductor memories routinely have no errors when they operate although operating systems like unix have employed memory tests on start-up detect failing hardware today requirement reliable performance made even more stringent when server farms are delivery platform google has managed this by using fault-tolerant software recover from hardware failures even working on concept replacing entire server farms on-the-fly during service event 21st century multi-core cpus became commercially available content-addressable memory cam has become inexpensive enough be used networking frequently used for on-chip cache memory modern microprocessors although no computer system has yet implemented hardware cams for use programming languages currently cams associative arrays software are programming-language-specific semiconductor memory cell arrays are very regular structures manufacturers prove their processes on them this allows price reductions on memory products during 1980s cmos logic gates developed into devices that could be made fast other circuit types computer power consumption could therefore be decreased dramatically unlike continuous current draw gate based on other logic types cmos gate only draws significant current during 'transition' between logic states except for leakage this has allowed computing become commodity which now ubiquitous embedded many forms from greeting cards telephones satellites thermal design power which dissipated during operation has become essential computing speed operation servers consumed 15% total energy budget us energy consumption computer data centers was expected double 3% world consumption by soc system on chip has compressed even more integrated circuitry into single chip socs are enabling phones pcs converge
