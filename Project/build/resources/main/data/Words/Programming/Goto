goto from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search this article about programming statement high-level languages for other uses see goto disambiguation goto goto goto go other case combinations depending on programming language statement found many computer programming languages performs one-way transfer control another line code contrast function call normally returns control jumped-to locations are usually identified using labels though some languages use line numbers at machine code level goto form branch jump statement many languages support goto statement many do not see language support structured program theorem proved that goto statement not necessary write programs some combination three programming constructs sequence selection/choice repetition/iteration are sufficient for any computation that can be performed by turing machine with caveat that code duplication additional variables may need be introduced past there was considerable debate academia industry on merits use goto statements use goto was formerly common but since advent structured programming 1960s 1970s its use has declined significantly primary criticism that code that uses goto statements harder understand than alternative constructions goto remains use certain common usage patterns but alternatives are generally used if available debates over its more limited uses continue academia software industry circles contents usage criticism common usage patterns goto alternatives o structured programming o exceptions o tail calls o coroutines o continuations o message passing variations o computed goto assigned goto o alter o perl goto o emulated goto o pl/i label variables language support see also references usage goto label goto statement often combined with if statement cause conditional transfer control if condition then goto label programming languages impose different restrictions with respect destination goto statement for example c programming language does not permit jump label contained within another function however jumps within single call chain are possible using setjmp/longjmp functions criticism although at pre-algol meeting held heinz zemanek explicitly threw doubts on necessity goto statements at time no one paid attention his remark including edsger dijkstra who would later become iconic opponent goto 1970s 1980s saw decline use goto statements favor structured programming paradigm with goto criticized leading unmaintainable spaghetti code see below some programming style coding standards for example gnu pascal coding standards recommend against use goto statements böhm-jacopini proof did not settle question whether adopt structured programming for software development partly because construction was more likely obscure program than improve because its application requires introduction additional local variables has however sparked prominent debate among computer scientists educators language designers application programmers that saw slow but steady shift away from formerly ubiquitous use goto probably most famous criticism goto letter by edsger dijkstra called go statement considered harmful that letter dijkstra argued that unrestricted goto statements should be abolished from higher-level languages because they complicated task analyzing verifying correctness programs particularly those involving loops letter itself sparked debate including 'goto considered harmful' considered harmful letter sent communications acm cacm march well further replies by other people including dijkstra's on somewhat disappointing correspondence alternative viewpoint presented donald knuth's structured programming with go statements which analyzes many common programming tasks finds that some them goto optimal language construct use their quasi-standard book on c programming language dennis ritchie brian kernighan warn that goto infinitely abusable but also suggest that could be used for end-of-function error handlers for multi-level breaks from loops these two patterns can be found numerous subsequent books on c by other authors introductory textbook notes that error handling pattern way work around lack built-in exception handling within c language other programmers such linux kernel designer coder linus torvalds software engineer book author steve mcconnell also object dijkstra's point view stating that gotos can be useful language feature improving program speed size code clearness but only when used sensible way by comparably sensible programmer according computer science professor john regehr there were about instances goto linux kernel code other academics took completely opposite viewpoint argued that even instructions like break return from middle loops are bad practice they are not needed böhm-jacopini result thus advocated that loops should have single exit point for instance bertrand meyer wrote his textbook that instructions like break continue are just old goto sheep's clothing slightly modified form böhm-jacopini result allows however avoidance additional variables structured programming long multi-level breaks from loops are allowed because some languages like c don't allow multi-level breaks via their break keyword some textbooks advise programmer use goto such circumstances misra c standard bans goto continue well multiple return break statements edition misra c standard has downgraded prohibition on goto from required advisory status edition has additional mandatory rule that prohibits only backward but not forward jumps with goto fortran introduced structured programming constructs successive revisions relatively loose semantic rules governing allowable use goto were tightened extended range which programmer could use goto enter leave still-executing do loop was removed from language by several forms fortran goto including computed goto assigned goto had been deleted from language some widely used modern programming languages such java python lack goto statement – see language support – though most provide some means breaking out selection either breaking out moving on next step iteration viewpoint that disturbing control flow code undesirable may be seen design some programming languages for instance ada visually emphasizes label definitions using angle brackets entry complangc faq list addresses issue goto use directly stating programming style like writing style somewhat art cannot be codified by inflexible rules although discussions about style often seem center exclusively around such rules case goto statement has long been observed that unfettered use goto's quickly leads unmaintainable spaghetti code however simple unthinking ban on goto statement does not necessarily lead immediately beautiful programming unstructured programmer just capable constructing byzantine tangle without using any goto's perhaps substituting oddly-nested loops boolean control variables instead many programmers adopt moderate stance goto's are usually be avoided but are acceptable few well-constrained situations if necessary multi-level break statements coalesce common actions inside switch statement centralize cleanup tasks function with several error returns blindly avoiding certain constructs following rules without understanding them can lead just many problems rules were supposed avert furthermore many opinions on programming style are just that opinions they may be strongly argued strongly felt they may be backed up by solid-seeming evidence arguments but opposing opinions may be just strongly felt supported argued it's usually futile get dragged into style wars because on certain issues opponents can never seem agree agree disagree stop arguing common usage patterns goto while overall usage gotos has been declining there are still situations some languages where goto provides shortest most straightforward way express program's logic while it's possible express same logic without gotos equivalent code will be longer often more difficult understand other languages there are structured alternatives notably exceptions tail calls situations which goto often useful include make code more readable easier follow make smaller programs get rid code duplication implement finite-state machine using state transition table goto switch between states absence tail call elimination particularly automatically generated c code for example goto canonical lr parser implementing multi-level break continue if not directly supported language this common idiom c although java reserves goto keyword doesn't actually implement instead java implements labelled break labelled continue statements according java documentation use gotos for multi-level breaks was most common 90% use gotos c java was not first language take this approach—forbidding goto but providing multi-level breaks— bliss programming language more precisely bliss-11 version thereof preceded this respect 960–965 surrogates for single-level break continue retry statements when potential introduction additional loops could incorrectly affect control flow this practice has been observed netbsd code error handling absence exceptions particularly cleanup code such resource deallocation c++ offers alternative goto statement for this use case which resource acquisition initialization raii through using destructors using try catch exceptions used exception handling setjmp longjmp are another alternative have advantage being able unwind part call stack these uses are relatively common c but much less common c++ other languages with higher-level features however throwing catching exception inside function can be extraordinarily inefficient some languages prime example objective-c where goto much faster alternative another use goto statements modify poorly factored legacy code where avoiding goto would require extensive refactoring code duplication for example given large function where only certain code interest goto statement allows one jump from only relevant code without otherwise modifying function this usage considered code smell but finds occasional use alternatives structured programming for clarity efficient optimization languages supporting structured programming like pascal introduced control structures such subroutines also known procedures functions loops using while repeat until do for statements switch aka case statements form multiway branching these new language mechanism replace equivalent flows which previously would have been written using gotos ifs multi-way branching replaces computed goto which instruction jump determined dynamically conditionally exceptions further information exception handling practice strict adherence basic three-structure template structured programming yields highly nested code due inability exit structured unit prematurely combinatorial explosion with quite complex program state data handle all possible conditions two solutions have been generally adopted way exit structured unit prematurely more generally exceptions – both cases these go up structure returning control enclosing blocks functions but do not jump arbitrary code locations these are analogous use return statement non-terminal position – not strictly structured due early exit but mild relaxation strictures structured programming c break continue allow one terminate loop continue next iteration without requiring extra while if statement some languages multi-level breaks are also possible for handling exceptional situations specialized exception handling constructs were added such try/catch/finally java throw-catch exception handling mechanisms can also be easily abused create non-transparent control structures just like goto can be abused tail calls main article tail call paper delivered acm conference seattle guy l steele summarized debate over goto structured programming observed that procedure calls tail position procedure can be most optimally treated direct transfer control called procedure typically eliminating unnecessary stack manipulation operations since such tail calls are very common lisp language where procedure calls are ubiquitous this form optimization considerably reduces cost procedure call compared goto used other languages steele argued that poorly implemented procedure calls had led artificial perception that goto was cheap compared procedure call steele further argued that general procedure calls may be usefully thought goto statements which also pass parameters can be uniformly coded machine code jump instructions with machine code stack manipulation instructions considered optimization rather than vice versa steele cited evidence that well optimized numerical algorithms lisp could execute faster than code produced by then-available commercial fortran compilers because cost procedure call lisp was much lower scheme lisp dialect developed by steele with gerald jay sussman tail call optimization mandatory although steele's paper did not introduce much that was new computer science at least was practised at mit brought light scope for procedure call optimization which made modularity-promoting qualities procedures into more credible alternative then-common coding habits large monolithic procedures with complex internal control structures extensive state data particular tail call optimizations discussed by steele turned procedure into credible way implementing iteration through single tail recursion tail recursion calling same function further tail call optimization allows mutual recursion unbounded depth assuming tail calls – this allows transfer control finite state machines which otherwise generally accomplished with goto statements coroutines main article coroutine coroutines are more radical relaxation structured programming allowing not only multiple exit points returns non-tail position but also multiple entry points similar goto statements coroutines are more restricted than goto they can only resume currently running coroutine at specified points – continuing after yield – rather than jumping arbitrary point code limited form coroutines are generators which are sufficient for some purposes even more limited are closures – subroutines which maintain state via static variables but not execution position combination state variables structured control notably overall switch statement can allow subroutine resume execution at arbitrary point on subsequent calls structured alternative goto statements absence coroutines this common idiom c for example continuations main article continuation continuation similar goto that transfers control from arbitrary point program previously marked point continuation more flexible than goto those languages that support because can transfer control out current function something that goto cannot do most structured programming languages those language implementations that maintain stack frames for storage local variables function arguments executing continuation involves adjusting program's call stack addition jump longjmp function c programming language example escape continuation that may be used escape current context surrounding one common lisp go operator also has this stack unwinding property despite construct being lexically scoped label be jumped can be referenced from closure scheme continuations can even move control from outer context inner one if desired this almost limitless control over what code executed next makes complex control structures such coroutines cooperative multitasking relatively easy write message passing main article message passing non-procedural paradigms goto less relevant completely absent one main alternatives message passing which particular importance concurrent computing interprocess communication object oriented programming these cases individual components do not have arbitrary transfer control but overall control may be scheduled complex ways such via preemption influential languages simula smalltalk were among first introduce concepts messages objects by encapsulating state data object-oriented programming reduced software complexity interactions messages between objects variations there are number different language constructs under class goto statements computed goto assigned goto see also branch table fortran computed goto jumps one several labels list based on value expression example goto i equivalent construct c switch statement newer fortran case statement recommend syntactical alternative basic has on goto construct that achieves same goal fortran also had assigned goto variant that transfers control statement label line number which stored assigned integer variable jumping integer variable that had not been assigned was unfortunately possible was major source bugs involving assigned gotos fortran assign statement only allows constant existing line number be assigned integer variable however was possible accidentally treat this variable integer thereafter for example increment resulting unspecified behavior at goto time following code demonstrates behavior goto i when line i unspecified assign i i = i+1 goto i unspecified behavior write this valid line number several c compilers implement two non-standard c/c++ extensions relating gotos originally introduced by gcc gnu extension allows address label inside current function be obtained void using unary prefix label value operator && goto instruction also extended allow jumping arbitrary void expression this c extension referred computed goto documentation c compilers that support its semantics are superset fortran's assigned goto because allows arbitrary pointer expressions goto target while fortran's assigned goto doesn't allow arbitrary expressions jump target with standard goto c gnu c extension allows target computed goto reside only current function attempting jump outside current function results unspecified behavior some variants basic also support computed goto sense used gnu c ie which target can be any line number not just one from list for example mts basic one could write goto i1000 jump line numbered times value variable i which might represent selected menu option for example pl/i label variables achieve effect computed assigned gotos alter up ansi cobol standard had alter verb which could be used change destination existing go which had be paragraph by itself feature which allowed polymorphism was frequently condemned seldom used perl goto perl there variant goto statement that not traditional goto statement at all takes function name transfers control by effectively substituting one function call for another tail call new function will not return goto but instead place from which original function was called emulated goto there are several programming languages that do not support goto by default by using goto emulation still possible use goto these programming languages albeit with some restrictions one can emulate goto java javascript python pl/i label variables pl/i has data type label which can be used implement both assigned goto computed goto pl/i allows branches out current block calling procedure can pass label argument called procedure which can then exit with branch / this implements equivalent / / assigned goto / declare where label where = somewhere goto where somewhere / statement / / this implements equivalent / / computed goto / declare where label declare inx fixed where1 = abc where2 = xyz goto whereinx abc / statement / xyz / statement / language support many languages support goto statement many do not java goto reserved word but unusable although compiled fileclass generates gotos labels python does not have support for goto other than joke module goto php there was no native support for goto until version libraries were available emulate its functionality c has goto also makes case default statements labels whose scope enclosing switch statement goto case goto default often used replace explicit fall-through which c disallows c has goto
