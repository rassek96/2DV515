σημαντικός sēmantikos significant primarily linguistic also philosophical study meaning—in language programming languages formal logics semiotics focuses on relationship between signifiers —like words phrases signs symbols—and what they stand for their denotation international scientific vocabulary semantics also called semasiology word semantics was first used by michel bréal french philologist denotes range ideas—from popular highly technical often used ordinary language for denoting problem understanding that comes down word selection connotation this problem understanding has been subject many formal enquiries over long period time especially field formal semantics linguistics study interpretation signs symbols used agents communities within particular circumstances contexts within this view sounds facial expressions body language proxemics have semantic meaningful content each comprises several branches study written language things like paragraph structure punctuation bear semantic content other forms language bear other semantic content formal study semantics intersects with many other fields inquiry including lexicology syntax pragmatics etymology others independently semantics also well-defined field its own right often with synthetic properties philosophy language semantics reference are closely connected further related fields include philology communication semiotics formal study semantics can therefore be manifold complex semantics contrasts with syntax study combinatorics units language without reference their meaning pragmatics study relationships between symbols language their meaning users language semantics field study also has significant ties various representational theories meaning including truth theories meaning coherence theories

concern how meaning attaches larger chunks text possibly result composition from smaller units meaning traditionally semantics has included study sense denotative reference truth conditions argument structure thematic roles discourse analysis linkage all these syntax montague grammar late 1960s richard montague proposed system for defining semantic entries lexicon terms lambda calculus these terms syntactic parse sentence john ate every bagel would consist subject john predicate ate every bagel montague demonstrated that meaning sentence altogether could be decomposed into meanings its parts relatively few rules combination logical predicate thus obtained would be elaborated further eg using truth theory models which ultimately relate meanings set tarskiian universals which may lie outside logic notion such meaning atoms primitives basic language thought hypothesis from 1970s despite its elegance montague grammar was limited by context-dependent variability word sense led several attempts at incorporating context such situation semantics 1980s truth-values are incomplete they get assigned based on context generative lexicon 1990s categories types are incomplete get assigned based on context dynamic turn semantics linguistics theoretical cognitive constraint-based generative structuralist quantitative functional theories grammar phonology morphology

there was no mechanism for learning semantic relations nativist view considered all semantic notions inborn thus even novel concepts were proposed have been dormant some sense this view was also thought unable address many issues such metaphor associative meanings semantic change where meanings within linguistic community change over time qualia subjective experience another issue not addressed by nativist model was how perceptual cues are combined thought eg mental rotation this view semantics innate finite meaning inherent lexical unit that can be composed generate meanings for larger chunks discourse now being fiercely debated emerging domain cognitive linguistics also non-fodorian camp philosophy language challenge motivated by factors internal language such problem resolving indexical anaphora eg this x him last week these situations context serves input but interpreted utterance also modifies context so also output thus interpretation necessarily dynamic meaning sentences viewed contexts changing potentials instead propositions factors external language ie language not set labels stuck on things but toolbox importance whose elements lie way they function rather than their attachments things this view reflects position later wittgenstein his famous game example related positions quine davidson others concrete example latter phenomenon semantic underspecification – meanings are not complete without some elements context take example one word red its meaning phrase such red book similar many other usages can be viewed compositional however colours implied phrases such red wine very dark red hair coppery red soil red skin are very different indeed these colours by themselves would not be called red by native speakers these instances are contrastive so red wine so called only comparison with other kind wine which also not white for same reasons this view goes back de saussure each set synonyms like redouter 'to dread' craindre 'to fear' avoir peur 'to be afraid' has its particular value only because they stand contrast with one another no word has value that can be identified independently what else its vicinity may go back earlier indian views on language especially nyaya view words indicators not carriers meaning attempt defend system based on propositional meaning for semantic underspecification can be found generative lexicon model james pustejovsky who extends contextual operations based on type shifting into lexicon thus meanings are generated on fly you go based on finite context prototype theory another set concepts related fuzziness semantics based on prototypes work eleanor rosch 1970s led view that natural categories are not characterizable terms necessary sufficient conditions but are graded fuzzy at their boundaries inconsistent status their constituent members one may compare with jung's archetype though concept archetype sticks static concept some post-structuralists are against fixed static meaning words derrida following nietzsche talked about slippages fixed meanings systems categories are not objectively out there world but are rooted people's experience these categories evolve learned concepts world – meaning not objective truth but subjective construct learned from experience language arises out grounding our conceptual systems shared embodiment bodily experience corollary this that conceptual categories ie lexicon will not be identical for different cultures indeed for every individual same culture this leads another debate see sapir–whorf hypothesis eskimo words for snow theories semantics model theoretic semantics main article formal semantics linguistics originates from montague's work see above highly formalized theory natural language semantics which expressions are assigned denotations meanings such individuals truth values functions from one these another truth sentence more interestingly its logical relation other sentences then evaluated relative model formal truth-conditional semantics main article truth-conditional semantics pioneered by philosopher donald davidson another formalized theory which aims associate each natural language sentence with meta-language description conditions under which true for example 'snow white' true if only if snow white challenge arrive at truth conditions for any sentences from fixed meanings assigned individual words fixed rules for how combine them practice truth-conditional semantics similar model-theoretic semantics conceptually however they differ that truth-conditional semantics seeks connect language with statements about real world form meta-language statements rather than with abstract models lexical conceptual semantics main article conceptual semantics this theory effort explain properties argument structure assumption behind this theory that syntactic properties phrases reflect meanings words that head them with this theory linguists can better deal with fact that subtle differences word meaning correlate with other differences syntactic structure that word appears way this gone about by looking at internal structure words these small parts that make up internal structure words are termed semantic primitives lexical semantics main article lexical semantics linguistic theory that investigates word meaning this theory understands that meaning word fully reflected by its context here meaning word constituted by its contextual relations therefore distinction between degrees participation well modes participation are made order accomplish this distinction any part sentence that bears meaning combines with meanings other constituents labeled semantic constituent semantic constituents that cannot be broken down into more elementary constituents are labeled minimal semantic constituents computational semantics main article computational semantics computational semantics focused on processing linguistic meaning order do this concrete algorithms architectures are described within this framework algorithms architectures are also analyzed terms decidability time/space complexity data structures they require communication protocols computer science main article semantics computer science computer science term semantics refers meaning languages opposed their form syntax according euzenat semantics provides rules for interpreting syntax which do not provide meaning directly but constrains possible interpretations what declared other words semantics about interpretation expression additionally term applied certain types data structures specifically designed used for representing information content programming languages semantics programming languages other languages important issue area study computer science like syntax language its semantics can be defined exactly for instance following statements use different syntaxes but cause same instructions be executed statement programming languages x += y c c++

describe semantics programming languages formally building on mathematical logic operational semantics meaning construct specified by computation induces when executed on machine particular interest how effect computation produced denotational semantics meanings are modelled by mathematical objects that represent effect executing constructs thus only effect interest not how obtained axiomatic semantics specific properties effect executing constructs are expressed assertions thus there may be aspects executions that are ignored semantic models terms such semantic network semantic data model are used describe particular types data model characterized by use directed graphs which vertices denote concepts entities world arcs denote relationships between them semantic web refers extension world wide web via embedding added semantic metadata using semantic data modelling techniques such resource description framework rdf web ontology language owl psychology psychology semantic memory memory for meaning – other words aspect memory that preserves only gist general significance remembered experience – while episodic memory memory for ephemeral details – individual features unique particulars experience term 'episodic memory' was introduced by tulving schacter context 'declarative memory' which involved simple association factual objective information concerning its object word meaning measured by company they keep ie relationships among words themselves semantic network memories may be transferred intergenerationally isolated one generation due cultural disruption different generations may have different experiences at similar points their own time-lines this may then create vertically heterogeneous semantic net for certain words otherwise homogeneous culture network
