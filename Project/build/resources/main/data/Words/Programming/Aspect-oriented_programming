recursive value-level contrast function-level probabilistic concept v t e computing aspect-oriented programming aop programming paradigm that aims increase modularity by allowing separation cross-cutting concerns does so by adding additional behavior existing code advice without modifying code itself instead separately specifying which code modified via pointcut specification such log all function calls when function's name begins with 'set' this allows behaviors that are not central business logic such logging be added program without cluttering code core functionality aop forms basis for aspect-oriented software development aop includes programming methods tools that support modularization concerns at level source code while aspect-oriented software development refers whole engineering discipline aspect-oriented programming entails breaking down program logic into distinct parts so-called concerns cohesive areas functionality nearly all programming paradigms support some level grouping encapsulation concerns into separate independent entities by providing abstractions eg functions procedures modules classes methods that can be used for implementing abstracting composing these concerns some concerns cut across multiple abstractions program defy these forms implementation these concerns are called cross-cutting concerns horizontal concerns logging exemplifies crosscutting concern because logging strategy necessarily affects every logged part system logging thereby crosscuts all logged classes methods all aop implementations have some crosscutting expressions that encapsulate each concern one place difference between implementations lies power safety usability constructs provided for example interceptors that specify methods intercept express limited form crosscutting without much support for type-safety debugging aspectj has number such expressions encapsulates them special class aspect for example aspect can alter behavior base code non-aspect part program by applying advice additional behavior at various join points points program specified quantification query called pointcut that detects whether given join point matches aspect can also make binary-compatible structural changes other classes like adding members parents contents history motivation basic concepts join point models o aspectj's join-point model o other potential

xerox parc developed explicit concept aop followed this with aspectj aop extension java ibm's research team pursued tool approach over language design approach proposed hyper/j concern manipulation environment which have not seen wide usage examples this article use aspectj most widely known aop language microsoft transaction server considered be first major application aop followed by enterprise javabeans motivation basic concepts typically aspect scattered tangled code making harder understand maintain scattered by virtue function such logging being spread over number unrelated functions that might use its function possibly entirely unrelated systems different source languages etc that means change logging can require modifying all affected modules aspects become tangled not only with mainline function systems which they are expressed but also with each other that means changing one concern entails understanding all tangled concerns having some means by which effect changes can be inferred for example consider banking application with conceptually very simple method for transferring amount from one account another void transferaccount fromacc account toacc int
