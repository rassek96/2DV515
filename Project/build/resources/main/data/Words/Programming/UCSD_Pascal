systems working state historic initial release years ago latest release version iv2 available english platforms apple ii dec pdp-11 zilog z80 mos motorola x86 pascal microengine ti 99/4a kernel type p-code virtual machine ucsd pascal was pascal programming language system that ran on ucsd p-system portable highly machine-independent operating system ucsd pascal was first released was developed at university california san diego ucsd contents ucsd pascal p-system history versions further use see also notes further reading external links ucsd pascal p-system university california san diego ucsd institute for information systems developed ucsd pascal provide students with common environment that could run on any then available microcomputers well campus dec pdp-11 minicomputers operating system became known ucsd p-system ucsd p-system was one three operating systems along with pc dos cp/m-86 that ibm offered for its original ibm pc vendor softech microsystems emphasized p-system's application portability with virtual machines for cpus ibm pc's release predicted that users would be able use applications they purchased on future computers running p-system advertisements called universal operating system pc magazine denounced ucsd p-system on ibm pc stating review context mba written language that simply does not produce good code p-system did not sell very well for ibm pc because lack applications because was more expensive than other choices previously ibm had offered ucsd p-system option for displaywriter 8086-based dedicated word processing machine not be confused with ibm's displaywrite word processing software displaywriter's native operating system had been developed completely internally was not opened for end-user programming notable extensions standard pascal include separately compilable units string type both these extensions influenced design ada language some intrinsics were provided accelerate string processing eg scanning array for particular search pattern other language extensions were provided allow ucsd p-system be self-compiling self-hosted ucsd pascal was based on p-code machine architecture its contribution these early virtual machines was extend p-code away from its roots compiler intermediate language into full execution environment ucsd pascal p-machine was optimized for new small microcomputers with addressing restricted 16-bit only kb memory james gosling cites ucsd pascal key influence along with smalltalk virtual machine on design java virtual machine ucsd p-system achieved machine independence by defining virtual machine called p-machine pseudo-machine which many users began call pascal-machine like os—although ucsd documentation always used pseudo-machine with its own instruction set called p-code pseudo-code urs ammann student niklaus wirth originally presented p-code his phd thesis from which ucsd implementation was derived zurich pascal-p implementation ucsd implementation changed zurich implementation be byte oriented ucsd p-code was optimized for execution pascal programming language each hardware platform then only needed p-code interpreter program written for port entire p-system all tools run on later versions also included additional languages that compiled p-code base for example apple computer offered fortran compiler written by silicon valley software sunnyvale california producing p-code that ran on apple version p-system later telesoft also located san diego offered early ada development environment that used p-code was therefore able run on number hardware platforms including motorola system/370 pascal microengine ucsd p-system shares some concepts with more current java platform both use virtual machine hide operating system hardware differences both use programs written that virtual machine provide cross-platform support likewise both systems allow virtual machine be used either complete operating system target computer run box under another operating system ucsd pascal compiler was distributed part portable operating system p-system history ucsd p-system began around idea ucsd's kenneth bowles who believed that number new computing platforms coming out at time would make difficult for new programming languages gain acceptance he based ucsd pascal on pascal-p2 release portable compiler from zurich he was particularly interested pascal language teach programming ucsd introduced two features that were important improvements on original pascal variable length strings units independently compiled code idea included into then-evolving ada programming language niklaus wirth credits p-system ucsd pascal particular with popularizing pascal was not until release turbo pascal that ucsd's version started slip from first place among pascal users pascal dialect ucsd pascal came from subset pascal implemented pascal-p2 which was not designed be full implementation language but rather minimum subset that would self-compile fit its function bootstrap kit for pascal compilers ucsd added strings from basic several other implementation dependent features although ucsd pascal later obtained many other features full pascal language pascal-p2 subset persisted other dialects notably borland pascal which copied much ucsd dialect versions there were four versions ucsd p-code engine each with several revisions p-system ucsd pascal revision p-code engine ie p-machine meant change p-code language therefore compiled code not portable between different p-machine versions each revision was represented with leading roman numeral while operating system revisions were enumerated dot number following p-code roman numeral for example ii3 represented third revision p-system running on second revision p-machine version i original version never officially distributed outside university california san diego however pascal sources for both versions i3 i5 were freely exchanged between interested users specifically patch revision i5a was known be one most stable version ii widely distributed available on many early microcomputers numerous versions included apple ii dec pdp-11 zilog z80 mos based machines motorola ibm pc version ii on pc was restricted one 64k code segment one 64k stack/heap data segment version iv removed code segment limit but cost lot more project members from this era include dr kenneth l bowles mark allen richard gleaves richard kaufmann pete lawrence joel mccormack mark overgaard keith shillington roger sumner john van zandt version iii custom version written for western digital run on their pascal microengine microcomputer included support for parallel processes for first time version iv commercial version developed sold by softech based on version ii did not include changes from version iii did not sell well due combination their pricing structure performance problems due p-code interpreter competition with native operating systems on top which often ran after softech dropped product was picked up by pecan systems relatively small company formed p-system users fans sales revived somewhat due mostly pecan's reasonable pricing structure but p-system ucsd pascal gradually lost market native operating systems compilers available for ti-99/4 equipped with p-code card commodore pet further use corvus systems computer used uscd pascal for all its user
