codirecting mit project on mathematics computation project mit computer science artificial intelligence laboratory previously joint project ai lab lcs csail's components goal project create better computational tools for scientists engineers but even with powerful numerical computers exploring complex physical systems still requires substantial human effort human judgement prepare simulations interpret numerical results together with their students abelson sussman are combining techniques from numerical computation symbolic algebra heuristic programming develop programs that not only perform massive numerical computations but that also interpret these computations discuss results qualitative terms programs such these could form basis for intelligent scientific instruments that monitor physical systems based upon high-level behavioral descriptions more generally they could lead new generation computational tools that can autonomously explore complex physical systems which will play important part future practice science engineering at same time these programs incorporate computational formulations scientific knowledge that can form foundations better ways teach science
