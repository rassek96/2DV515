string computer science from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search this article about data type for other uses see string disambiguation this article needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged removed march learn how when remove this template message strings are applied eg bioinformatics describe dna strands composed nitrogenous bases computer programming string traditionally sequence characters either literal constant some kind variable latter may allow its elements be mutated length changed may be fixed after creation string generally understood data type often implemented array bytes words that stores sequence elements typically characters using some character encoding string may also denote more general arrays other sequence list data types structures depending on programming language precise data type used variable declared be string may either cause storage memory be statically allocated for predetermined maximum length employ dynamic allocation allow hold variable number elements when string appears literally source code known string literal

finite set symbols alternatively called characters called alphabet no assumption made about nature symbols string word over σ any finite sequence symbols from σ for example if σ = {0 1} then string over σ length string s number symbols s length sequence can be any non-negative integer often denoted |s| empty string unique string over σ length denoted ε λ set all strings over σ length n denoted σn for example if σ = {0 1} then σ2 = {00 11} note that σ0 = {ε} for any alphabet σ set all strings over σ any length kleene closure σ denoted σ terms σn σ ∗ = ⋃ n ∈ n ∪ { } σ n {\displaystyle \sigma ^{}=\bigcup {n\in \mathbb {n} \cup \{0\}}\sigma ^{n}} for example if σ = {0 1} then σ = {ε } although set σ itself countably infinite each element σ string finite length set strings over σ ie any subset σ called formal language over σ for example if σ = {0 1} set strings with even number zeros {ε } formal language over σ concatenation substrings concatenation important binary operation on σ for any two strings s t σ their concatenation defined sequence symbols s followed by sequence characters t denoted st for example if σ = {a b z} s = bear t = hug then st = bearhug ts = hugbear string concatenation associative but non-commutative operation empty string ε serves identity element for any string s εs = sε = s therefore set σ concatenation operation form monoid free monoid generated by σ addition length function defines monoid homomorphism from σ non-negative integers that function l σ ∗ ↦ n ∪ { } {\displaystyle l\sigma ^{}\mapsto \mathbb {n} \cup \{0\}} such that l s t = l s + l t ∀ s t ∈ σ ∗ {\displaystyle lst=ls+lt\quad \forall st\in \sigma ^{}} string s said be substring factor t if there exist possibly empty strings u v such that t = usv relation substring defines partial order on σ least element which empty string prefixes suffixes string s said be prefix t if there exists string u such that t = su if u nonempty s said be proper prefix t symmetrically string s said be suffix t if there exists string u such that t = us if u nonempty s said be proper suffix t suffixes prefixes are substrings t both relations prefix suffix are prefix orders rotations string s = uv said be rotation t if t = vu for example if σ = {0 1} string rotation where u = v = reversal reverse string string with same symbols but reverse order for example if s = abc where b c are symbols alphabet then reverse s cba string that reverse itself eg s = madam called palindrome which also includes empty string all strings length lexicographical ordering often useful define ordering on set strings if alphabet σ has total order cf alphabetical order one can define total order on σ called lexicographical order for example if σ = {0 1} string literals constants are called ‘anonymous
