world snippet from seminal book c programming language originates from brian kernighan bell laboratories more complex java source code example written object oriented programming style demonstrates boilerplate code with prologue comments indicated red inline comments indicated green program statements indicated blue computing source code any collection computer instructions possibly with comments written using human-readable programming language usually ordinary text source code program specially designed facilitate work computer programmers who specify actions be performed by computer mostly by writing source code source code often transformed by assembler compiler into binary machine code understood by computer machine code might then be stored for execution at later time alternatively source code may be interpreted thus immediately executed most application software distributed form that includes only executable files if source code were included would be useful user programmer system administrator any whom might wish study and/or modify program contents definitions history organization purposes legal aspects o licensing quality see also references external links definitions linux information project defines source code source code also referred source code version software originally written ie typed into computer by human plain text ie human readable alphanumeric characters notion source code may also be taken more broadly include machine code notations graphical languages neither which are textual nature example from article presented on annual ieee conference on source code analysis manipulation for purpose clarity ‘source code’ taken mean any fully executable description software system therefore so construed include machine code very high level languages executable graphical representations systems often there are several steps program translation minification between original source code typed by human executable program while some like fsf argue that intermediate file not real source code does not count source code others find convenient refer each intermediate file source code for next steps history earliest programs for stored-program computers were entered binary through front panel switches computer this first-generation programming language had no distinction between source code machine code when ibm first offered software work with its machine source code was provided at no additional charge at that time cost developing supporting software was included price hardware for decades ibm distributed source code with its software product licenses until most early computer magazines published source code type-in programs occasionally entire source code large program published hardback book such computers & typesetting volume b tex program pgp source code internals pc speedscript uc/os real-time kernel organization source code which constitutes program usually held one more text files stored on computer's hard disk usually these files are carefully arranged into directory tree known source tree source code can also be stored database common for stored procedures elsewhere source code for particular piece software may be contained single file many files though practice uncommon program's source code can be written different programming languages for example program written primarily c programming language might have portions written assembly language for optimization purposes also possible for some components piece software be written compiled separately arbitrary programming language later integrated into software using technique called library linking some languages such java this can be done at run time each class compiled into separate file that linked by interpreter at runtime yet another method make main program interpreter for programming language either designed specifically for application question general-purpose then write bulk actual user functionality macros other forms add-ins this language approach taken for example by gnu emacs text editor code base computer programming project larger collection all source code all computer programs which make up project has become common practice maintain code bases version control systems moderately complex software customarily requires compilation assembly several sometimes dozens even hundreds different source code files these cases instructions for compilations such makefile are included with source code these describe relationships among source code files contain information about how they are be compiled revision control system another tool frequently used by developers for source code maintenance purposes source code primarily used input process that produces executable program ie compiled interpreted also used method communicating algorithms between people eg code snippets books computer programmers often find helpful review existing source code learn about programming techniques sharing source code between developers frequently cited contributing factor maturation their programming skills some people consider source code expressive artistic medium porting software other computer platforms usually prohibitively difficult without source code without source code for particular piece software portability generally computationally expensive possible porting options include binary translation emulation original platform decompilation executable program can be used generate source code either assembly code high-level language programmers frequently adapt source code from one piece software use other projects concept known software reusability legal aspects see also history free open-source software before when us commission on new technological uses copyrighted works contu decided that computer programs extent that they embody author's original creation are proper subject matter copyright software its source code was not copyrightable therefore always public domain software apple v franklin legislation clarified also for object code that copyright act gave computer programs copyright status literary works united states court case bernstein v united states was decided if source code should be considered constitutionally protected form free speech proponents free speech argued that because source code conveys information programmers written language can be used share humor other artistic pursuits protected form communication university california mathematics professor cryptology specialist dan bernstein brought case court at time encryption algorithms were classified munitions by united states government exporting encryption other countries was considered issue national security had be approved by state department on bernstein's behalf electronic frontier foundation sued us government court ruling case declared software protected speech under first amendment national restrictions on encryption software were overturned licensing main article software license author non-trivial work like software has several exclusive rights among them copyright for source code object code author has right possibility grant customers users his software some his exclusive rights form software licensing software its accompanying source code can be associated with several licensing paradigms most important distinction open source vs proprietary software generally speaking software open source if source code free use distribute modify study proprietary if source code kept secret privately owned restricted one first software license be published explicitly grant these freedoms was gnu general public license bsd license another early example from for proprietary software provisions various copyright laws trade secrecy patents are used keep source code closed additionally many pieces retail software come with end-user license agreement eula which typically prohibits decompilation reverse engineering analysis modification circumventing copy protection types source code protection – beyond traditional compilation object code – include code encryption code obfuscation code morphing quality main article software quality way program written can have important consequences for its maintainers coding conventions which stress readability some language-specific conventions are aimed at maintenance software source code which involves debugging updating other priorities such speed program's execution ability compile program for multiple architectures often make code readability less important consideration since code quality generally depends on its purpose see also bytecode code data coding conventions legacy code machine code markup language obfuscated code object code open-source
