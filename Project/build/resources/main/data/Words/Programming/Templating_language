template processor from wikipedia free encyclopedia   redirected from templating language jump navigation search diagram illustrating all basic elements processing flow template engine template processor also known template engine template parser software designed combine one more templates with data model produce one more result documents language that templates are written known template language templating language for purposes this article result document any kind formatted output including documents web pages source code source code generation either whole fragments template engine ordinarily included part web template system application framework may be used also preprocessor filter contents typical features embedded template engines system elements o data model o source template o template engine o result documents uses o template engine o document generation o source code generation o software functionality comparison benefits using template engines see also references external links typical features template engines typically include features common most high-level programming languages with emphasis on features for processing plain text such features include variables functions text replacement file inclusion transclusion conditional evaluation loops embedded template engines while template processors are typically separate piece software used part system framework simple templating languages are commonly included string processing features general-purpose programming languages text processing programs notably text editors word processors templating languages are generally simple substitution-only languages contrast more sophisticated facilities full-blown template processors but may contain some logic simple examples include printf format strings found many programming languages snippets found number text editors source code editors word processors templates are common feature while automatic filling templates often referred mail merge illustrative example complementary nature parsing templating s substitute command sed text processor originating from search-and-replace ed text editor substitution commands are form s/regexp/replacement/ where regexp regular expression for parsing input replacement simple template for output either literal text format string containing characters & for entire match special escape sequences \1 through \9 for nth sub-expression for example s/cat|dogs/\1s/g replaces all occurrences cat dog with cats dogs without duplicating existing s cat|dog 1st only sub-expression regexp \1 format string substitutes this into output system elements all template processing systems consist at least these primary elements associated data model one more source templates processor template engine generated output form result documents data model this may be relational database source file such xml alternate format flat file database spreadsheet any other various sources preformatted data some template processing systems are limited types data that can be used others are designed for maximum flexibility allow many different types data source template source templates are traditionally specified according pre-existing programming language according specially-defined template language according features hosting software application according hybrid combination some all above template engine template engine responsible for connecting data model processing code specified source templates directing output specific pipeline text file stream additionally some template engines allow additional configuration options result documents these may consist entire document document fragment uses template processing used various contexts for different purposes specific purpose ordinarily contingent upon software application template engine use however flexibility template processing systems often enables unconventional uses for purposes not originally intended by original designers template engine template engine specific kind template processing module that exhibits all major features modern programming language term template engine evolved generalized description programming languages whose primary exclusive purpose was process templates data output text use this term most notably applied web development using web template system also applied other contexts well document generation document generation frameworks typically use template processing central model for generating documents source code generation source code generation tools support generation source code result documents from abstract data models eg uml relational data domain-specific enterprise data stores for particular application domains particular organizations simplifying production process for computer programmers software functionality web template engine processes web templates source data typically from relational database produce one more output web pages page fragments ordinarily included part web template system application framework currently template processing software most frequently used context development for web comparison further information comparison web template engines xslt template processing model designed by w3c designed primarily for transformations on xml data into web documents other output programming languages such perl python php ruby c java support template processing either natively through add-on libraries modules javaserver pages active server pages genshi for python eruby are examples template engines designed specifically for web application development moreover template processing sometimes included sub-feature software packages like text editors ides relational database management systems benefits using template engines encourages organization source code into operationally-distinct layers see eg mvc enhances productivity by reducing unnecessary reproduction effort enhances teamwork by allowing separation work based on skill-set eg artistic vs technical see also document automation document modelling domain-specific programming language glossary operating systems terms § templating
