machine code at runtime one way categorize different jit compilers by their compilation scope whereas method-based jit compilers translate one method at time machine code tracing jits use frequently executed loops their unit compilation tracing jits are based on assumptions that programs spend most their time some loops program hot loops subsequent loop iterations often take similar paths virtual machines that have tracing jit are often mixed-mode execution environments meaning that they have either interpreter method compiler addition tracing jit technical details tracing jit compiler goes through various phases at runtime first profiling information for loops collected after hot loop has been identified special tracing mode entered which records all executed operations that loop this sequence operations called trace trace then optimized compiled machine code trace when this loop executed again compiled trace called instead program counterpart these steps are explained detail following profiling phase goal profiling identify hot loops this often done by counting number iterations for every loop after count loop exceeds certain threshold loop considered be hot tracing mode entered tracing phase tracing phase execution loop proceeds normally but addition every executed operation recorded into trace recorded operations are often stored form intermediate representation tracing follows function calls which leads them being inlined into trace tracing continues until loop reaches its end jumps back start since trace recorded by following one concrete execution path loop later executions that trace can diverge from that path identify places where that can happen special guard instructions are inserted into trace one example for such place are if statements guard quick check determine whether original condition still true if guard fails execution trace aborted since tracing done during execution trace can be made contain runtime information eg type information this information can later be used optimization phase increase code efficiency optimization code-generation phase traces are easy optimize since they represent only one execution path which means that no control flow exists needs no handling typical optimizations include constant-subexpression elimination dead-code elimination register allocation invariant-code motion constant folding escape analysis after optimization trace turned into machine code similarly optimization this easy due linear nature traces execution after trace has been compiled machine code can be executed subsequent iterations loop trace execution continues until guard fails history whereas idea jits reaches back 1960s tracing jits have become used more often only recently first mention idea that similar today's idea tracing jits was was observed that compiled code could be derived from interpreter at run-time by simply storing actions performed during interpretation first implementation tracing dynamo software dynamic optimization system that capable transparently improving performance native instruction stream executes on processor do this native instruction stream interpreted until hot instruction sequence found for this sequence optimized version generated cached executed dynamo was later extended dynamorio one dynamorio-based project was framework for interpreter construction that combines tracing partial evaluation was used dynamically remove interpreter overhead from language implementations hotpathvm first tracing jit compiler for high-level language was developed this vm was capable dynamically identifying frequently executed bytecode instructions which are traced then compiled machine code using static single assignment ssa construction motivation for hotpathvm was have efficient jvm for resource constrained mobile devices another example tracing jit tracemonkey one mozilla’s javascript implementations for firefox tracemonkey compiles frequently executed loop traces dynamic language javascript at run-time specialize generated code for actual dynamic types occurring on each path another project that utilizes tracing jits pypy enables use tracing jits for language implementations that were written with pypy's translation toolchain thus improving performance any program that executed using that interpreter this possible by tracing interpreter itself instead program that executed by interpreter tracing jits have also been explored by microsoft spur project for their common intermediate language cil spur generic tracer for cil which can also be used trace through javascript implementation example trace consider following program that computes sum squares successive whole numbers until that sum exceeds def squarex return x x i = y = while true y += squarei if y > break i = i + trace for this program could look something like this loopstarti1 y1 i2 = intmuli1 i1 xx y2 = intaddy1 i2 y += ii b1 = intgty2 guardfalseb1 i3 = intaddi1 i = i+1 jumpi3 y2 note how function call square inlined into trace how if statement turned into guardfalse see also computer programming portal computing portal compiler dalvik software hotspot interpreter
