self-identification viability chronological list tape formats see also references external links open reels 105-inch diameter reel track tape initially magnetic tape for data storage was wound on 105-inch cm reels this de facto standard for large computer systems persisted through late 1980s tape cartridges cassettes were available early mid-1970s were frequently used with small computer systems with introduction ibm cartridge large computer systems started move away from open reel tapes towards cartridges univac magnetic tape was first used record computer data on eckert -mauchly univac i uniservo drive recording medium was thin metal strip 05-inch mm wide nickel-plated phosphor bronze recording density was characters per inch micrometre/character on eight tracks at linear speed in/s m/s yielding data rate characters per second eight tracks six were data one was parity track one was clock timing track making allowance for empty space between tape blocks actual transfer rate was around characters per second small reel mylar tape provided separation from metal tape read/write head ibm formats ibm computers from 1950s used ferrous-oxide coated tape similar that used audio recording ibm's technology soon became de facto industry standard magnetic tape dimensions were 05-inch mm wide wound on removable reels up inches mm diameter different tape lengths were available with feet m feet m on mil one half thickness being somewhat standard during 1980s longer tape lengths such feet m became available using much thinner pet film most tape drives could support maximum reel size inches mm so-called mini-reel was common for smaller data sets such for software distribution these were 7-inch cm reels often with no fixed length—the tape was sized fit amount data recorded on cost-saving measure early ibm tape drives such ibm ibm were mechanically sophisticated floor-standing drives that used vacuum columns buffer long u-shaped loops tape between active control powerful reel motors vacuum control these u-shaped tape loops fast start stop tape at tape-to-head interface could be achieved ms from stopped tape full speed inches per second m/s fast acceleration possible because tape mass vacuum columns small length tape buffered columns provides time spin high inertia reels when active two tape reels thus fed tape into pulled tape out vacuum columns intermittently spinning rapid unsynchronized bursts resulting visually striking action stock shots such vacuum-column tape drives motion were widely used represent computer movies television early half-inch tape had seven parallel tracks data along length tape allowing six-bit characters plus one bit parity written across tape this was known seven-track tape with introduction ibm system mainframe nine-track tapes were introduced support new 8-bit characters that used effective recording density increased over time common seven-track densities started at then finally cpi nine-track tapes had densities cpi this translates into about mb mb per standard length ft reel tape end file was designated by tape mark end tape by two tape marks physical beginning end usable tape was indicated by reflective adhesive strips aluminum foil at least partly due success s/360 resultant standardization on 8-bit character codes byte addressing nine-track tapes were very widely used throughout computer industry during 1970s 1980s dec format linctape its derivative dectape were variations on this round tape they were essentially personal storage medium tape was inches mm wide featured fixed formatting track which unlike standard tape made feasible read rewrite blocks repeatedly place linctapes dectapes had similar capacity data transfer rate diskettes that displaced them but their seek times were on order thirty seconds minute inter-record gap irg magnetic tape inches mm cartridges cassettes quarter-inch cartridges context magnetic tape term cassette usually refers enclosure that holds two reels with single span magnetic tape term cartridge more generic but frequently means single reel tape plastic enclosure type packaging large determinant load unload times well length tape that can be held tape drive that uses single reel cartridge has takeup reel drive while cassettes have take up reel cassette tape drive transport deck uses precisely controlled motors wind tape from one reel other passing read/write head does ibm data cartridge can hold up 10gib uncompressed different type tape cartridge has continuous loop tape wound on special reel that allows tape be withdrawn from center reel then wrapped up around edge this type similar cassette that there no take-up reel inside tape drive ibm hypertape drive introduced used cassette with inch cm wide tape capable holding million six-bit characters per cassette 1970s 1980s audio compact cassettes were frequently used inexpensive data storage system for home computers compact cassettes were logically well physically sequential they had be rewound read from start load data early cartridges were available before personal computers had affordable disk drives could be used random access devices automatically winding positioning tape albeit with access times many seconds most magnetic tape systems used reels fixed inside cartridge protect tape facilitate handling cartridge formats include dds/dat dlt lto with capacities tens thousands gigabytes technical details tape width medium width primary classification criterion for tape technologies half inch has historically been most common width tape for high capacity data storage many other sizes exist most were developed either have smaller packaging higher capacity recording method linear recording method also important way classify tape technologies generally falling into two categories linear linear method arranges data long parallel tracks that span length tape multiple tape heads simultaneously write parallel tape tracks on single medium this method was used early tape drives simplest recording method but has lowest data density linear serpentine variation on linear technology linear serpentine recording which uses more tracks than tape heads each head still writes one track at time after making pass over whole length tape all heads shift slightly make another pass reverse direction writing another set tracks this procedure repeated until all tracks have been read written by using linear serpentine method tape medium can have many more tracks than read/write heads compared simple linear recording using same tape length same number heads data storage capacity substantially higher scanning helical scanning recording methods write short dense tracks across width tape medium not along length tape heads are placed on drum disk which rapidly rotates while relatively slowly moving tape passes early method used get higher data rate than prevailing linear method was transverse scan this method spinning disk with tape heads embedded outer edge placed perpendicular path tape this method used ampex's dcrsi instrumentation data recorders old ampex quadruplex videotape system another early method was arcuate scan this method heads are on face spinning disk which laid flat against tape path tape heads makes arc helical scan recording writes short dense tracks diagonal manner this recording method used by virtually all videotape systems several data tape formats block layout typical format data written tape blocks with inter-block gaps between them each block written single operation with tape running continuously during write however since rate at which data written read tape drive not deterministic tape drive usually has cope with difference between rate at which data goes on off tape rate at which data supplied demanded by its host various methods have been used alone combination cope with this difference tape drive can be stopped backed up restarted known shoe-shining because increased wear both medium head large memory buffer can be used queue data host can assist this process by choosing appropriate block sizes send tape drive there complex tradeoff between block size size data buffer record/playback deck percentage tape lost on inter-block gaps read/write throughput finally modern tape drives offer speed matching feature where drive can dynamically decrease physical tape speed by much 50% avoid shoe-shining size inter-block gap constant while size data block based on number bytes block thus given length tape reel can hold much less data when written with smaller block sizes than with larger sequential access data tape characterized by sequential access data while tape can provide fast sequential data transfers takes tens seconds load cassette position tape head arbitrary place contrast hard disk technology can perform equivalent action tens milliseconds orders magnitude faster can be thought offering random access data logical filesystems require data metadata be stored on data storage medium storing metadata one place data another requires lots slow repositioning activity on most tape systems result most tape systems use very trivial filesystem which files are addressed by number not by filename metadata such file name modification time typically not stored at all tape labels store such metadata they are used for interchanging data between systems file archiver backup tools have been created pack multiple files along with related metadata into single 'tape file' serpentine tape drives eg qic can improve access time by switching appropriate track tape partitions were used for directory information linear tape file system method storing file metadata on separate part tape this makes possible copy paste files directories tape if were just like another disk but does not change fundamental sequential access nature tape access time tape has quite long latency for random accesses since deck must wind average one-third tape length move from one arbitrary data block another most tape systems attempt alleviate intrinsic long latency either using indexing where separate lookup table tape directory maintained which gives physical tape location for given data block number must for serpentine drives by marking blocks with tape mark that can be detected while winding tape at high speed data compression most tape drives now include some kind lossless data compression there are several algorithms which provide similar results lz most idrc exabyte aldc ibm qic dlz1 dlt embedded tape drive hardware these compress relatively small buffer data at time so cannot achieve extremely high compression even highly redundant data ratio typical with some vendors claiming ratio actually obtained with real data often less than stated figure compression ratio cannot be relied upon when specifying capacity equipment eg drive claiming compressed capacity 500gb may not be adequate back up 500gb real data data that already stored efficiently may not allow any significant compression sparse database may offer much larger factors software compression can achieve much better results with sparse data but uses host computer's processor can slow backup if unable compress fast data written compression algorithms used low-end products are not most effective known today better results can usually be obtained by turning off hardware compression using software compression encryption if desired instead plain text raw images database files txt ascii bmp dbf etc typically compress much better than other types data stored on computer systems contrast encrypted data pre-compressed data pgp zip jpeg mpeg mp3 etc would normally increase size if data compression was applied some cases this data expansion could be much 15% encryption standards exist encrypt tapes encryption used so that even if tape stolen thieves cannot use data on tape key management crucial maintain security encryption more efficient if done after compression encrypted data cannot be compressed effectively some enterprise tape drives can quickly encrypt data symmetric streaming encryption algorithms can also provide high performance cartridge memory self-identification some tape cartridges notably lto cartridges have small associated data storage chips built into cartridges that record metadata about tape such type encoding size storage dates other information it's also common for tape cartridges have bar codes on their labels order assist automated tape library viability medium large-sized data centers deploy both tape disk formats costs disk storage have decreased faster than that tapes until about end twentieth century prices capacities allowed backing up desktop hard drive tape more cheaply more compactly than backing up additional external removable drive drive prices offer capacities hundreds thousands megabytes on relatively inexpensive machines backing up external usb drive became cheaper drive more compact than tape for non-networked machine used by business serious user basic comparison mainframe-class tape drives such oracle's sun storagetek t10000b are priced at approximately us$37000 each excluding tape libraries ibm's ts1130 also representative this storage class at any single moment time each t10000c tape drive can read write both read write one tape cartridge which can contain up 5tb uncompressed data real-world sequential data transfer speeds are high sustained 240mb/second for t10000c 160mb/second for ts1130 compared disk however pc-class hard disks are priced below $200 for 3tb one mainframe-class hard disk still has much lower price than one mainframe-class tape drive so economics might favor disk however key difference that tape drives can exchange their magnetic media cartridges frequently while magnetic media installed inside each hard disk fixed cannot be swapped drives themselves could be moved if installed swappable caddies at extra cost with extra cost hot-swappable infrastructure mainframe-class tape drives are almost always installed robotic tape libraries which are often quite large can hold thousands cartridges storagetek sl8500 library one representative example smallest sl8500 library holds up tape cartridges for petabytes online uncompressed storage equivalent amount pc-class hard disk storage would be priced at $100000 less for drives tape library would likely deliver higher sustained sequential write speed media would be more rugged for off-site storage media would meet exceed long-term archival storage requirements for reliable retrieval decades into future data center power cooling requirements would be considerably lower economics this comparison are more complicated than single-spindle versus tape drive comparison whether tape's characteristics versus disk are useful not will depend on particular data center its data storage requirements what has tended happen recent years that amount data has grown exponentially with both disk especially tape participating growth early twenty-first century solid state storage encroached on disk's previous near-monopoly random access non-volatile data storage while disk pushed into tape's territory some extent particularly situations where sequential data access only relatively small part particular data center's storage
