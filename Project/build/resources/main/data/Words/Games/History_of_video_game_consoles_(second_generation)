peak era popularity innovation for medium early period saw launch several consoles various companies decided enter market later releases were direct response earlier consoles atari was dominant console for much second generation with other consoles such intellivision odyssey² colecovision also enjoying market share second generation had mixed legacy affected by video game crash atari was discontinued on january ending second generation duration between start 2nd generation start 3rd generation was seven years due long lifespan atari which was available from second generation longest generation so far some features that distinguished second generation consoles from first generation consoles include microprocessor-based game logic ai simulation computer-based opponents allowing for single-player gaming rom cartridges for storing games allowing any number different games be played on one console game playfields able span multiple flip-screen areas blocky simplistic-looking

housed cartridges that activate games already wired into console this method was soon replaced during move pong consoles where logic for one more games was hard-coded into microchips using discrete logic no additional games could be added by mid-1970s cartridges returned with move cpu-based consoles with games now consisting microprocessor-based code these games were burned onto rom chips mounted inside plastic cartridge casings that could be plugged into slots on console when cartridges were plugged general-purpose microprocessors consoles read cartridge memory ran whatever program was stored there rather than being confined small selection games included box consumers could now amass libraries game cartridges fairchild ves was world's first cpu-based video game console introducing cartridge-based game code storage format was released by fairchild semiconductor november when atari released their vcs next year fairchild quickly renamed fairchild channel f rca studio ii video game console made by rca that debuted january graphics studio ii games were black white resembled those earlier pong consoles their clones studio ii also did not have joysticks similar game controllers but instead used two ten button keypads that were built into console itself console was capable making simple beep sounds with slight variations tone length atari released its cpu-based console called video computer system vcs later called atari nine games were designed released for holiday season would quickly become—by far—the most popular early consoles bally astrocade was originally referred bally home library computer was released but was available only through mail order delays production meant that none units actually shipped until by this time machine had been renamed bally professional arcade this form sold mostly at computer stores had little retail exposure unlike atari vcs bally grew less interested arcade market decided sell off their consumer products division including development production game console they re-released unit with basic cartridge included for free this system was known bally computer system but was changed astrocade sold under this name until video game crash then disappeared around magnavox released its microprocessor based console odyssey² united states canada philips electronics released this same game console philips g7000 for european market although odyssey never became popular atari consoles managed sell several million units through philips had also designed more powerful interton vc console family eg advanced programmable video system before this activision was created by disgruntled former atari programmers was first third-party developer video games succeeding years many new developers would follow their lead next major entry was intellivision which was introduced by mattel though chronologically coming long before 16-bit era intellivision console contains unique processor with instructions that were bits wide allowing more instruction variety potential speed registers bits wide also features advanced sound chip which can deliver output through three distinct sound channels system's initial production run sold out shortly after its national launch intellivision was first system pose serious threat atari's dominance series tv advertisements featuring george plimpton demonstrated superiority intellivision's graphics sound those atari using side-by-side game comparisons nevertheless atari held exclusive rights most popular arcade game conversions day used this key segment support their older hardware market this game advantage difference price between machines meant that each year atari sold more units than intellivision lengthening its lead despite inferior graphics this need for price parity has influenced every console war since saw introduction four new consoles emerson arcadia vectrex colecovision atari vectrex was unique among home systems time featuring vector graphics its own self-contained display arcadia colecovision were even more powerful machines popularity early consoles was strongly influenced by ports arcade games atari was first with space invaders colecovision bundled nintendo's donkey kong early cartridges were kb roms for atari kb for intellivision this upper limit grew steadily from up kb for atari intellivision kb for colecovision bank switching technique that allowed two different parts program use same memory addresses was required for larger cartridges work atari carts got large 32k final run through bank switching contrast some arcadia family members eg palladium video-computer-game supported up kb without any need for bank switching game consoles high ram prices especially during early period second generation limited ram memory capacity systems tiny amount often less than kb although cartridge rom size limit grew steadily ram limit was part console itself all games had work within its constraints case especially constrained atari which had only bytes ram available console few late game cartridges contained special combined ram/rom chip thus adding another bytes ram inside cartridge itself by glut consoles over-hyped game releases low-quality games from new third-party developers less well-prepared than activision began appear overflowing shelf capacity toy stores partly due this surplus video game
