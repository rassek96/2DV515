gallery rifle-shaped device registered hit when pointed at light source such dot on television screen four shooting-based games were included with light gun development while working for military contractor loral electronics engineer ralph h baer was assigned build television set while doing so he had idea build something into television set that owner could control rather than only hooking up remote television station baer did not pursue idea but returned him august while waiting for bus baer then head equipment design division at military contractor sanders associates came up with concept using television play games next morning wrote up four-page proposal for us$20 game box that would plug into television screen play games on while commercial video game industry did not yet exist at that point very first electronic computer games had been developed at start 1950s by several early mainframe games had been developed for mainframe computers which were typically only found large academic research institutions proposal baer began by referring project using military terminology but by time he finished he was referring channel lp short for let's play proposed device would transmit signal that television set could tune into if were television channel baer described several games that could be played on channel lp had little do with typical military contracts sanders worked on rather than bring idea his bosses baer instead commandeered empty room assigned one his technicians bob tremblay work on with him by december initial prototype later christened tv game was completed which could display move vertical line on television screen baer demonstrated prototype sanders director research development herbert campman who hesitantly agreed fund for us$2000 labor us$500 for materials making official project brown box prototype baer spent next few months designing further prototypes february assigned technician bill harrison begin building project harrison spent next few months between other projects building out successive modifications prototype baer meanwhile collaborated with engineer bill rusch on design console including developing basis many games for system first game was developed by may two-player game where players repeatedly press button competition fill empty bucket water by june multiple games were completed for what was then second prototype box these included game where players controlled dots chasing each other light gun shooter game with plastic rifle baer demonstrated new prototype campman who enjoyed shooting game increased funding recommended baer demonstrate project senior management baer demonstrated console board who were largely uninterested though couple members were enthusiastic nevertheless ceo royden sanders authorized project be continued with aim selling licensing console commercial product by august baer harrison had completed third prototype machine but had found that even come near baer's initial aim us$20 $25 console would require so much be excluded that resulting console would not be very enjoyable baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for system make up for this he formally added bill rusch who had helped him come up with initial games for system project though pair found rusch difficult work with he soon proved his value team by coming up with way display three spots on screen at once rather than previous two proposing development ping pong game by november team now on their fourth prototype machine had ping pong game chasing game light gun game three types controllers joysticks for chase game rifle for light gun game three dial controller for ping pong game campman felt that system was advanced enough begin trying find manufacturer buy they had decided aim for selling rights produce console sanders was not business making selling commercial electronics odyssey was packaged with board game accessories like dice play money well game cards team first approached cable television industry prototype attracted attention teleprompter corporation who had seen during visit after few months talks cash-flow problems forced teleprompter back out april same economic downturn that caused teleprompter's problems caused financial difficulties at sanders well which put project on hold after fifth prototype was developed while simultaneously undergoing large-scale layoffs was picked up again september this time without rusch went through two more iterations resulting january seventh prototype known brown box due wood-grain stickers on casing with system now largely complete baer harrison were unsure who approach sell until sanders patent attorney recommended contacting television manufacturers baer demonstrated system several companies who all expressed enthusiasm only rca was willing purchase device however agreement could not be reached soon afterwards though rca executive bill enders left rca for magnavox convinced them look at console again three creators brown box again demonstrated device magnavox july they received tepid reaction from most executives but vice president marketing gerry martin was favor magnavox agreed produce console after long period negotiations two companies finally signed agreement january magnavox designed exterior machine re-engineered internals with some consultation from baer harrison they removed ability display color used only three dial controller changed system selecting games from dial separate game cards that modified console's circuitry when plugged into console at time color televisions were still seen luxury item ability show color would have added additional expense time spent dealing with fcc testing regulations internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due cost concerns these concerns were no longer valid by but magnavox did not have enough time redesign every internal component machine prior planned production start date magnavox named console first skill-o-vision while testing then released odyssey rifle game was turned into separately sold add-on game shooting gallery magnavox added paper money playing cards poker chips console go along with plastic overlays for games that enhanced primitive visuals new additions helped raise price console us$9995 baer was upset

employees whether magnavox produced consoles additionally odyssey product manager bob fritsche recalls selling units that year while baer recalls sales being closer baer has stated that he felt low initial sales were due high price—us$100 being equivalent us$569 2015—and because magnavox restricting sales their dealerships implying that device only worked with magnavox televisions other sources have stated that dealership salespeople would try mislead customers that effect order try sell more television sets magnavox assistant product planner don emry has noted that sales were line with original projections if not with production run according baer after initial holiday season magnavox considered dropping console but modest continuing demand following year convinced them manufacture additional units for holiday season selling them console was also released other countries australia belgium france germany greece israel italy soviet union spain switzerland united kingdom venezuela with different games international release was focused united kingdom with some non-english versions not released until late magnavox ran large advertising campaign for all their products with result that they sold odyssey units according baer magnavox discontinued console after according baer sold units total worldwide though statements by fritsche indicate may have been higher light gun peripheral sold units odyssey was discontinued magnavox released first successive dedicated consoles —consoles that could only play games built into system—in magnavox odyssey series odyssey odyssey

magnavox odyssey² ralph baer being given national medal technology february while showed potential video game consoles marked end early history video games beginning commercial video game industry odyssey not generally considered major commercial success magnavox produced no more games for console after rejected baer's proposals for add-on that would add sound games putting controller associated golf game console variants that would have been cheaper supported up four players while few clone systems were produced limited quantities multiple dedicated consoles—generally focused on ping pong game variants—were created by several companies no other true home video consoles were produced until fairchild semiconductor channel f ralph baer was awarded national medal technology for

developed pong which bushnell recognized potential hit became company's first game pong was very successful turn helped drive sales odyssey baer once noted that customers bought console because table tennis turn because pong joked that they may well have stopped designing games after that game card however magnavox sued atari along with several competitors including nutting allied leisure bally midway williams electronics for infringing on baer's patents for video games played on television screen baer has stated that lawsuits were not filed right away because magnavox sanders needed wait
