video gaming did not reach mainstream popularity until 1970s 1980s when video arcade games gaming consoles using joysticks buttons other controllers along with graphics on computer screens home computer games were introduced general public since 1980s video gaming has become popular form entertainment part modern popular culture most parts world one early games was spacewar which was developed by computer scientists early arcade video games developed from during 1970s first generation home consoles emerged including popular game pong various clones 1970s was also era mainframe computer games golden age arcade video games was from video arcades with large graphics-decorated coin-operated machines were common at malls popular affordable home consoles such atari intellivision

early history video games defining video game term video game has evolved over decades from purely technical definition general concept defining new class interactive entertainment technically for product be video game there must be video signal transmitted cathode ray tube crt that creates rasterized image on screen this definition would preclude early computer games that outputted results printer teletype rather than display any game rendered on vector-scan monitor any game played on modern high definition display most handheld game systems from technical standpoint these would more properly be called electronic games computer games today however term video game has completely shed its purely technical definition encompasses wider range technology while still rather ill-defined term video game now generally encompasses any game played on hardware built with electronic logic circuits that incorporates element interactivity outputs results player's actions display going by this broader definition first video games appeared early 1950s were tied largely research projects at universities large corporations origins computer game first electronic digital computers colossus eniac were built during world war ii aid allied war effort against axis powers shortly after war promulgation first stored program architectures at university pennsylvania edvac cambridge university edsac university manchester manchester mark princeton university ias machine allowed computers be easily reprogrammed undertake variety tasks which facilitated commercializing computers early 1950s by companies like remington rand ferranti ibm this turn promoted adoption computers by universities government organizations large corporations decade progressed was this environment that first video games were born computer games 1950s can generally be divided into three categories training instructional programs research programs fields such artificial intelligence demonstration programs intended impress entertain public because these games were largely developed on unique hardware time when porting between systems was difficult were often dismantled discarded after serving their limited purposes they did not generally influence further developments industry for same reason impossible be certain who developed first computer game who originally modeled many games play mechanics introduced during decade there are likely several games from this period that were never publicized are thus unknown today earliest known written computer game was chess simulation developed by alan turing david champernowne called turochamp which was completed but never actually implemented on computer earliest known computer games actually implemented were two custom built machines called bertie brain nimrod which played tic-tac-toe game nim respectively bertie brain designed built by josef kates at rogers majestic was displayed at canadian national exhibition while nimrod conceived by john bennett at ferranti built by raymond stuart-williams was displayed at festival britain berlin industrial show neither game incorporated cathode ray tube crt display first games known incorporate monitor were two research projects completed checkers program by christopher strachey on ferranti mark tic-tac-toe program called oxo by alexander douglas on edsac both these programs used relatively static display track current state game board first known game incorporating graphics that updated real time was pool game programmed by william brown ted lewis specifically for demonstration midsac computer at university michigan tennis for two – modern recreation perhaps first game created solely for entertainment rather than demonstrate power some technology train personnel aid research was tennis for two designed by william higinbotham built by robert dvorak at brookhaven national laboratory designed entertain general public at brookhaven's annual series open houses game was deployed on analog computer with graphics displayed on oscilloscope was dismantled higinbotham never considered adapting successful game into commercial product which would have been impractical with technology time ultimately widespread adoption computers play games would have wait for machines spread from serious academics their students on us college campuses spacewar main article early mainframe games mainframe computers 1950s were generally batch processing machines limited speed memory this made them generally unsuited for games furthermore they were costly relatively scarce commodities so computer time was precious resource that could not be wasted on frivolous pursuits like entertainment at lincoln laboratory at massachusetts institute technology mit however team led by jay forrester developed computer called whirlwind early 1950s that processed commands real time incorporated faster more reliable form random access memory ram based around magnetic cores based on this work two employees at lab named ken olsen wes clark developed prototype real time computer called tx-0 that incorporated recently invented transistor which ultimately allowed size cost computers be significantly reduced olsen subsequently established digital equipment corporation dec with harlan anderson developed commercial update tx-0 called pdp-1 lincoln laboratory donated tx-0 mit computer operated real time thus allowed for interactive programming mit allowed students program computer conduct their own research perhaps first time that university students were allowed directly access computer for their own work further university decided allow students set computer tasks outside bounds classwork faculty research during periods time no one was signed up do official work this resulted community undergraduate students led by bob saunders peter samson alan kotok many them affiliated with tech model railroad club conducting their own experiments on computer mit received one first pdp-1 computers which incorporated relatively sophisticated point-plotting monitor mit provided similar level access computer for students did for tx-0 resulting creation first relatively widespread thus influential computer game spacewar spacewar credited first widely available influential computer game conceived by steve russell martin graetz wayne wiitanen programmed primarily by russell saunders graetz samson dan edwards first half spacewar was inspired by science fiction stories e e smith depicted duel between two spaceships each controlled by player using custom built control box immensely popular among students at mit spacewar spread west coast later year when russell took job at stanford artificial intelligence laboratory sail where enjoyed similar success program subsequently migrated other locations around country through efforts both former mit students dec itself more so after cathode ray tube crt terminals started becoming more common at end 1960s computing resources continued expand over remainder decade through adoption time sharing development simpler high-level programming languages like basic increasing number college students began programming sharing simple sports puzzle card logic board games decade progressed these creations remained trapped computer labs for remainder decade however because even though some adherents spacewar had begun sense commercial possibilities computer games they could only run on hardware costing hundreds thousands dollars computers their components continued fall price however dream commercial video game finally became attainable at start 1970s commercialization video games by introduction medium scale integration msi transistor–transistor logic ttl circuits combining multiple transistors on single microchip had resulted another significant reduction cost computing ushered new wave minicomputers costing under $10000 while still far too costly for home these advances lowered cost computing enough that could be seriously considered for coin-operated games industry which at time was experiencing its own technological renaissance large electro-mechanical target shooting driving games like sega enterprises's periscope chicago coin's speedway pioneered adoption elaborate visual displays electronic sound effects amusement arcade consequently when recent engineering graduate from utah with experience running coin-operated equipment named nolan bushnell first saw spacewar at sail late early he resolved build coin-operated version for public consumption enlisting aid older more experienced engineer named ted dabney bushnell built variant game called computer space which single player-controlled spaceship dueled two hardware-controlled flying saucers released late november early december through nutting associates game failed have much impact coin-operated marketplace magnavox odyssey first home console meanwhile ralph baer engineer with degree television engineering working for defense contractor sanders associates had been working on video game system that could be plugged into standard television set since working primarily with technician bill harrison who built most actual hardware baer developed series prototype systems between based around diode–transistor logic dtl circuits that would send video signal television set generate spots on screen that could be controlled by players originally able generate only two spots system was modified november at suggestion engineer bill rusch generate third spot for use table tennis game which each player controlled single spot that served paddle volleyed third spot which acted ball sanders concluded licensing agreement with television company magnavox release system which reached market september magnavox odyssey system launched with dozen games included box four more sold with separate light gun six games sold separately most which were chase racing target shooting sports games these games were activated using plug-in circuit cards that defined how spots generated by hardware would behave due limited abilities system which could only render three spots line most graphic gameplay elements were actually defined by plastic overlays attached tv set along with accessories like boards cards dice like computer space odyssey only performed modestly failed jump start new industry however system did directly influence birth vibrant video arcade game industry after ralph baer's design ingenuity intersected nolan bushnell's entrepreneurial ambition new industry early arcade video games 1972–1978 see also arcade game first generation video game consoles pong was first arcade game ever receive universal acclaim nolan bushnell ted dabney decided strike out on their own incorporated their preexisting partnership atari after seeing demonstration magnavox odyssey ahead its release bushnell charged new hire allan alcorn create version that system's table tennis game practice project familiarize himself with video game design alcorn's version ended up being so fun that atari decided release pong available limited quantities late pong began reaching market quantity march after which ignited new craze for ball-and-paddle video games coin-operated amusement industry success pong did not result displacement traditional arcade amusements like pinball but did lay foundation for successful video arcade game industry roughly video games mostly ball-and-paddle variants were sold by combination recent startups like atari ramtek allied leisure established chicago firms like williams chicago coin midway subsidiary bally manufacturing video arcade game market remained state flux for remainder decade ball-and-paddle market collapsed due market saturation which led significant drop video game sales smaller manufacturers attempted compensate by creating cocktail table cabinets for sale non-traditional venues like higher class restaurants lounges but this market failed fully develop larger companies like atari midway turned new genres remain successful especially racing games one-on-one dueling games target shooting games early hits these genres included gran trak tank from atari wheels gun fight sea wolf from midway wheels gun fight were licensed versions speed race western gun developed by taito trading company japan marking start japanese video game penetration into united states gun fight was also one first arcade games incorporate microprocessor starting shift away from video arcade games engineered using dedicated ttl hardware video games programmed software video game was one several concepts that helped reform image arcade seedy hangout for delinquents this turn aided growth arcades suburban shopping malls principle pioneer shopping mall arcade was jules millman who established arcade shopping mall harvey illinois by banning eating drinking smoking maintaining full staff at all times keep eye on facilities millman created safe environment where parents could feel safe leaving their older children while browsing other stores mall millman founded american amusements establish more shopping mall arcades which was purchased by bally renamed aladdin's castle other entrepreneur's imitated millman's format arcades became mainstay shopping mall by end decade emergence solid state pinball late 1970s which electro-mechanical technologies like relays were replaced by newly emerging microprocessor temporarily stole limelight from video games which once again entered period decline while individual games like atari's breakout cinematronics' space wars sold large numbers during this period overall profitability began lag market surged once again however after introduction taito game space invaders by midway first generation home consoles pong clones 1972–1978 magnavox's odyssey game console magnavox odyssey never caught on with public due largely limited functionality its primitive technology by middle 1970s however ball-and-paddle craze arcade had ignited public interest video games continuing advances integrated circuits had resulted large-scale integration lsi microchips cheap enough be incorporated into consumer product magnavox reduced part count odyssey using three-chip set created by texas instruments released two new systems that only played ball-and-paddle games odyssey odyssey atari meanwhile entered consumer market that same year with single-chip home pong system designed by harold lee next year general instrument released pong-on-a-chip lsi made available at low price any interested company toy company coleco industries used this chip create million-selling telstar console model series 1976–77 while dozens other companies released models well overall sales dedicated ball-and-paddle systems us grew from peak 5–6 million similar boom hit united kingdom other parts europe with much market supplied by clone manufacturers hong kong after dedicated console market united states collapsed new wave programmable systems hit market starting with fairchild channel f that offered possibility purchasing playing wider variety games stored on cartridges containing mask rom that could be plugged directly into cpu console older model dedicated consoles were heavily discounted consumers with more purchasing power transitioned new programmable systems newer dedicated systems with more advanced features like video pinball from atari odyssey were squeezed out by their lower priced predecessors their more sophisticated programmable replacements this caused brief dip market exit industry leader coleco which failed transition programmable hardware fairchild remained new programmable market alongside atari magnavox which released vcs odyssey2 respectively mainframe computer games 1971–1979 on-screen instructions from will crowther's game colossal cave adventure 1960s number computer games were created for mainframe minicomputer systems but these failed achieve wide distribution due continuing scarcity computer resources lack sufficiently trained programmers interested crafting entertainment products difficulty transferring programs between computers different geographic areas by end 1970s however situation had changed drastically basic c high-level programming languages were widely adopted during decade which were more accessible than earlier more technical languages such fortran cobol opening up computer game creation larger base users with advent time-sharing which allowed resources single mainframe be parceled out among multiple users connected machine by terminals computer access was no longer limited handful individuals at institution creating more opportunities for students create their own games furthermore widespread adoption pdp-10 released by digital equipment corporation dec portable unix operating system developed at bell labs released generally created common programming environments across country that reduced difficulty sharing programs between institutions finally founding first magazines dedicated computing like creative computing publication earliest program compilation books like basic computer games spread wide-area networks such arpanet allowed programs be shared more easily across great distances result many mainframe games created by college students 1970s influenced subsequent developments video game industry ways that spacewar aside games 1960s did not arcade on home consoles fast-paced action real-time gameplay were norm genres like racing target shooting on mainframe however such games were generally not possible due both lack adequate displays many computer terminals continued rely on teletypes rather than monitors well into 1970s even most crt terminals could only render character-based graphics insufficient processing power memory update game elements real time while 1970s mainframes were more powerful than arcade console hardware period need parcel out computing resources dozens simultaneous users via time-sharing significantly hampered their abilities thus programmers mainframe games focused on strategy puzzle-solving mechanics over pure action notable games period include tactical combat game star trek by mike mayfield hide-and-seek game hunt wumpus by gregory yob strategic war game empire by walter bright perhaps most significant game period was colossal cave adventure simply adventure created by will crowther by combining his passion for caving with concepts from newly released tabletop role-playing game rpg dungeons dragons d&d expanded by don woods with emphasis on high fantasy jrr tolkien adventure established new genre based around exploration inventory-based puzzle solving that made transition personal computers late 1970s while most games were created on hardware limited graphic ability one computer able host more impressive games was plato system developed at university illinois intended educational computer system connected hundreds users all over united states via remote terminals that featured high-quality plasma displays allowed users interact with each other real time this allowed system host impressive array graphical and/or multiplayer games including some earliest known computer rpgs which were primarily derived like adventure from d&d but unlike that game placed greater emphasis on combat character progression than puzzle solving starting with top-down dungeon crawls like dungeon game dungeons more commonly referred today by their filenames pedit5 dnd plato rpgs soon transitioned first-person perspective with games like moria oubliette avatar which often allowed multiple players join forces battle monsters complete quests together like adventure these games would ultimately inspire some earliest personal computer games golden age golden age arcade video games 1978–1982 main article golden age arcade video games space invaders was popular game during golden age game introduced many elements which would become standard video games by video games were well established us coin-operated amusement industry but their popularity was secondary industry stalwarts pool pinball that changed with introduction new game developed japan while video games had been introduced japan soon after hitting united states japanese arcade industry had remained primarily focused on electro-mechanical driving shooting games type slot machine called medal game that accepted paid out medals instead currency so not be classified gambling game arrival breakout distributed locally by nakamura manufacturing company advent table-top game units pioneered by taito created new demand for video games snack bars tea houses taito designer tomohiro nishikado decided build on popularity breakout by replacing paddle game with gun battery bricks game with rows aliens that would descend line-by-line while firing at player taito released this game space invaders games such galaxian galaga donkey kong were popular arcades during early 1980s space invaders introduced popularized several important concepts arcade video games including play regulated by lives instead timer set score gaining extra lives through accumulating points tracking high score achieved on machine was also first game confront player with waves targets that would shoot back at player first include background music during game play simple four-note loop with its intense game play competitive scoring features space invaders became national phenomenon over invader games—counting clones knockoffs—entered japanese game centers by middle while not quite popular united states space invaders became biggest hit industry had seen since great depression midway serving north american manufacturer moved over cabinets one-two punch space invaders atari game asteroids which moved units popularized recording multiple high scores table resulted video arcade games completely displacing pinball other amusements become central attraction not just shopping mall arcade but also variety street locations from convenience stores bowling alleys pizza parlors many best-selling games such galaxian defender missile command tempest galaga focused on shooting mechanics achieving high scores starting with pac man which sold units united states new wave games appeared that focused on identifiable characters alternate mechanics such navigating maze traversing series platforms aside from pac man its sequel ms pac-man most popular games this vein were donkey kong qbert according trade publication vending times revenues generated by coin-operated video games on location united states jumped from $308 million $968 million $28 billion pac man ignited even larger video game craze attracted more female players arcades revenues jumped again $49 billion according trade publication play meter by july total coin-op collections peaked at $89 billion which $77 billion came from video games meanwhile number arcades—defined any location with ten more games—more than doubled between july july from over just over these figures made arcade games most popular entertainment medium country far surpassing both pop music at $4 billion sales per year hollywood films $3 billion second generation consoles 1976–1982 main article second generation video game consoles intellivision was home console system introduced after collapse dedicated console market focus home shifted new programmable systems which game data was stored on rom-based cartridges fairchild semiconductor struck first this market with channel f but after losing millions digital watch business company took conservative approach programmable console market kept production runs system low result by end fairchild had only sold about systems atari followed fairchild into market sold between systems that year magnavox joined programmable market with odyssey2 while toy company mattel released intellivision which had superior graphics any its competitors after both atari fairchild made strong showing market hit difficult patch when retailers resisted building inventory believing that newly emerging electronic handheld market would displace video games atari for example manufactured systems but proved unable sell more than retail this helped precipitate crisis at company that saw co-founder chairman nolan bushnell president joe keenan forced out by atari's parent company warner communications which had purchased atari largely on potential vcs ultimately home video games did well holiday season retailers proved more amenable stocking them again new atari ceo ray kassar subsequently harnessed his company's leftover stock help transform video game consoles into year-round product rather than something just purchased by retailers for sale during holiday season real breakthrough for home video game market occurred when atari released conversion popular space invaders game for vcs which was licensed from taito buoyed by success game atari's consumer sales almost doubled from $119 million nearly $204 million then exploded over $841 million while sales across entire video game industry united states rose from $1857 million just over $1 billion through combination conversions its own arcade games like missile command asteroids licensed conversions like defender atari took commanding lead industry with estimated 65% market share worldwide industry by dollar volume by mattel settled into second place with roughly 15%-20% market while magnavox ran distant third fairchild exited market entirely early days programmable market all games for given system were developed by firm that released console that changed when four atari programmers seeking greater recognition financial reward for their contributions struck out on their own form activision first third-party developer company went on develop string hits including kaboom river raid pitfall recognized one foundational games scrolling platformer genre another group atari employees joined with ex-mattel staff form imagic experienced success with games like demon attack atlantis atari released more advanced console based on its 8-bit computer line atari which failed perform well its predecessor that same year coleco returned video game market with new console colecovision that featured near-arcade-quality graphics shipped with port popular arcade game donkey kong coleco sold out its entire run units holiday season overall us video game sales reached $21 billion which represented 31% dollar volume entire toy industry ultimately however rapid growth home console market could not be sustained industry soon faced serious downturn that nearly wiped out early home computer games 1976–1982 while fruit retail development early video games appeared mainly video arcades home consoles home computers began appearing late 1970s were rapidly evolving 1980s allowing their owners program simple games hobbyist groups for new computers soon formed pc game software followed soon many these games—at first clones mainframe classics such star trek then later ports clones popular arcade games such space invaders frogger pac-man see pac-man clones donkey kong—were being distributed through variety channels such printing game’s source code books such david ahl’s basic computer games magazines creative computing newsletters which allowed users type code for themselves early game designers like crowther daglow yob would find computer code for their games—which they had never thought copyright—published books magazines with their names removed from listings early home computers from apple commodore tandy others had many games that people typed games were also distributed by physical mailing selling floppy disks cassette tapes rom cartridges soon small cottage industry was formed with amateur programmers selling disks plastic bags put on shelves local shops sent through mail richard garriott distributed several copies his role-playing video game akalabeth world doom plastic bags before game was published 1980s main article 1980s video gaming video games industry experienced its first major growing pains early 1980s publishing houses appeared with many businesses surviving 20+ years such electronic arts—alongside fly-by-night operations that cheated games' developers while some early 1980s games were simple clones existing arcade titles relatively low publishing costs for personal computer games allowed for bold unique games gaming computers following success apple ii commodore pet late 1970s series cheaper incompatible rivals emerged early 1980s this second batch included commodore vic-20 sinclair zx80 zx81 zx spectrum nec pc-8000 pc-6001 pc-88 pc-98 sharp x1 x68000 atari 8-bit family bbc micro acorn electron amstrad cpc msx series these rivals helped catalyze both home computer game markets by raising awareness computing gaming through their competing advertising campaigns sinclair acorn amstrad offerings were generally only known europe africa nec sharp offerings were generally only known asia msx had base north south america europe asia while us-based apple commodore atari offerings were sold both us europe games dominated home computers' software libraries compendium reviews atari 8-bit software used pages for games compared for all others by that year computer gaming market took over from console market following crash that year computers offered equal gaming ability since their simple design allowed games take complete command hardware after power-on they were nearly simple start playing with consoles commodore system commodore was released public august found initial success because was marketed priced aggressively had basic programming environment advanced graphic sound abilities for its time similar colecovision console also used same game controller ports popularized by atari allowing gamers use their old joysticks with system would become most popular home computer its day usa many other countries best-selling single computer model all time internationally at around same time sinclair zx spectrum was released united kingdom quickly became most popular home computer many areas western europe—and later eastern bloc—due ease with which clones could be produced sid meier listed ibm pc one three most important innovations history video games ibm pc compatible platform became technically competitive gaming platform with ibm’s pc/at primitive cga graphics prior models with only 4-color 320×200 pixel graphics using special programming 16-color 160×100 graphics had limited pc’s appeal business segment its graphics failed compete with c64 apple ii new 64-color enhanced graphics adapter ega display standard allowed its graphics approach quality seen popular home computers like commodore however sound abilities at were still limited pc speaker which was substandard compared built-in sound chips used many home computers also relatively high cost pc compatible systems severely limited their popularity gaming apple macintosh also arrived at this time lacked color abilities earlier apple ii instead preferring much higher pixel resolution but operating system support for graphical user interface gui attracted developers some games eg lode runner even before color returned with mac ii arrival atari st commodore amiga was start new era 16-bit machines for many users they were too costly until later on decade at which point advances ibm pc’s open platform had caused ibm pc compatibles become comparably powerful at lower cost than their competitors vga standard developed for new ibm personal system/2 ps/2 line gave pc potential for 256-color graphics this was big jump ahead most 8-bit home computers but still lagged behind platforms with built-in sound graphics hardware like amiga this caused odd trend around '89–91 toward developing for seemingly inferior machine thus while both st amiga were host many technically excellent games their time prominence was shorter than that 8-bit machines which saw new ports well into 1980s even 1990s yamaha ym3812 sound chip dedicated sound cards started address issue poor sound abilities ibm pc compatibles late 1980s ad lib set early de facto standard for sound cards with its card based on yamaha ym3812 sound chip this would last until introduction creative labs' sound blaster which took chip added new features while remaining compatible with ad lib cards creating new de facto standard however many games would still support these rarer things like roland mt-32 disney sound source into early 1990s initial high cost sound cards meant they would not find widespread use until 1990s shareware gaming first appeared mid-1980s but its big successes came 1990s early online gaming see also history massively multiplayer online games dial-up bulletin board systems were popular 1980s sometimes used for online game playing earliest such systems were late 1970s early 1980s had crude plain-text interface later systems made use terminal-control codes so-called ansi art which included use ibm-pc-specific characters not part american national standards institute ansi standard get pseudo-graphical interface some bbss offered access various games which were playable through such interface ranging from text adventures gambling games like blackjack generally played for points rather than real money on some multiuser bbss where more than one person could be online at once there were games allowing users interact with one another snipes was credited for popularizing genre many online games superset software created snipes text-mode networked computer game test new ibm personal computer–based computer network demonstrate its abilities snipes officially credited being original inspiration for netware believed be first network game ever written for commercial personal computer recognized alongside game maze war networked multiplayer maze game for several research machines spasim multiplayer space simulation for time shared mainframes precursor multiplayer games such 1987's midi maze doom idoom later kalinet was created for games that only allowed local network play connect over internet other services such kahn ten mplayer heatnet soon followed after these services ultimately became obsolete when game producers began including their own online software such battlenet won later steam first user interfaces were plain-text—similar bbss— but they operated on large mainframe computers permitting larger numbers users be online at once by end decade inline services had fully graphical environments using software specific each personal computer platform popular text-based services included compuserve source genie while platform-specific graphical services included playnet quantum link for commodore applelink for apple ii macintosh pc link for ibm pc—all which were run by company which eventually became america online—and competing service prodigy interactive games were feature these services though until they used text-based displays not graphics handheld lcd games milton bradley company released first handheld system using interchangeable cartridges microvision while handheld received modest success first year production lack games screen size video game crash brought about system's quick demise nintendo released its game & watch line handheld electronic game which spurred dozens other game toy companies make their own portable games many which were copies game & watch titles adaptations popular arcade games improving lcd technology meant new handhelds could be more reliable consume fewer batteries than led vfd games most only needing watch batteries they could also be made much smaller than most led handhelds even small enough wear on one’s wrist like watch tiger electronics borrowed this concept videogaming with cheap affordable handhelds still produces games this model present day video game crash main article north american video game crash at end industry experienced severe downturn this was crash video game industry bankrupted several companies that produced north american consoles games from late early ended what considered be second generation console video gaming main causes crash were market flooded with poor-quality games partly because loss control over third party developers commercial failure important atari titles home computers emerging new more advanced gaming platform making consoles quickly unpopular obsolete effects results crash include atari video game burial burial by atari thousands unsold returned consoles games new mexico rise globally important video gaming industry japan creating important rooms for companies like nintendo sega worldwide popularity third-generation nintendo entertainment system for which third-party game publishing was strictly overseen by nintendo third generation consoles 1983–1995 8-bit main article third generation video game consoles nintendo entertainment system nes whilst broken gaming industry us takes several local businesses bankruptcy practically ends retail interest video gaming products 8-bit third generation video game consoles starts japan early with release both nintendo's family computer famicom sega's sg-1000 on july first clearly trumps second terms commercial success country causing sega replace two years later by severely improved modernized version called sega mark iii efforts make famicom marketable us nintendo creates completely redesigned version called nintendo entertainment system nes be sold country something unrelated video gaming for this same reason company also developed toy robot accessory called rob be sold together with some versions nes then released on october us reviving video game market country proving successful american audience peaking popularity between early 1990s console was later released other western countries but because heavy competition from home computers such zx spectrum amstrad cpc commodore lack marketing nes was prevented from having much success europe sega mark iii released western consumers master system dominated markets europe oceania brazil selling more than nes these regions soon famicom/nes master system became great consoles third generation while sega focused on unique gameplay experiences innovative technology with master system's superior technical properties which allowed better graphics accessories like lcd glasses nintendo focused on creating long popular game franchises which often repeated same features despite different regional dominances famicom/nes sold superior sum million worldwide copies against million master system this generation gamepad joypad took over for joysticks paddles keypads default game controller gamepad design direction directional-pad d-pad for short with more action buttons became standard this generation also marked shift dominance home video game console hardware console game production from united states japan third console generation marked debut various high-profile role-playing franchises such legend zelda dragon
