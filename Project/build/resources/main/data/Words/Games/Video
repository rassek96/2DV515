first developed for mechanical television systems which were quickly replaced by cathode ray tube crt television systems but several new technologies for video display devices have since been invented video was originally exclusively live technology charles ginsburg led ampex research team developing one first practical video tape recorder vtr first video tape recorder captured live images from television cameras by converting camera's electrical impulses saving information onto magnetic video tape video recorders were sold for $50000 videotapes cost $300 per one-hour reel however prices gradually dropped over years sony began selling videocassette recorder vcr decks tapes into consumer market use digital techniques video created digital video which allowed higher quality eventually much lower cost than earlier analog technology after invention dvd blu-ray disc sales videotape recording equipment plummeted advances computer technology allowed even inexpensive personal computers capture store edit transmit digital video further reducing cost video production allowing program-makers broadcasters move tapeless production advent digital broadcasting subsequent digital television transition process relegating analog video status legacy technology most parts world with increasing use high-resolution video cameras with improved dynamic range color gamuts high-dynamic-range digital intermediate data formats with improved color depth modern digital video technology slowly converging with digital film technology characteristics video streams number frames per second frame rate number still pictures per unit time video ranges from six eight frames per second frame/s for old mechanical cameras more frames per second for new professional cameras pal standards europe asia australia etc secam france russia parts africa etc specify frame/s while ntsc standards usa canada japan etc specify frames film shot at slower frame rate frames per second which slightly complicates process transferring cinematic motion picture video minimum frame rate achieve comfortable illusion moving image about sixteen frames per second interlaced vs progressive video can be interlaced progressive interlacing was invented way reduce flicker early mechanical crt video displays without increasing number complete frames per second which would have sacrificed image detail remain within limitations narrow bandwidth horizontal scan lines each complete frame are treated if numbered consecutively captured two fields odd field upper field consisting odd-numbered lines even field lower field consisting even-numbered lines analog display devices reproduce each frame same way effectively doubling frame rate far perceptible overall flicker concerned when image capture device acquires fields one at time rather than dividing up complete frame after captured frame rate for motion effectively doubled well resulting smoother more lifelike reproduction although with halved detail rapidly moving parts image when viewed on interlaced crt display but display such signal on progressive scan device problematic ntsc pal secam are interlaced formats abbreviated video resolution specifications often include i indicate interlacing for example pal video format often specified 576i50 where indicates total number horizontal scan lines i indicates interlacing indicates fields half-frames per second progressive scan systems each refresh period updates all scan lines each frame sequence when displaying natively progressive broadcast recorded signal result optimum spatial resolution both stationary moving parts image when displaying natively interlaced signal however overall spatial resolution degraded by simple line doubling—artifacts such flickering comb effects moving parts image appear unless special signal processing eliminates them procedure known deinterlacing can optimize display interlaced video signal from analog dvd satellite source on progressive scan device such lcd television digital video projector plasma panel deinterlacing cannot however produce video quality that equivalent true progressive scan source material aspect ratio comparison common cinematography traditional television green aspect ratios aspect ratio describes dimensions video screens video picture elements all popular video formats are rectilinear so can be described by ratio between width height screen aspect ratio traditional television screen about high definition televisions use aspect ratio about aspect ratio full mm film frame with soundtrack also known academy ratio pixels on computer monitors are usually square but pixels used digital video often have non-square aspect ratios such those used pal ntsc variants ccir digital video standard corresponding anamorphic widescreen formats therefore by pixel ntsc dv image displayes with aspect ratio traditional television standard if pixels are thin displays at aspect ratio anamorphic widescreen format if pixels are fat popularity viewing video on mobile phones has led growth vertical video mary meeker partner at silicon valley venture capital firm kleiner perkins caufield & byers highlighted growth

square color space bits per pixel example u-v color plane y value=05 color model name describes video color representation yiq was used ntsc television corresponds closely yuv scheme used ntsc pal television ydbdr scheme used by secam television number distinct colors pixel can represent depends on number bits per pixel bpp common way reduce amount data required digital video by chroma subsampling eg 420/411 because human eye less sensitive details color than brightness luminance data for all pixels maintained while chrominance data averaged for number pixels block that same value used for all them for example this results 50% reduction chrominance data using pixel blocks 75% using pixel blocks420 this process does not reduce number possible color values that can be displayed reduces number distinct points at which color changes video quality video quality can be measured with formal metrics like psnr with subjective video quality using expert observation subjective video quality video processing system evaluated follows choose video sequences src use for testing choose settings system evaluate hrc choose test method for how present video sequences experts collect their ratings invite sufficient number experts preferably not fewer than carry out testing calculate average marks for each hrc based on experts' ratings many subjective video quality methods are

rates impaired video using scale ranging from impairments are imperceptible impairments are very annoying video compression method digital only main article video compression uncompressed video delivers maximum quality but with very high data rate variety methods are used compress video streams with most effective ones using group pictures gop reduce spatial temporal redundancy broadly speaking spatial redundancy reduced by registering differences between parts single frame this task known intraframe compression closely related image compression likewise temporal redundancy can be reduced by registering differences between frames this task known interframe compression including motion compensation other techniques most common modern standards are mpeg-2 used for dvd blu-ray satellite television mpeg-4 used for avchd mobile phones 3gp internet stereoscopic stereoscopic video can be created using several different methods two channels right channel for right eye left channel for left eye both channels may be viewed simultaneously by using light-polarizing filters degrees off-axis from each other on two video projectors these separately polarized channels are viewed wearing eyeglasses with matching polarization filters one channel with two overlaid color-coded layers this left right layer technique occasionally used for network broadcast recent anaglyph releases movies on dvd simple red/cyan plastic glasses provide means view images discretely form stereoscopic view content one channel with alternating left right frames for corresponding eye using lcd shutter glasses that read frame sync from vga display data channel alternately block image each eye so appropriate eye sees correct frame this method most common computer virtual reality
