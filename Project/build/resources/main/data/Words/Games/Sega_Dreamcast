year marked sega's third consecutive annual loss although sega's overall sales for term increased 274% dreamcast sales north america europe greatly exceeded company's expectations this increase sales coincided with decrease profitability due investments required launch dreamcast western markets poor software sales japan at same time increasingly poor market conditions reduced profitability sega's japanese arcade business prompting company close locations knowing that they have fish where fish are biting sega america president peter moore who assumed his position after stolar had been fired sega japan's developers focused on us market prepare for upcoming launch ps2 that end sega america launched its own internet service provider segacom led by ceo brad huang on september segacom

bankrupt they decided they wanted live fight another day —peter moore on dreamcast's discontinuation moore stated that dreamcast would need sell million units us by end order remain viable platform but sega ultimately fell short this goal with some million units sold moreover sega's attempts spur increased dreamcast sales through lower prices cash rebates caused escalating financial losses

billion march sega posted consolidated net loss ¥517 billion $4175 million while ps2's october us launch was marred by shortages—with only planned million units shipped due manufacturing glitch—this did not benefit dreamcast much expected many disappointed consumers continued wait for ps2—while psone remodeled version original playstation was best-selling console us at start holiday season according moore playstation effect that we were relying upon did not work for us people will hang on for long possible what effectively happened playstation lack availability froze marketplace eventually sony nintendo held percent us video game market respectively while sega held only percent according bellfield dreamcast software sold at 8-to-1 ratio with hardware but this ratio on small
