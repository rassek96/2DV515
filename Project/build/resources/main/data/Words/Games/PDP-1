important creation hacker culture at mit bbn elsewhere pdp-1 was also original hardware for playing history's first game on minicomputer steve russell 's spacewar contents description history peripherals o graphics display computer music current status see also notes external links description pdp-1 used 18-bit word size had words standard main memory equivalent eight-bit bytes though system actually used six-bit bytes upgradable 7004655360000000000♠65536 words magnetic core memory's cycle time was microseconds corresponding roughly clock speed kilohertz consequently most arithmetic instructions took microseconds operations per second because they used two memory cycles one for instruction one for operand data fetch signed numbers were represented ones' complement pdp-1 had computing power roughly equivalent pocket organizer little less memory system building block seen end-on system building blocks hex-inverter card pdp-1 system building block circa with us quarter - note that one transistor yellow has been replaced pdp-1 used transistors diodes was built mostly dec 1000-series system building blocks using micro-alloy micro-alloy diffused transistors with rated switching speed mhz system building blocks were packaged into several 19-inch racks racks were themselves packaged into single large mainframe case with hexagonal control panel containing switches lights mounted lie at table-top height at one end mainframe above control panel was system's standard input/output solution punched tape reader writer history design pdp-1 was based on pioneering tx-0 computer designed built at mit lincoln laboratory benjamin gurley was lead engineer on project after building prototype models december dec delivered first pdp-1 bolt beranek newman bbn november was formally accepted next april dec donated engineering prototype pdp-1 mit where was placed room next its ancestor tx-0 computer which was by then on indefinite loan from lincoln laboratory this setting pdp-1 quickly replaced tx-0 favorite machine among budding hacker culture served platform for wide variety firsts computing world perhaps best known among these one first computerized video games spacewar but among list are first text editor word processor interactive debugger first credible computer chess program some earliest computerized music pdp-1 sold basic form for us$120000 equivalent $950000 bbn's system was quickly followed by orders from lawrence livermore atomic energy canada aecl eventually pdp-1s were delivered until production ended all these machines were still being actively used several were eventually saved mit's example was donated computer museum boston from there ended up at computer history museum chm late version spacewar on paper tape was still tucked into case pdp-1 was found barn wichita kansas apparently formerly owned by one many aviation companies area rescued for digital historical collection also eventually ending up at chm aecl's computer was sent science north but was later scrapped launch pdp-1 marked radical shift philosophy computer design was first commercial computer that focused on interaction with user rather than just efficient use computer cycles peripherals pdp-1 type point-mode crt display console typewriter with processor frame background pdp-1 used punched paper tape its primary storage medium unlike punched card decks which could be sorted re-ordered paper tape was difficult physically edit this inspired creation text-editing programs such expensive typewriter teco because was equipped with online offline printers that were based on ibm electric typewriter mechanisms was capable what 1980s terminology would be called letter-quality printing therefore inspired tj-2 arguably first word processor console typewriter was product company named soroban engineering was ibm model b electric typewriter mechanism modified by addition switches detect keypresses solenoids activate typebars used traditional typebar mechanism not golfball ibm selectric typewriter mechanism which was not introduced until next year lettercase was selected by raising lowering massive type basket soroban was equipped with two-color inked ribbon red black interface allowed color selection programs commonly used color-coding distinguish user input from machine responses soroban mechanism was unreliable prone jamming particularly when shifting case changing ribbon color was widely disliked offline devices were typically friden flexowriters that had been specially built operate with fio-dec character coding used by pdp-1 like console typewriter these were built around typing mechanism that was mechanically same ibm electric typewriter however flexowriters were highly reliable often used for long unattended printing sessions flexowriters had electromechanical paper tape punches readers which operated synchronously with typewriter mechanism typing was performed about ten characters per second typical pdp-1 operating procedure was output text punched paper tape using pdp-1's high speed 60-character-per-second teletype model brpe punch then hand carry tape flexowriter for offline printing later years dectape drives were added some pdp-1 systems more convenient method backing up programs data enable early time-sharing this latter application usually required secondary storage medium for swapping programs data out core memory without requiring manual intervention for this purpose dectapes were far superior paper tapes terms reliability durability speed early hard disks were expensive notoriously unreliable if available working they were used primarily for speed swapping not for permanent file storage graphics display type precision crt display was point-mode device capable addressing by addressable locations at rate points per second special display one point on crt instruction was used build up images which had be refreshed many times per second active display area was inches square light pen could be used with type pick points on display optional character generator hardware for line curve generation were available computer music mit hackers also used pdp-1 for playing music four-part harmony using some special hardware — four flip-flops directly controlled by processor audio signal was filtered with simple rc filters music was prepared via peter samson's harmony compiler sophisticated text-based program with some features specifically oriented toward efficient coding baroque music several hours music were prepared for including bach fugues all mozart's eine kleine nachtmusik ode joy movement concluding beethoven's symphony no christmas carols numerous popular songs current status pdp-1 control panel only three pdp-1 computers are still known exist all three are collection computer history museum chm one prototype formerly used at mit other two are production pdp-1c machines one latter serial number last pdp-1 made has been restored
