21st century crt picture tube display technology was almost entirely supplanted worldwide by flat panel displays by early 2010s lcd tvs which increasingly used led-backlit lcds accounted for overwhelming majority television sets being manufactured display main article display device television sets may employ one several available display technologies mid-2010s lcds overwhelmingly predominate new merchandise but oled displays are claiming increasing market share they become more affordable dlp technology continues offer some advantages projection systems production plasma crt

deflection commonly used oscilloscopes type diagnostic instrument dlp main article digital light processing christie mirage dlp projector digital light processing dlp type projector technology that uses digital micromirror device some dlps have tv tuner which makes them type tv display was originally developed by dr larry hornbeck texas instruments while dlp imaging device was invented by texas instruments first dlp based projector was introduced by digital projection ltd digital projection texas instruments were both awarded emmy awards for dlp projector technology dlp used variety display applications from traditional static displays interactive displays also non-traditional embedded applications including medical security industrial uses dlp technology used dlp front projectors standalone projection units for classrooms business primarily dlp rear projection television sets digital signs also used about 85% digital cinema projection additive manufacturing power source some printers cure resins into solid objects plasma main article plasma display diagonal plasma display panel by panasonic plasma display panel pdp type flat panel display common large tv displays inches cm larger they are called plasma displays because technology utilizes small cells containing electrically charged ionized gases what are essence chambers more commonly known fluorescent lamps lcd main article liquid crystal display generic lcd tv with speakers on either side screen liquid-crystal-display televisions lcd tv are television sets that use liquid-crystal displays produce images lcd televisions are much thinner lighter than cathode ray tube crts similar display size are available much larger sizes eg inch diagonal when manufacturing costs fell this combination features made lcds practical for television receivers lcd televisions surpassed sales crt-based televisions worldwide for first time their sales figures relative other technologies accelerated lcd tvs quickly displaced only major competitors large-screen market plasma display panel rear-projection television mid-2010s lcds became by far most widely produced sold television display type lcds also have disadvantages other technologies address these weaknesses including oleds fed sed but none these have entered widespread production oled main article organic light-emitting diode oled tv oled organic light-emitting diode light-emitting diode led which emissive electroluminescent layer film organic compound which emits light response electric current this layer organic semiconductor situated between two electrodes generally at least one these electrodes transparent oleds are used create digital displays devices such television screens also used for computer monitors portable systems such mobile phones handheld games consoles pdas there are two main families oled those based on small molecules those employing polymers adding mobile ions oled creates light-emitting electrochemical cell lec which has slightly different mode operation oled displays can use either passive-matrix pmoled active-matrix addressing schemes active-matrix oleds amoled require thin-film transistor backplane switch each individual pixel on off but allow for higher resolution larger display sizes oled display works without backlight thus can display deep black levels can be thinner lighter than liquid crystal display lcd low ambient light conditions such dark room oled screen can achieve higher contrast ratio than lcd whether lcd uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps led backlight outdoor television outdoor television set designed for outdoor use usually found outdoor sections bars sports fields other community facilities most outdoor televisions use high-definition television technology their body more robust screens are designed remain clearly visible even sunny outdoor lighting screens also have anti-reflective coatings prevent glare they are weather-resistant often also have anti-theft brackets
