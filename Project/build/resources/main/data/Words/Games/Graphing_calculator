obsolete year casio cassiopeia a-10 a-11 flip top stylus-operated pdas which ran maple v symbolic engine hp-28 ranges were primarily meant for professional science/engineering markets hp-38/39/40 were sold high school/college educational market while hp-49 series cater both educational professional customers all levels hp series graphing calculators best known for its reverse polish notation rpn / reverse polish lisp rpl interface although hp-49g introduced standard expression entry interface well texas instruments has produced graphing calculators since oldest which was ti-81 some newer calculators are similar with addition more memory faster processors usb connection such ti-82 ti-83 series ti-84 series other models designed be appropriate for students 10–14 years age are ti-80 ti-73 other ti graphing calculators have been designed be appropriate for calculus namely ti-85 ti-86 ti-89 series ti-92 series ti-92 ti-92 plus voyage ti offers cas on ti-89 ti-nspire cas ti-92 series calculators ti calculators are targeted specifically educational market but are also widely available general public features computer algebra systems some graphing calculators have computer algebra system cas which means that they are capable producing symbolic results these calculators can manipulate algebraic expressions performing operations such factor expand simplify addition they can give answers exact form without numerical approximations calculators that have computer algebra system are called symbolic cas calculators examples symbolic calculators include hp 50g hp prime ti-89 ti-nspire cas casio classpad laboratory usage many graphing calculators can be attached devices like electronic thermometers ph gauges weather instruments decibel light meters accelerometers other sensors therefore function data loggers well wifi other communication modules for monitoring polling interaction with teacher student laboratory exercises with data from such devices enhances learning math especially statistics mechanics games since graphing calculators are usually readily user-programmable such calculators are also widely used for gaming purposes with sizable body user-created game software on most popular platforms easy get games for your graphing calculator even though handheld gaming devices fall similar price range graphing calculators offer superior math programming capability for math based games however for developers advanced users like researchers analysts gamers 3rd party software development involving firmware mods whether for powerful gaming exploiting capabilities beyond published data sheet programming language contentious issue with manufacturers education authorities might incite unfair calculator use during standardized high school college tests where these devices are targeted nowadays graduate masters students researchers have turned advanced computer aided math software for learning well experimenting color some graphing calculators are capable color output feature animated interactive drawing math plots other figures such animated algebra theorems preparation documents which can include these plots drawings etc some calculator manufacturers also offer computer software for emulating working with handheld graphing calculators graphing calculators education ti-89 titanium capable doing symbolic manipulation computer algebra system cas north america – high school mathematics teachers allow even encourage their students use graphing calculators class some cases especially calculus courses they are required some them are disallowed certain classes such chemistry physics due their capacity contain full periodic tables college board united states – permits use most graphing cas calculators that do not have qwerty-style keyboard for parts its ap sat exams but act exam ib schools do not permit use calculators with computer algebra systems united kingdom – graphics calculator allowed for a-level maths courses excluding c1 module where no calculator any kind permitted however they are not required exams are designed be broadly 'calculator neutral' similarly at gcse all current courses include one paper where no calculator any kind can be used but students are permitted use graphical calculators for other papers use graphical calculators at gcse not widespread with cost being likely factor use cas not allowed for either a-level gcse scottish sqa allows use graphic calculators maths exams excluding paper which exclusively non-calculator however these should either be checked before exams by invigilators handed out by exam centre certain functions / information not allowed be stored on calculator exam sqa exams do not favour graphic calculator since working must be shown for full marks do not give significant advantage over candidates who do not use them finland slovenia – certain other countries forbidden use calculators with symbolic calculation cas graphics features matriculation exam this will change case finland however symbolic calculators will be allowed from spring onwards norway – calculators with wireless communication capabilities such ir links have been banned at some technical universities australia – policies vary from state state o victoria – vce specifies approved calculators applicable for its mathematics exams for further mathematics approved graphics calculator for example ti-83/84 casio hp-39g cas for example ti-89 classpad hp-40g can be used mathematical methods mathematical methods cas have common technology free examination consisting short answer some extended answer questions they also each have technology assumed access examination consisting extended response multiple choice questions graphics calculator assumed technology for mathematical methods cas for mathematical methods cas these two exams have substantial material common but also some distinctive questions specialist mathematics has technology free examination technology assumed access examination where either approved graphics calculator cas may be used calculator memories are not required be cleared subjects like physics chemistry students are only allowed standard scientific calculator o western australia – all tertiary entrance examinations mathematics involve calculator section which assume student has graphics calculator cas enabled calculators are also permitted subjects such physics chemistry accounting only non programmable calculators are permitted o new south wales – graphics calculators are allowed for general mathematics higher school certificate exam but disallowed higher level mathematics courses china - calculators general are banned primary secondary education india - calculators are banned primary secondary education university degree diploma courses have their own rules on use permitted models calculators exams new zealand – calculators identified having high-level algebraic manipulation capability are prohibited ncea examinations unless specifically allowed by standard subject prescription this includes calculators such ti-89 series turkey – any type calculator whatsoever prohibited all primary high schools except ib american schools singapore – graphing calculators are used junior colleges required mathematics paper gce 'a' levels most schools use ti-84 plus ti-84 plus silver edition netherlands – high school students are obliged use graphing calculators during tests exams their final three years most students use ti-83 plus ti-84 plus but other graphing calculators are allowed including casio cfx-9860g hp-39g graphing calculators are almost always allowed be used during tests instead normal calculators which sometimes results cheat sheets being made on forehand exchanged before test starts using link cables israel – graphing calculators are forbidden use bagrut equvalent american sat math exam addition programmable calculators university degree diploma courses have their own rules on use permitted models calculators exams programming graphing calculators are sometimes used for gaming most graphing calculators well some non-graphing scientific programmer's calculators can be programmed automate complex frequently used series calculations those inaccessible from keyboard actual programming can often be done on computer then later uploaded calculators most common tools for this include pc link cable software for given calculator configurable text editors hex editors specialized programming tools such below-mentioned implementation various languages on computer side earlier calculators stored programs on magnetic cards like increased memory capacity has made storage on calculator most common implementation some newer machines can also use memory cards many graphing scientific calculators will tokenize program text replacing textual programming elements with short numerical tokens many graphical calculators work much like computers use versions 7-bit 8-bit 9-bit ascii-derived character sets even utf-8 unicode many them have tool similar character map on windows they also have basic like functions such chr$ chr char asc so on which sometimes may be more pascal c like one example may be use ord pascal instead asc many basic variants return code character ie position character collating sequence machine cable and/or irda transceiver connecting calculator computer make process easier expands other possibilities such on-board spreadsheet database graphics word processing programs second option being able code programs on board calculator itself this option facilitated by inclusion full-screen text editors other programming tools default feature set calculator optional items some calculators have qwerty keyboards others can be attached external keyboard which can be close size regular 102-key computer keyboard programming major use for software cables used connect calculators computers most common programming languages used for calculators are similar keystroke-macro languages variants basic latter can have large feature set—approaching that basic found computers—including character string manipulation advanced conditional branching statements sound graphics more including course huge spectrum mathematical string bit-manipulation number base i/o graphics functions built into machine languages for programming calculators fall into all main groups ie machine code low-level mid-level high-level languages for systems application programming scripting macro glue languages procedural functional imperative & object-oriented programming can be achieved some cases most calculators capable being connected computer can be programmed assembly language machine code although on some calculators this only possible through using exploits most common assembly machine languages are for tms9900 sh-3 zilog z80 various motorola chips eg modified which serve main processors machines although many not all are modified some extent from their use elsewhere some manufacturers do not document even mildly discourage assembly language programming their machines because they must be programmed this way by putting together program on pc then forcing into calculator by various improvised methods other on-board programming languages include purpose-made languages variants eiffel forth lisp command script facilities which are similar function batch/shell programming other glue languages on computers but generally not full featured ports other languages like bbc basic development on-board interpreters for fortran rexx awk perl unix shells eg bash zsh other shells dos/windows 9x os/2 windows nt family shells well related 4dos 4nt 4os2 well dcl cobol c python tcl pascal delphi algol other languages are at various levels development some calculators especially those with other pda-like functions have actual operating systems including ti proprietary os for its more recent machines dos windows ce rarely windows nt embedded et seq linux experiments with ti-89 ti-92 ti-92 plus voyage machines show possibility installing some variants other systems such chopped-down variant cp/m-68k operating system which has been used for portable devices past tools which allow for programming calculators c/c++ possibly fortran assembly language are used on computer side such hpgcc tigcc others flash memory another means conveyance information from calculator on-board basic variants ti graphing calculators languages available on hp-48 type calculators can be used for rapid prototyping by developers professors students often when computer not close at hand most graphing calculators have on-board spreadsheets which usually integrate with microsoft excel on computer side at this time spreadsheets with macro other automation facilities on calculator side are not on market some cases list matrix data grid facilities can be combined with native programming language calculator have
