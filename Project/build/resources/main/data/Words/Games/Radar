aircraft rotates steadily sweeping airspace with narrow beam radar object-detection system that uses radio waves determine range angle velocity objects can be used detect aircraft ships spacecraft guided missiles motor vehicles weather formations terrain radar system consists transmitter producing electromagnetic waves radio microwaves domain transmitting antenna receiving antenna often same antenna used for transmitting receiving receiver processor determine properties objects radio waves pulsed continous from transmitter reflect off object return receiver giving information about object's location speed radar was developed secretly for military use by several nations period before during world war ii term radar was coined by united states navy acronym for radio detection ranging term radar has since entered english other languages common noun losing all capitalization modern uses radar are highly diverse including air terrestrial traffic control radar astronomy

technical reading external links history main article history radar early german physicist heinrich hertz showed that radio waves could be reflected from solid objects alexander popov physics instructor at imperial russian navy school kronstadt developed apparatus using coherer tube for detecting distant lightning strikes next year he added spark-gap transmitter while testing this equipment for communicating between two ships baltic sea he took note interference beat caused by passage third vessel his report popov wrote that this phenomenon might be used for detecting objects but he did nothing more with this observation german inventor christian hülsmeyer was first use radio waves detect presence distant metallic objects he demonstrated feasibility detecting ship dense fog but not its distance from transmitter he obtained patent for his detection device april later patent for related amendment for estimating distance ship he also got british patent on september for full radar system that he called telemobiloscope operated on cm wavelength pulsed radar signal was created via spark-gap his system already used classic antenna setup horn antenna with parabolic reflector was presented german military officials practical tests cologne rotterdam harbour but was rejected experimental radar antenna us naval research laboratory anacostia d c late 1930s first workable radar unit constructed by robert watson watt his team chain home tower great baddow united kingdom hoyt taylor leo c young researchers working with us navy had transmitter receiver on opposite sides potomac river discovered that ship passing through beam path caused received signal fade out taylor submitted report suggesting that this might be used detect presence ships low visibility but navy did not immediately continue work eight years later lawrence hyland at naval research laboratory observed similar fading effects from passing aircraft this led patent application well proposal for serious work at nrl taylor young were then at this laboratory on radio-echo signals from moving targets during 1920s uk research establishment made many advances using radio techniques including probing ionosphere detection lightning at long distances robert watson-watt became expert on use radio direction finding part his lightning experiments part ongoing experiments he asked new boy arnold frederic wilkins find receiver suitable for use with shortwave transmissions wilkins made extensive study available units before selecting receiver model from general post office its instruction manual noted that there was fading common term for interference at time when aircraft flew by before second world war researchers france germany italy japan netherlands soviet union united kingdom united states independently great secrecy developed technologies that led modern version radar australia canada new zealand south africa followed prewar great britain hungary had similar developments during war france following systematic studies on split anode magnetron research branch compagnie générale de télégraphie sans fil csf headed by maurice ponte with henri gutton sylvain berline m hugon began developing obstacle-locating radio apparatus part which was installed on liner normandie during same time soviet military engineer p k oshchepkov collaboration with leningrad electrophysical institute produced experimental apparatus rapid capable detecting aircraft within km receiver soviets produced their first mass production radars rus-1 rus-2 redut but further development was slowed by nkvd arrest oshchepkov their sending him gulag total only redut stations were produced during war first russian airborne radar gneiss-2 entered into service june on pe-2 fighters more than gneiss-2 stations were produced by end french soviet systems however had continuous-wave operation could not give full performance that was ultimately at center modern radar full radar evolved pulsed system first such elementary apparatus was demonstrated december by american robert m page working at naval research laboratory following year united states army successfully tested primitive surface-to-surface radar aim coastal battery searchlights at night this was followed by pulsed system demonstrated may by rudolf kühnhold firm gema germany then one june by air ministry team led by robert watson-watt great britain development radar greatly expanded on september when watson-watt became superintendent new establishment under british air ministry bawdsey research station located bawdsey manor near felixstowe suffolk work there resulted design installation aircraft detection tracking stations called chain home along east south coasts england time for outbreak world war ii this system provided vital advance information that helped royal air force win battle britain watt was asked pass judgement on recent reports german radio-based death ray turned request over wilkins wilkins returned set calculations demonstrating system was basically impossible when watt then asked what might they do wilkins recalled earlier report about aircraft causing radio interference this led daventry experiment february using powerful bbc shortwave transmitter source their gpo receiver set up field while bomber flew around site when returns were clearly seen funds were immediately provided for development operational system watt's team patented device gb593017 given all required funding development support team had working radar systems began deployment by first five chain home ch systems were operational by stretched across entire uk including northern ireland even by standards era ch was crude instead broadcasting receiving from aimed antenna ch broadcast signal floodlighting entire area front then used one watt's own radio direction finders determine direction returned echoes this meant that ch transmitters had be much more powerful have better antennas than competing systems but allowed its rapid introduction using existing technologies april popular science showed example radar unit using watson-watt patent article on air defence also late popular mechanics had article which us scientist speculated about british early warning system on english east coast came close what was how worked alfred lee loomis organized radiation laboratory at cambridge massachusetts which developed technology years 1941-45 later page greatly improved radar with monopulse technique that was used for many years most radar applications war precipitated research find better resolution more portability more features for radar including complementary navigation systems like oboe used by raf's pathfinder applications commercial marine radar antenna rotating antenna radiates vertical fan-shaped beam information provided by radar includes bearing range therefore position object from radar scanner thus used many different fields where need for such positioning crucial first use radar was for military purposes locate air ground sea targets this evolved civilian field into applications for aircraft ships roads aviation aircraft are equipped with radar devices that warn aircraft other obstacles approaching their path display weather information give accurate altitude readings first commercial device fitted aircraft was bell lab unit on some united air lines aircraft such aircraft can land fog at airports equipped with radar-assisted ground-controlled approach systems which plane's flight observed on radar screens while operators radio landing directions pilot marine radars are used measure bearing distance ships prevent collision with other ships navigate fix their position at sea when within range shore other fixed

become primary tool for short-term weather forecasting watching for severe weather such thunderstorms tornadoes winter storms precipitation types etc geologists use specialized ground-penetrating radars map composition earth's crust police forces use radar guns monitor vehicle speeds on roads smaller radar systems are used detect human movement examples are breathing pattern detection for sleep monitoring hand finger gesture detection for computer interaction principles radar signal further information radar signal characteristics radar system has transmitter that emits radio waves called radar signals predetermined directions when these come into contact with object they are usually reflected scattered many directions radar signals are reflected especially well by materials considerable electrical conductivity—especially by most metals by seawater by wet ground some these make use radar altimeters possible radar signals that are reflected back towards transmitter are desirable ones that make radar work if object moving either toward away from transmitter there slight equivalent change frequency radio waves caused by doppler effect radar receivers are usually but not always same location transmitter although reflected radar signals captured by receiving antenna are usually very weak they can be strengthened by electronic amplifiers more sophisticated methods signal processing are also used order recover useful radar signals weak absorption radio waves by medium through which passes what enables radar sets detect objects at relatively long ranges—ranges at which other electromagnetic wavelengths such visible light infrared light ultraviolet light are too strongly attenuated such weather phenomena fog clouds rain falling snow sleet that block visible light are usually transparent radio waves certain radio frequencies that are absorbed scattered by water vapour raindrops atmospheric gases especially oxygen are avoided designing radars except when their detection intended illumination radar relies on its own transmissions rather than light from sun moon from electromagnetic waves emitted by objects themselves such infrared wavelengths heat this process directing artificial radio waves towards objects called illumination although radio waves are invisible human eye optical cameras reflection main article reflection physics brightness can indicate reflectivity this weather radar image hurricane abby radar's frequency pulse form polarization signal processing antenna determine what can observe if electromagnetic waves travelling through one material meet another material having different dielectric constant diamagnetic constant from first waves will reflect scatter from boundary between materials this means that solid object air vacuum significant change atomic density between object what surrounding will usually scatter radar radio waves from its surface this particularly true for electrically conductive materials such metal carbon fibre making radar well-suited detection aircraft ships radar absorbing material containing resistive sometimes magnetic substances used on military vehicles reduce radar reflection this radio equivalent painting something dark colour so that cannot be seen by eye at night radar waves scatter variety ways depending on size wavelength radio wave shape target if wavelength much shorter than target's size wave will bounce off way similar way light reflected by mirror if wavelength much longer than size target target may not be visible because poor reflection low-frequency radar technology dependent on resonances for detection but not identification targets this described by rayleigh scattering effect that creates earth's blue sky red sunsets when two length scales are comparable there may be resonances early radars used very long wavelengths that were larger than targets thus received vague signal where some modern systems use shorter wavelengths few centimetres less that can image objects small loaf bread short radio waves reflect from curves corners way similar glint from rounded piece glass most reflective targets for short wavelengths have 90° angles between reflective surfaces corner reflector consists three flat surfaces meeting like inside corner box structure will reflect waves entering its opening directly back source they are commonly used radar reflectors make otherwise difficult-to-detect objects easier detect corner reflectors on boats for example make them more detectable avoid collision during rescue for similar reasons objects intended avoid detection will not have inside corners surfaces edges perpendicular likely detection directions which leads odd looking stealth aircraft these precautions do not completely eliminate reflection because diffraction especially at longer wavelengths half wavelength long wires strips conducting material such chaff are very reflective but do not direct scattered energy back toward source extent which object reflects scatters radio waves called its radar cross section radar equation power pr returning receiving antenna given by equation p r = p t g t r σ f π r t r r {\displaystyle p{r}={{p{t}g{t}a{r}\sigma f^{4}} \over {{4\pi }^{2}r{t}^{2}r{r}^{2}}}} where pt = transmitter power gt = gain transmitting antenna ar = effective aperture area receiving antenna this can also be expressed g r λ π {\displaystyle {g{r}\lambda ^{2}} \over {4\pi }} where λ {\displaystyle \lambda } = transmitted wavelength gr = gain receiving antenna σ = radar cross section scattering coefficient target f = pattern propagation factor rt = distance from transmitter target rr = distance from target receiver common case where transmitter receiver are at same location rt = rr term rt² rr² can be replaced by r4 where r range this yields p r = p t g t r σ f π r {\displaystyle p{r}={{p{t}g{t}a{r}\sigma f^{4}} \over {{4\pi }^{2}r^{4}}}} this shows that received power declines fourth power range which means that received power from distant targets relatively very small additional filtering pulse integration modifies radar equation slightly for pulse-doppler radar performance which can be used increase detection range reduce transmit power equation above with f = simplification for transmission vacuum without interference propagation factor accounts for effects multipath shadowing depends on details environment real-world situation pathloss effects should also be considered doppler effect main articles doppler radar pulse-doppler radar frequency shift caused by motion that changes number wavelengths between reflector radar that can degrade enhance radar performance depending upon how that affects detection process example moving target indication can interact with doppler produce signal cancellation at certain radial velocities which degrades performance sea-based radar systems semi-active radar homing active radar homing weather radar military aircraft radar astronomy rely on doppler effect enhance performance this produces information about target velocity during detection process this also allows small objects be detected environment containing much larger nearby slow moving objects doppler shift depends upon whether radar configuration active passive active radar transmits signal that reflected back receiver passive radar depends upon object sending signal receiver doppler frequency shift for active radar follows where f d {\displaystyle f{d}} doppler frequency f t {\displaystyle f{t}} transmit frequency v r {\displaystyle v{r}} radial velocity c {\displaystyle c} speed light f d = × f t × v r c {\displaystyle f{d}=2\times f{t}\times \left{\frac {v{r}}{c}}\right} passive radar applicable electronic countermeasures radio astronomy follows f d = f t × v r c {\displaystyle f{d}=f{t}\times \left{\frac {v{r}}{c}}\right} only radial component velocity relevant when reflector moving at right angle radar beam has no relative velocity vehicles weather moving parallel radar beam produce maximum doppler frequency shift when transmit frequency f t {\displaystyle f{t}} pulsed using pulse repeat frequency f r {\displaystyle f{r}} resulting frequency spectrum will contain harmonic frequencies above below f t {\displaystyle f{t}} with distance f r {\displaystyle f{r}} result doppler measurement only non-ambiguous if doppler frequency shift less than half f r {\displaystyle f{r}} called nyquist frequency since returned frequency otherwise cannot be distinguished from shifting harmonic frequency above below thus requiring | f d | m

meteorological observation imaging radar modulators modulators act provide waveform rf-pulse there are two different radar modulator designs high voltage switch for non-coherent keyed power-oscillators these modulators consist high voltage pulse generator formed from high voltage supply pulse forming network high voltage switch such thyratron they generate short pulses power feed eg magnetron special type vacuum tube that converts dc usually pulsed into microwaves this technology known pulsed power this way transmitted pulse rf radiation kept defined usually very short duration hybrid mixers fed by waveform generator exciter for complex but coherent waveform this waveform can be generated by low power/low-voltage input signals this case radar transmitter must be power-amplifier eg klystron tube solid state transmitter this way transmitted pulse intrapulse-modulated radar receiver must use pulse compression techniques radar coolant main article coolant coherent microwave amplifiers operating above watts microwave output like travelling wave tubes klystrons require liquid coolant electron beam must contain times more power than microwave output which can produce enough heat generate plasma this plasma flows from collector toward cathode same magnetic focusing that guides electron beam forces plasma into path electron beam but flowing opposite
