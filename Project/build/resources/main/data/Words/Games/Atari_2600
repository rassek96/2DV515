under name syzygy bushnell dabney changed name their company atari atari inc had purchased engineering think tank called cyan engineering research next-generation video game systems had been working on prototype known stella named after one engineers' bicycles for some time unlike prior generations machines that use custom logic play small number games its core complete cpu famous mos technology cost-reduced version known was combined with ram-and-i/o chip mos technology display sound chip known television interface adaptor tia first two versions machine contain fourth chip standard cmos logic buffer ic making stella cost-effective some later versions console eliminated buffer chip programs for small computers time were generally stored on cassette tapes floppy disks paper tape by early 1970s hewlett-packard manufactured desktop computers costing thousands dollars such hp which packaged read only memory rom into removable cartridges add special programming features these were being considered for use games at first design was not going be cartridge-based but after seeing fake cartridge system on another machine they realized they could place games on cartridges essentially for price connector packaging fairchild semiconductor released their own cpu-based system video entertainment system stella was still not ready for production but was clear that needed be before there were number me too products filling up market which had happened after they released pong atari inc didn't have cash flow complete system quickly given that sales their pong systems were cooling nolan bushnell eventually turned warner communications sold company them for us$28 million on promise that stella would be produced soon possible key eventual success machine was hiring jay miner chip designer who managed squeeze entire wire wrap equipment making up tia into single chip once that was completed debugged system was ready for shipping launch success this section needs additional

second model light sixer which has lighter plastic molding shielding more angular shape than launch model heavy sixer later models only used four front switches unit was originally priced at us$199 $778 adjusted for inflation shipped with two joysticks combat cartridge eight additional games were available at launch sold separately move compete directly with channel f atari inc named machine video computer system vcs for short channel f was at that point known ves for video entertainment system vcs was also rebadged sears video arcade sold through sears roebuck company stores another breakthrough for gaming systems was atari's invention computer-controlled opponent rather than usual two-player asymmetric challenges past when fairchild learned atari inc's naming they quickly changed name their system become channel f however both systems were now midst vicious round price-cutting pong clones that had been made obsolete by these newer more powerful machines were sold off discounters for ever-lower prices soon many clone companies were out business both fairchild atari inc were selling public that was completely burnt out on pong atari inc sold video computer systems for first year production video computer system was manufactured sunnyvale california consoles manufactured there had thick plastic molding around sides bottom these added weight console because all six switches were on front these consoles were nicknamed heavy sixers after this first year production moved hong kong consoles manufactured there had thinner plastic molding only units from production run were sold requiring further financial support from warner cover losses this led directly disagreements that caused atari inc founder nolan bushnell leave company despite bushnell's retirement warren robinett's invention first graphical adventure game adventure was developed same year changed fundamentals gaming unlocked game with virtual space bigger than screen once public realized was possible play video games other than pong programmers learned how push its hardware's capabilities vcs gained popularity by this point fairchild had given up thinking video games were passing fad thereby handing entire quickly growing market atari inc by vcs was best-selling christmas gift console due its exclusive content million units were sold that year atari inc then licensed smash arcade hit space invaders by taito which greatly increased unit's popularity when was released january doubling sales over million units vcs its cartridges were main factor behind atari inc grossing more than $2 billion sales then doubled again for next two years by console had sold million units while its best-selling game pac-man sold million copies console also sold units west germany by by console cost atari about $40 make was sold for average $125 company spent $450 $6 manufacture each cartridge $1 $2 for advertising sold for $1895 wholesale all black darth vader 4-switch model from 1982- vcs was given minor revision which left right difficulty switches were moved back console leaving four switches on front other than this these four-switch consoles looked nearly identical earlier six-switch models another version four-switch console was released without woodgrain they were nicknamed darth vader consoles due their all-black appearance these were also first consoles be officially called atari atari was released same year during this period atari inc expanded family with two other compatible consoles despite faux-wood panels what would now appear be primitive graphics game console became widely popular for time later however they designed atari wireless version console that was never released because design flaw company also built sleeker version machine dubbed atari sell directly japanese market early but suffered from competition with newly released nintendo famicom survey mentioned by jeff rovin reported that more stores reported breakdowns atari system than any other that atari repair centers seemed have most trouble with consoles manufactured one case stated that system was repaired five times before static electricity from carpet was discovered having caused problem controllers were also source breakage because way they could be gripped by player holding with their fist allowing players get carried away over control which was less likely with other systems released at time such magnavox odyssey² which has controllers that are nearly half its size sears tele-games 2600s sears got rebranded video arcade for its tele-games line atari inc also continued their oem relationship with sears under latter's tele-games brand label which started with original pong sears released several versions sears video arcade series from these include rev heavy sixer model rev b switch model us version atari branded sears video arcade ii sears also released their own versions atari inc's games under tele-games brand — often with different titles — which included tele-games branded variations text picture labels three games were also produced by atari inc for sears exclusive releases under tele-games brand steeplechase stellar track submarine commander sears's tele-games brand was unrelated company telegames which also produced cartridges for atari — mostly re-issues m network games decline remodel during 1970s atari inc continued grow until had one largest r&d divisions silicon valley however spent much its r&d budget on projects that seemed out place at video game even home computer company many these projects never saw light day meanwhile several attempts bring out newer consoles failed for one reason another although atari inc's home computer system atari 8-bit family sold reasonably well warner was pleased seemed have no end sales atari inc was responsible for over half company's income programmers many atari inc's biggest hits grew disgruntled with company for not crediting game developers many left company formed their own independent software companies most prominent longest-lasting these third-party developers was activision founded whose titles quickly became more popular than those atari inc itself atari inc attempted block third-party development for court but failed soon other publishers such imagic coleco entered market atari inc suffered from image problem when company named mystique produced number pornographic games for most notorious these custer's revenge was protested by women's native american groups because depicted general george armstrong custer raping bound native american woman atari inc sued mystique court over release game atari inc continued acquire licenses for most prominent which included pac-man et public disappointment with these two titles market saturation poor third-party titles are cited major contributors video game crash suddenly atari inc's growth meant was losing massive amounts money during crash at one point about $10000 day this part led atari video game burial 1000s unsold atari games desert new mexico warner quickly grew tired supporting atari inc started looking for buyers by mid-1984 most software development for had stopped except by atari activision with third-party developers emphasizing colecovision games although not formally discontinued was de-emphasized for two years after warner's sale atari inc's consumer division commodore business machines founder jack tramiel who wanted concentrate on home computers he ended all development console games including garfield game atari port super pac-man due large library low price point 2600jr continued sell into late 1980s was not discontinued until ended up outdoing all other hardware that atari released attempt replicate its success atari design japanese atari was later used america by sears for second video arcade model atari japanese version atari released october was first release designed specifically for japanese market despite companies like epoch distributing japan previously fact atari's name was inspired by japanese game 'go' never captured large market japan was released short time after nintendo's family computer which became dominant console japanese video game market time codenamed cindy designed by atari engineer joe tilly atari had four controller ports instead standard two on atari 2600's controllers are all-in one

specially branded games were released for their boxes are japanese have silver/red color scheme similar packaging atari's branded games time rom cartridges themselves had identical labels their branded counterparts sears liked design atari so much they opted sell version under their tele-games label was released us sears video arcade ii was packaged with controllers space invaders atari 2800's case style was used basis for atari 7800's case style by barney huang atari jr atari its cost-reduced version also known jr new version was released newly redesigned version unofficially referred jr features smaller cost-reduced form factor with modernized atari 7800-like appearance redesigned was advertised budget gaming system under us$50 that has ability run large collection classic games atari continued sell north america europe until asia until early 1990s its final atari-licensed release klax atari was inducted into toy hall fame with million units sold its lifetime youngest toy be inducted brazil console became extremely popular mid-1980s atari was officially retired by atari corp on january making at time longest-lived home video game console years months video game history was later surpassed by sega master system console that never formally ended production brazil atari was also at time best-selling american-made console selling million units this record would later be broken by xbox which sold million units system was promoted on united kingdom tv ad run-up christmas which claimed fun back advertising campaign used its price under £50 selling point advert was re-dubbed version early original campaign united states also jr was originally be packaged with pro-line joystick same one used on atari but when was released instead included original cx-40 joystick later european versions jr included joypad which was also featured with european design hardware main article atari hardware this section's tone style may not reflect encyclopedic tone used on wikipedia see wikipedia's guide writing better articles for suggestions august learn how when remove this template message standard joystick cpu was mos technology stripped-down version running at mhz though their internal silicon wafer was identical was cheaper than because its package included fewer memory-address pins—13 instead smaller packaging was still important factor overall system cost since memory was very expensive at time 6507's small kb maximum external memory space was not going be used up anyway designers atari selected inexpensive cartridge interface that had one fewer address than allowed by further reducing already limited addressable memory kb 2^12 = this was believed be sufficient combat was itself only kb atari established their system design order be compatible with cathode-ray tube television sets late 1970s early 1980s later games get around this limitation with bank switching maximum supported cartridge size kilobytes console has only bytes ram

produces visual artifacts problem that programmers call racing beam 2600's video hardware therefore highly flexible but also challenging program one advantage has over more powerful contemporary competitors such colecovision that has no protection against altering settings mid-line for example although each sprite nominally has only one color possible color rows differently by changing sprite's color drawn if two hardware sprites are not enough for game developer may share one sprite among several objects with ghosts pac-man draw software sprites which only little more difficult than drawing fixed playfield pitfall screenshot below section games demonstrates some these tricks player multicolor sprite one sprite multiplexed for logs scorpion swinging vine drawn by shifting position ball on each scan line despite hardware limitations many atari games have lot action on screen creating engaging experience furthermore atari was one first consoles introduce video game cartridges instead having hardwired games built into allowing for play multiple different games rather than usual one built atari originally shipped with two types controllers joystick well pair paddle controllers later new controllers were added game system including driving controller trak-ball controller finally keypad controllers additionally supports several types input devices well third-party peripherals many these peripherals are interchangeable with msx other japanese systems some cases possible use atari joysticks with commodore commodore amiga sega master system mega drive/genesis though functionality may be somewhat limited also although master system mega drive/genesis controllers work on atari only b button can be used most games another adapter starpath supercharger add-on created by starpath expand game capabilities atari supercharger's interface adds extra kb atari 2600's bytes ram allowing for larger games with higher-resolution graphics cord

were released on cartridge accompany launch machine including outlaw space war breakout during console's lifetime atari inc atari corp published many titles these games included adventure often credited starting action-adventure game genre breakout yars' revenge console's popularity attracted many third-party developers which led popular titles such activision's pitfall imagic's atlantis however two atari published titles et extra-terrestrial pac-man are frequently blamed for contributing video game crash legacy atari was wildly successful during much 1980s atari was synonym for this model mainstream media by extension for video games general atari was inducted into national toy hall fame at strong rochester new york atari was named second greatest video game console all time by ign who cited its remarkable role console behind both first video game boom video game crash called console that our entire industry built upon atari atari model number cx-2000 was prototype version atari that was intended be released cheaper alternative for children although identical specification original included built-in controllers innovative case design was originally intended be black but was later recolored blue appeal more children while atari never officially stated reason for not releasing experts have cited poor quality durability its built-in joysticks greater in-house popularity competing jr design most likely reasons atari atari started work on replacement called atari with codenames including super stella sylvia pam note attached reads super stella multipurpose system was have compatibility with atari cartridges was rumored be based on 10-bit processor although design documents shows was actually be based around 8-bit cpu was still unfinished when preliminary game programmers discovered that was difficult program project was cancelled atari went with second system x also titled pam that would later become atari atari also cloned atari into sears super arcade ii but this was never released clones reissues console its old new games are very popular with collectors because its significant impact on video game consumer electronics history also due its nostalgic value for many people along with number games that are still considered highly playable addition modern atari clones remain on market one example atari classics 10-in-1 tv game manufactured by jakks pacific which emulates console includes converted versions games into single atari-brand-lookalike joystick with composite-video outputs for connecting directly modern televisions vcrs another tv boy which includes games enlarged joypad atari flashback console released contains games with four additional programs unlockable by cheat code console implements original architecture can be modified play original cartridges by adding cartridge port also compatible with original controllers music many games for atari have detailed easily identifiable music its distinctive sound makes ideal for use modern lo-fi industrial music dallas musician visual artist paul slocum developed cartridge called synthcart for atari which allows user turn atari into two-voice synthesizer drum machine adapters have also been developed by amateurs enabling atari 2600's use with midi devices number bands such bit weapon black moth super rainbow squigs well slocum's own band tree wave use synthcart make modern
