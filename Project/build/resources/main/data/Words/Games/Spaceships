satellite was launched into elliptical low earth orbit leo by soviet union on october launch ushered new political military technological scientific developments while sputnik launch was single event marked start space age apart from its value technological first sputnik also helped identify upper atmospheric layer's density through measuring satellite's orbital changes also provided data on radio-signal distribution ionosphere pressurized nitrogen satellite's false body provided first opportunity for meteoroid detection sputnik was launched during international geophysical year from site no1/5 at 5th tyuratam range kazakh ssr now at baikonur cosmodrome satellite travelled at kilometers mi per hour taking minutes complete orbit emitted radio signals at mhz while sputnik was first spacecraft orbit earth other man-made objects had previously reached altitude km which height required by international organization fédération aéronautique internationale count spaceflight this altitude called kármán line particular 1940s there were several test launches v-2 rocket some which reached altitudes well over km past present spacecraft manned spacecraft see also list manned spacecraft human spaceflight only three nations have flown manned spacecraft ussr/russia usa china first manned spacecraft was vostok which carried soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin into space completed full earth orbit there were five other manned missions which used vostok spacecraft second manned spacecraft was named freedom performed sub-orbital spaceflight carrying american astronaut alan shepard altitude just over kilometers mi there were five other manned missions using mercury spacecraft other soviet manned spacecraft include voskhod soyuz flown unmanned zond/l1 l3 tks salyut mir

since november joint venture between russia united states canada several other countries spaceplanes main article spaceplane columbia orbiter landing some reusable vehicles have been designed only for manned spaceflight these are often called spaceplanes first example such was north american x-15 spaceplane which conducted two manned flights which reached altitude over km 1960s first reusable spacecraft x-15 was air-launched on suborbital trajectory on july first partially reusable orbital spacecraft winged non-capsule space shuttle was launched by usa on 20th anniversary yuri gagarin's flight on april during shuttle era six orbiters were built all which have flown atmosphere five which have flown space enterprise was used only for approach landing tests launching from back boeing sca gliding deadstick landings at edwards afb california first space shuttle fly into space was columbia followed by challenger discovery atlantis endeavour endeavour was built replace challenger when was lost january columbia broke up during reentry february first automatic partially reusable spacecraft was buran snowstorm launched by ussr on november although made only one flight this was unmanned this spaceplane was designed for crew strongly resembled us space shuttle although its drop-off boosters used liquid propellants its main engines were located at base what would be external tank american shuttle lack funding complicated by dissolution ussr prevented any further flights buran space shuttle was subsequently modified allow for autonomous re-entry case necessity per vision for space exploration space shuttle was retired due mainly its old age high cost program reaching over billion dollars per flight shuttle's human transport role be replaced by space x's dragon v2 boeing's cst-100 starliner no later than shuttle's heavy cargo transport role be replaced by expendable rockets such space launch system spacex's falcon heavy scaled composites' spaceshipone was

spacecraft's bus may include attitude determination control variously called adac adc acs guidance navigation control gnc gn&c communications comms command data handling cdh c&dh power eps thermal control tcs propulsion structures attached bus are typically payloads life support spacecraft intended for human spaceflight must also include life support system for crew reaction control system thrusters on front us space shuttle attitude control spacecraft needs attitude control subsystem be correctly oriented space respond external torques forces properly attitude control subsystem consists sensors actuators together with controlling algorithms attitude-control subsystem permits proper pointing for science objective sun pointing for power solar arrays earth pointing for communications gnc guidance refers calculation commands usually done by cdh subsystem needed steer spacecraft where desired be navigation means determining spacecraft's orbital elements position control means adjusting path spacecraft meet mission requirements command data handling cdh subsystem receives commands from communications subsystem performs validation decoding commands distributes commands appropriate spacecraft subsystems components cdh also receives housekeeping data science data from other spacecraft subsystems components packages data for storage on data recorder transmission ground via communications subsystem other functions cdh include maintaining spacecraft clock state-of-health monitoring further information on-board data handling communications spacecraft both robotic crewed utilize various communications systems for communication with terrestrial stations well for communication between spacecraft space technologies utilized include rf optical communication addition some spacecraft payloads are explicitly for purpose ground–ground communication using receiver/retransmitter electronic technologies power spacecraft need electrical power generation distribution subsystem for powering various spacecraft subsystems for spacecraft near sun solar panels are frequently used generate electrical power spacecraft designed operate more distant locations for example jupiter might employ radioisotope thermoelectric generator rtg generate electrical power electrical power sent through power conditioning equipment before passes through power distribution unit over electrical bus other spacecraft components batteries are typically connected bus via battery charge regulator batteries are used provide electrical power during periods when primary power not available for example when low earth orbit spacecraft eclipsed by earth thermal control spacecraft must be engineered withstand transit through earth's atmosphere space environment they must operate vacuum with temperatures potentially ranging across hundreds degrees celsius well if subject reentry presence plasmas material requirements are such that either high melting temperature low density materials such beryllium reinforced carbon–carbon possibly due lower thickness requirements despite its high density tungsten ablative carbon–carbon composites are used depending on mission profile spacecraft may also need operate on surface another planetary body thermal control subsystem can be passive dependent on selection materials with specific radiative properties active thermal control makes use electrical heaters certain actuators such louvers control temperature ranges equipments within specific ranges spacecraft propulsion spacecraft may may not have propulsion subsystem depending on whether not mission profile calls for propulsion swift spacecraft example spacecraft that does not have propulsion subsystem typically though leo spacecraft include propulsion subsystem for altitude adjustments drag make-up maneuvers inclination adjustment maneuvers propulsion system also needed for spacecraft that perform momentum management maneuvers components conventional propulsion subsystem include fuel tankage valves pipes thrusters thermal control system interfaces with propulsion subsystem by monitoring temperature those components by preheating tanks thrusters preparation for spacecraft maneuver structures spacecraft must be engineered withstand launch loads imparted by launch vehicle must have point attachment for all other subsystems depending on mission profile structural subsystem might need withstand loads imparted by entry into atmosphere another planetary body landing on surface another planetary body payload payload depends on mission spacecraft typically regarded part spacecraft that pays bills typical payloads could include scientific instruments cameras telescopes particle detectors for example cargo human crew ground segment main article ground segment ground segment though not technically part spacecraft vital operation spacecraft typical components ground segment use during normal operations include mission operations facility where flight operations team conducts operations spacecraft data processing storage facility ground stations radiate signals receive signals from spacecraft voice
