joyce e george loraine cited by oxford english dictionary for using term joystick his diary when he went pau learn fly at bleriot's school george was pioneer aviator who with his colleague jobling built flew biplane at newcastle england he alleged have invented george stick which became more popularly known joystick george jobling aircraft control column collection discovery museum newcastle upon tyne england joysticks were present early planes though their mechanical origins are uncertain coining term joystick may actually be credited loraine his earliest known usage term although he most certainly did not invent device electronic joysticks history electrical two-axis joystick was invented by c b mirick at united states naval research laboratory nrl patented us patent no nrl was actively developing remote controlled aircraft at time joystick was possibly used support this effort awarded patent mirick writes my control system particularly applicable maneuvering aircraft without pilot germans developed electrical two-axis joystick around device was used part germans' funkgerät fug kehl radio control transmitter system used certain german bomber aircraft used guide both rocket-boosted anti-ship missile henschel hs unpowered pioneering precision-guided munition fritz-x against maritime other targets here joystick kehl transmitter was used by operator steer missile towards its target this joystick had on-off switches rather than analogue sensors both hs fritz-x used fug straßburg radio receivers them send kehl's control signals ordnance's control surfaces comparable joystick unit was used for contemporary american azon steerable munition strictly laterally steer munition yaw axis only this german invention was picked up by someone team scientists assembled at heeresversuchsanstalt peenemünde here part team on german rocket program was developing wasserfall missile variant v-2 rocket first ground-to-air missile wasserfall steering equipment converted electrical signal radio signals transmitted these missile 1960s use joysticks became widespread radio-controlled model aircraft systems such kwik fly produced by phill kraft now-defunct kraft systems firm eventually became important oem supplier joysticks computer industry other users first use joysticks outside radio-controlled aircraft industry may have been control powered wheelchairs such permobil during this time period nasa used joysticks control devices part apollo missions for example lunar lander test models were controlled with joystick many modern airliners aircraft for example all airbus aircraft developed from 1980s joystick has received new lease on life for flight control form side-stick controller similar gaming joystick but which used control flight replacing traditional yoke sidestick saves weight improves movement visibility cockpit may be safer accident than traditional control yoke electronic games ch products mach analog joystick used with many early home computer systems small knobs are for mechanical calibration sliders engage self-centering springs ralph h baer inventor television video games magnavox odyssey console released created first video game joysticks they were able control horizontal vertical position spot displayed on screen earliest known electronic game joystick with fire button was released by sega part their arcade game missile shooter simulation game that used part early dual-control scheme where two directional buttons are used move motorized tank two-way joystick used shoot steer missile onto oncoming planes displayed on screen when plane hit explosion animated on screen along with explosion sound game was released north america sami by midway games taito released four-way joystick part their arcade racing video game astro race while their run gun multi-directional shooter game western gun introduced dual-stick controls with one eight-way joystick for movement other for changing shooting direction north america was released by midway under title gun fight taito released interceptor early first-person combat flight simulator that involved piloting jet fighter using eight-way joystick aim with crosshair shoot at enemy aircraft atari standard joystick developed for atari released was digital joystick with single fire button connected via de-9 connector electrical specifications which were for much years de facto standard digital joystick specification joysticks were commonly used controllers first second generation game consoles but they gave way familiar game pad with nintendo entertainment system sega master system during mid-1980s though joysticks—especially arcade-style one—were are popular after-market add-ons for any console sega's third-person arcade rail shooter game space harrier introduced true analog flight stick used for movement its analog joystick could register movement any direction well measure degree push which could move player character at different speeds depending on how far joystick pushed certain direction distinct variation analog joystick positional gun which works differently from light gun instead using light sensors positional gun essentially analog joystick mounted fixed location that records position gun determine where player aiming on screen often used for arcade gun games with early examples including sega's sea devil taito's attack cross fire nintendo's battle shark saitek's cyborg gold around 2000s note its throttle its extra buttons its hat switch during 1990s joysticks such ch products flightstick gravis phoenix microsoft sidewinder logitech wingman thrustmaster fcs were demand with pc gamers they were considered prerequisite for flight simulators such f-16 fighting falcon lhx attack chopper joysticks became especially popular with mainstream success space flight simulator games like x-wing wing commander well six degrees freedom shooter descent however since beginning 21st century these types games have waned popularity are now considered dead genre with that gaming joysticks have been reduced niche products nowgamer's interview with jim boone producer at volition inc he stated that freespace 2's poor sales could have been due joysticks' being sold poorly because they were going out fashion because more modern first-person shooters such quake were very much about mouse keyboard he went further on state before that when we did descent for example was perfectly common for people have joysticks – we sold lot copies descent was around that time more modern fps with mouse keyboard came out opposed just keyboard like wolfenstein something since late 1990s analog sticks thumbsticks due their being controlled by one's thumbs have become standard on controllers for video game consoles popularized by nintendo's nintendo controller have ability indicate stick's displacement from its neutral position this means that software does not have keep track position estimate speed at which controls are moved these devices usually use potentiometers determine position stick though some newer models instead use hall effect sensor for greater reliability reduced size arcade sticks main article arcade controller arcade stick large-format controller for use with home consoles computers they use stick-and-button configuration some arcade cabinets such those with particular multi-button arrangements for example six button layout arcade games street fighter ii mortal kombat cannot be comfortably emulated on console joypad so licensed home arcade sticks for these games have been manufactured for home consoles pcs hat switch hat switch - at top green hat switch control on some joysticks also known pov point view switch allows one look around one's virtual world browse menus etc for example many flight simulators use switch player's views while other games sometimes use substitute for d-pad computer gamepads with both analogue stick d-pad

manufacturing applications such cranes assembly lines forestry equipment mining trucks excavators fact use such joysticks such high demand that has virtually replaced traditional mechanical control lever nearly all modern hydraulic control systems additionally most unmanned aerial vehicles uavs submersible remotely operated vehicles rovs require at least one joystick control either vehicle on-board cameras sensors and/or manipulators due highly hands-on rough nature such applications industrial joystick tends be more robust than typical video-game controller able function over high cycle life this led development employment hall effect sensing such applications 1980s means contactless sensing several companies produce joysticks for industrial applications using hall effect technology another technology used joystick design use strain gauges build force transducers from which output proportional force applied rather than physical deflection miniature force transducers are used additional controls on joysticks for menu selection functions some larger manufacturers joysticks are able customize joystick handles grips specific oem needs while small regional manufacturers often concentrate on selling standard products at higher prices smaller oems assistive technology specialist joysticks classed assistive technology pointing device are used replace computer mouse for people with fairly severe physical disabilities rather than controlling games these joysticks control pointer they are often useful people with athetoid conditions such cerebral palsy who find them easier grasp than standard mouse miniature joysticks are available for people with conditions involving muscular weakness such muscular dystrophy motor neurone disease well they are also used on electric powered wheelchairs for control since they are simple effective use control method see also list computer hardwares aircraft flight control system arcade joystick flight
