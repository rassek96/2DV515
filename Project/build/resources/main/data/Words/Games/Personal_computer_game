around central star each attempting destroy other although personal computers only became popular with development microprocessor microcomputer computer gaming on mainframes minicomputers had previously already existed oxo adaptation tic-tac-toe for edsac debuted another pioneer computer game was developed when mit students martin graetz alan kotok with mit student steve russell developed spacewar on pdp-1 mainframe computer used for statistical calculations first generation computer games were often text adventures interactive fiction which player communicated with computer by entering commands through keyboard early text-adventure adventure was developed for pdp-11 minicomputer by will crowther expanded by don woods by 1980s personal computers had become powerful enough run games like adventure but by this time graphics were beginning become important factor games later games combined textual commands with basic graphics seen ssi gold box games such pool radiance bard's tale for example by late 1970s early 1980s games were developed distributed through hobbyist groups gaming magazines such creative computing later computer gaming world these publications provided game code that could be typed into computer played encouraging readers submit their own software competitions microchess was one first games for microcomputers which was sold public first sold microchess eventually sold over copies on cassette tape with second-generation video game consoles at time early home computer game companies capitalized on successful arcade games at time with ports clones popular arcade games by top-selling games for atari were ports frogger centipede while top-selling game for texas instruments ti-99/4a was space invaders clone ti invaders that same year pac-man was ported atari while donkey kong was licensed for coleco adam late atari attempted take legal action against unauthorized clones particularly pac-man clones despite some these predating atari's exclusive rights home versions namco's game industry crash aftermath see also video game crash video game market became flooded with poor-quality cartridge games created by numerous companies attempting enter market overproduction high-profile releases such atari adaptations pac-man et grossly underperformed popularity personal computers for education rose dramatically consumer interest console video games dwindled historical lows interest games on personal computers rose effects crash were largely limited console market established companies such atari posted record losses over subsequent years conversely home computer market boomed sales low-cost color computers such commodore rose record highs developers such electronic arts benefited from increasing interest platform north american console market experienced resurgence united states with release nintendo entertainment system nes europe computer gaming continued boom for many years after computers such zx spectrum bbc micro were successful european market where nes was not successful despite its monopoly japan north america only 8-bit console have any success europe would be sega master system meanwhile japan both consoles computers became major industries with console market dominated by nintendo computer market dominated by nec's pc-88 pc-98 key difference between western japanese computers at time was display resolution with japanese systems using higher resolution 640x400 accommodate japanese text which turn affected video game design allowed more detailed graphics japanese computers were also using yamaha's fm synth sound boards from early 1980s during 16-bit era commodore amiga atari st became popular europe while pc-98 sharp x68000 fm towns became popular japan amiga x68000 fm towns were capable producing near arcade -quality hardware sprite graphics sound quality when they first released mid-to-late 1980s growth ibm pc gaming ibm world's largest computer company introduced ibm personal computer pc byte that year stated that computer's speed sophistication made excellent gaming device ibm others sold some games like microsoft flight simulator pc's cga graphics speaker sound were poor most customers bought powerful but expensive computer for business from mid-1985 however what compute described wave inexpensive ibm pc clones from american asian companies such tandy caused prices decline by end equivalent $1600 real ibm pc with 256k ram two disk drives cost little $600 lower than price apple iic consumers began purchasing dos computers for home large numbers their popularity caused consumer-software companies increase number ibm-compatible products including those developed specifically for pc opposed porting from other computers bing gordon electronic arts reported that customers used computers for games more than one fifth time whether purchased for work hobby with many who purchased computers for other reasons finding pc games pretty satisfying experience by pc market was growing so quickly that formerly business-only computer had become largest most important platform for computer game companies more than third games sold north america were for pc twice many those for apple ii even outselling those for commodore with ega video card inexpensive clone was better for games than commodore apple ii tandy 1000's enhanced graphics sound built-in joystick ports made best platform for ibm pc-compatible games before vga era by enormous popularity nintendo entertainment system had greatly affected computer-game industry koei executive claimed that nintendo's success has destroyed software entertainment market mindscape executive agreed saying that unfortunately its effect has been extremely negative without question nintendo's success has eroded software sales there's been much greater falling off disk sales than anyone anticipated third attributed end growth sales commodore console trip hawkins called nintendo last hurrah 8-bit world experts were unsure whether affected 16-bit computer games but hawkins nonetheless had deny rumors that electronic arts would withdraw from computers only produce console games by ascii entertainment reported at software publishing association conference that market for console games $59 billion revenue was times that computer-game market $430 million computer games however did not disappear by computer gaming world reported that industry moving toward heavy use vga graphics while some games were advertised with vga support at start year they usually supported ega graphics through vga cards by end however most publishers moved at supporting at least 320x200 mcga subset vga vga gave pc graphics that outmatched amiga increasing adoption computer mouse driven partially by success adventure games such highly successful king's quest series high resolution bitmap displays allowed industry include increasingly high-quality graphical interfaces new releases further improvements game artwork audio were made possible with introduction fm synthesis sound yamaha began manufacturing fm synth boards for computers early-mid-1980s by nec fm-7 computers had built-in fm sound first pc sound cards such adlib's music synthesizer card soon appeared these cards allowed ibm pc compatible computers produce complex sounds using fm synthesis where they had previously been limited simple tones beeps however rise creative labs sound blaster card released which featured much higher sound quality due inclusion pcm channel digital signal processor led adlib file for bankruptcy by also fm towns computer included built-in pcm sound addition cd-rom drive 24-bit color graphics by dos comprised 65% computer-game market with amiga at 10% all other computers including apple macintosh were below 10% declining although both apple ibm tried avoid customers associating their products with game machines latter acknowledged that vga audio joystick options for its ps/1 computer were popular id software produced early first-person shooter hovertank which was company's first their line highly influential games genre there were also several other companies that produced early first-person shooters such arsys software's star cruiser which featured fully polygonal graphics accolade's day viper id software went on develop wolfenstein which helped popularize genre kick-starting genre that would become one highest-selling modern times game was originally distributed through shareware distribution model allowing players try limited part game for free but requiring payment play rest represented one first uses texture mapping graphics popular game along with ultima underworld december computer gaming world reported that dos accounted for 82% computer-game sales compared macintosh's 8% amiga's 5% response reader's challenge find dos game that played better than amiga version magazine cited wing commander civilization added that heavy ms-dos emphasis cgw merely reflects realities market self-reported computer gaming world survey april similarly found that 91% readers primarily used ibm pcs compatibles for gaming compared 6% for amiga 3% for macintosh 1% for atari st while software publishing association study found that 74% personal computers were ibms compatible 10% macintosh 7% apple ii 8% other 51% ibm compatible had faster cpus by dos games such links pro supported super vga graphics while leading sega nintendo console systems kept their cpu speed at 3–7 mhz pc processor ran much faster allowing perform many more calculations per second release doom on pc was breakthrough graphics was soon ported various game consoles general shift toward greater realism cd-rom had much larger storage capacity than floppies helped reduce software piracy was less expensive produce chris crawford warned that was data-intensive technology not process-intensive one tempting developers emphasize quantity digital assets like art music over quality gameplay computer gaming world wrote that publishers may be losing their focus while many companies used additional storage release poor-quality shovelware collections older software enhanced versions existing ones new games such myst included many more assets for richer game experience enhance immersive experience with their unrealistic graphics electronic sound early pc games included extras such peril-sensitive sunglasses that shipped with hitchhiker's guide galaxy science fiction novella included with elite these extras gradually became less common but many games were still sold traditional oversized boxes that used hold extra feelies today such extras are usually found only special edition versions games such battlechests from blizzard contemporary gaming by pc games required much more memory than other software often consuming all conventional memory while peripheral device drivers could go into upper memory with dos memory managers players found modifying configsys autoexecbat files for memory management cumbersome confusing each game needed different configuration game les manley satirized this by depicting two beautiful women exhaust hero bed by requesting that he again explain difference between extended expanded memory computer gaming world provided technical assistance its writers help install games for review criticized nonstandard software like origin systems's infamous late unlamented voodoo memory manager which used unreal mode by growing popularity microsoft windows simplified device driver memory management success console titles such super mario increased interest hardware accelerated graphics on pcs soon resulted attempts produce affordable solutions with ati rage matrox mystique s3 virge tomb raider was one first third-person shooter games was praised for its revolutionary graphics graphics libraries such directx opengl matured knocked proprietary interfaces out market these platforms gained greater acceptance market particularly with their demonstrated benefits games such unreal however major changes microsoft windows operating system by then market leader made many older dos-based games unplayable on windows nt later windows xp without using emulator such dosbox faster graphics accelerators improving cpu technology resulted increasing levels realism computer games during this time improvements introduced with products such ati's radeon r300 nvidia 's geforce series have allowed developers increase complexity modern game engines pc gaming currently tends strongly toward improvements graphics unlike generally accepted push for improved graphical performance use physics engines computer games has become matter debate since announcement release nvidia physx ppu ostensibly competing with middleware such havok physics engine issues such difficulty ensuring consistent experiences for all players uncertain benefit first generation physx cards games such tom clancy's ghost recon advanced warfighter city villains prompted arguments over value such technology similarly many game publishers began experiment with new forms marketing chief among these alternative strategies episodic gaming adaptation older concept expansion packs which game content provided smaller quantities but for proportionally lower price titles such half-life episode one took advantage idea with mixed results rising from concerns for amount content provided for price platform characteristics fidelity high-end pc gaming pc will generally have far more processing resources at its disposal than other gaming systems game developers can use this improve visual fidelity their game relative other platforms but even if they do not games running on pc are likely benefit from higher screen resolution higher framerate anti-aliasing increased draw distance also common open world games better hardware also increases potential fidelity pc game's rules simulation pc games often support more players npcs than equivalents on other platforms game designs which depend on simulation large numbers tokens eg guild wars sid meier's civilization v are rarely seen anywhere else pc also supports greater input fidelity thanks its compatibility with wide array peripherals most common forms input are mouse/keyboard combination gamepads though touchscreens motion controllers are also available mouse particular lends players first-person shooter real-time strategy games on pc great speed accuracy openness defining characteristic pc platform absence centralized control all other gaming platforms except android devices extent are owned administered by single group advantages openness include reduced software cost prices are kept down by competition absence platform-holder fees games services are cheaper at every level many are free increased flexibility pc games decades old can be played on modern systems through emulation software if need be conversely newer games can often be run on older systems by reducing games' fidelity and/or scale increased innovation one does not need ask for permission release update pc game modify existing one platform's hardware software are constantly evolving these factors make pc centre both hardware software innovation by comparison closed platforms tend remain much same throughout their lifespan but there are also disadvantages including increased complexity pc general-purpose tool its inner workings are exposed owner misconfiguration can create enormous problems hardware compatibility issues are also possible game development complicated by wide variety hardware configurations developers may be forced limit their design run with sub-optimum pc hardware order reach larger pc market add range graphical other settings adjust for playability on individual machines requiring increased development test customer support resources increased hardware cost pc components are generally sold individually for profit even if one buys pre-built machine whereas hardware closed platforms mass-produced single unit often sold at smaller profit even loss with intention making profit instead online service fees developer kit profits reduced security difficult most situations ultimately impossible control way which pc hardware software used this leads far more software piracy cheating than closed platforms suffer from mods main article mod video gaming openness pc platform allows players edit their games distribute results over internet mods healthy mod community greatly increases game's longevity most popular mods have driven purchases their parent game record heights common for professional developers release tools they use create their games sometimes even source code order encourage modding but if game popular enough mods generally arise even without official support mods can compete with official downloadable content however even outright redistribute their ability extend lifespan game can work against its developers' plans for regular sequels game technology has become more complex has also become harder distribute development tools public modding has different connotation on consoles which are typically restricted much more heavily publicly released development tools are rare console mods usually refer hardware alterations designed remove restrictions dominant software although pc platform almost completely decentralized at hardware level there are two dominant software forces microsoft windows operating system steam distribution service microsoft introduced operating environment named windows on november add-on dos response growing interest graphical user interfaces guis microsoft windows came dominate world's personal computer market with over 90% market share overtaking mac os which had been introduced valve does not release any sales figures on its steam service instead only provides data companies with games on steam which they cannot release without permission due signing non-disclosure agreement with valve however stardock previous owner competing platform impulse estimated that steam had 70% share digital distribution market for video games early forbes reported that steam sales constituted 50–70% $4 billion market for downloaded pc games that steam offered game producers gross margins 70% purchase price compared with 30% at retail steam served over petabytes information double what had delivered digital distribution services main article digital distribution video games pc games are sold predominantly through internet with buyers downloading their new purchase directly their computer this approach allows smaller independent developers compete with large publisher-backed games avoids speed capacity limits optical discs which most other gaming platforms rely on valve corporation released steam platform for windows computers means distribute valve-developed video games such half-life would later see release on mac os x operating system was released on linux well by controlled 70% market for downloadable pc games with userbase about million accounts origin new version electronic arts online store was released order compete with steam other digital distribution platforms on pc period between now saw rise many digital distribution services on pc such amazon digital services gamestop gfwl ea store direct2drive gogcom gamersgate digital distribution also slashes cost circulation eliminates stock shortages allows games be released worldwide at no additional cost allows niche audiences be reached with ease however most digital distribution systems create ownership customer rights issues by storing access rights on distributor-owned computers games confer with these computers over internet before launching this raises prospect purchases being lost if distributor goes out business chooses lock buyer's account prevents resale ethics which are matter debate pc gaming technology exploded view modern personal computer display motherboard cpu microprocessor primary storage ram expansion cards graphics cards etc power supply optical disc drive secondary storage hard disk keyboard mouse main article personal computer see also gaming computer hardware modern computer games place great demand on computer's hardware often requiring fast central processing unit cpu function properly cpu manufacturers historically relied mainly on increasing clock rates improve performance their processors but had begun move steadily towards multi-core cpus by these processors allow computer simultaneously process multiple tasks called threads allowing use more complex graphics artificial intelligence in-game physics similarly games often rely on powerful graphics processing unit gpu which accelerates process drawing complex scenes realtime gpus may be integrated part computer's motherboard most common solution laptops come packaged with discrete graphics card with supply dedicated video ram connected motherboard through either agp pci-express port also possible use multiple gpus single computer using technologies such nvidia's scalable link interface ati's crossfire sound cards are also available provide improved audio computer games these cards provide improved audio provide audio enhancement that generally not available with integrated alternatives at cost marginally lower overall performance creative labs soundblaster line was for many years de facto standard for sound cards although its popularity dwindled pc audio became commodity on modern motherboards physics processing units ppus such nvidia physx formerly ageia physx card are also available accelerate physics simulations modern computer games ppus allow computer process more complex interactions among objects than achievable using only cpu potentially allowing players much greater degree control over world games designed use card virtually all personal computers use keyboard mouse for user input other common gaming peripherals are headset for faster communication online games joysticks for flight simulators steering wheels for driving games gamepads for console-style games software computer games also rely on third-party software such operating system os device drivers libraries more run today vast majority computer games are designed run on microsoft windows family operating systems whereas earlier games written for dos would include code communicate directly with hardware today application programming interfaces apis provide interface between game os simplifying game design microsoft's directx api that widely used by today's computer games communicate with sound graphics hardware opengl cross-platform api for graphics rendering that also used version graphics card's driver installed can often affect game performance gameplay late amd announced mantle low-level api for certain models amd graphics cards allowing for greater performance compared software-level apis such directx well simplifying porting from playstation xbox one consoles which are both built upon amd hardware not unusual for game company use third-party game engine third-party libraries for game's ai physics multiplayer main article multiplayer computer game local area network gaming see also lan party multiplayer gaming was largely limited local area networks lans before cost-effective broadband internet access became available due their typically higher bandwidth lower latency than dial-up services time these advantages allowed more players join any given computer game but have persisted today because higher latency most internet connections costs associated with broadband internet lan gaming typically requires two more personal computers router sufficient networking cables connect every computer on network additionally each computer must have its own copy spawn copy game order play optionally any lan may include external connection internet online games main article online game online multiplayer games have achieved popularity largely result increasing broadband adoption among consumers affordable high-bandwidth internet connections allow large numbers players play together thus have found particular use massively multiplayer online role-playing games tanarus persistent online games such world war ii online although possible participate online computer games using dial-up modems broadband internet connections are generally considered necessary order reduce latency between players commonly known lag such connections require broadband-compatible modem connected personal computer through network interface card generally integrated onto computer's motherboard optionally separated by router online games require virtual environment generally called game server these virtual servers inter-connect gamers allowing real time often fast paced action meet this subsequent need game server providers gsp have become increasingly more popular over last half decade while not required for all gamers these servers provide unique home fully customizable such additional modifications settings etc – giving end gamers experience they desire today there are over game servers hosted north america alone emulation main article emulator emulation software used run software without original hardware are popular for their ability play legacy video games without platform for which they were designed operating system emulators include dosbox dos emulator which allows playing games developed originally for this operating system thus not compatible with modern-day os console emulators such nestopia mame are relatively commonplace although complexity modern consoles such xbox playstation makes them far more difficult emulate even for original manufacturers most technically advanced consoles that can currently be successfully emulated for commercial games on pc are playstation using pcsx2 nintendo wii using dolphin emulator playstation emulator named rpcs3 currently works although can currently only run small homebrew games certain old arcade titles that were originally ported ps3 from older platforms most emulation software mimics particular hardware architecture often extremely high degree accuracy this particularly case with classic home computers such commodore whose software often depends on highly sophisticated low-level programming tricks invented by game programmers demoscene controversy main article video game controversy pc games have long been source controversy particularly related violence that has become commonly associated with video gaming general debate surrounds influence objectionable content on social development minors with organizations such american psychological association concluding that video game violence increases children's aggression concern that prompted further investigation by centers for disease control september industry groups have responded by noting responsibility parents governing their children's activities while attempts united states control sale objectionable games have generally been found unconstitutional video game addiction another cultural aspect gaming draw criticism can have negative influence on health on social relations problem addiction its health risks seems have grown with rise massively multiplayer online role playing games mmorpgs alongside social health problems associated with computer game addiction have grown similar worries about effect computer games on education computer games museums see also video game § museums there are several computer
