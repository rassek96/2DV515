examples game design theory main article game studies game studies gaming theory discipline that deals with critical study games game design players their role society culture prior late-twentieth century academic study games was rare limited fields such history anthropology video game revolution took off early 1980s so did academic interest games resulting field that draws on diverse methodologies schools thought these influences may be characterized broadly three ways social science approach humanities approach industry engineering approach broadly speaking social scientific approach has concerned itself with question what do games do people using tools methods such surveys controlled laboratory experiments ethnography researchers have investigated both positive negative impacts that playing games could have on people more sociologically informed research has sought move away from simplistic ideas gaming either 'negative' 'positive' but rather seeking understand its role location complexities everyday life general terms humanities approach has concerned itself with question what meanings are made through games using tools methods such interviews ethnographies participant observation researchers have investigated various roles that videogames play people's lives activities together with meaning they assign their experiences from industry perspective lot game studies research can be seen academic response videogame industry's questions regarding products creates sells main question this approach deals with can be summarized how can we create better games with accompanying what makes game good good can be taken mean many different things including providing entertaining engaging experience being easy learn play being innovative having novel experiences different approaches studying this problem have included looking at describing how design games extracting guidelines rules thumb for making better games strategic decision making main article game theory game theory study strategic decision making specifically study mathematical models conflict cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers alternative term suggested more descriptive name for discipline interactive decision theory subject first addressed zero-sum games such that one person's gains exactly equal net losses other participant participants today however game theory applies wide range behavioral relations has developed into umbrella term for logical side decision science games studied game theory are well-defined mathematical objects be fully defined game must specify following elements players game information actions available each player at each decision point payoffs for each outcome rasmusen refers these four essential elements by acronym papi game theorist typically uses these elements along with solution concept their choosing deduce set equilibrium strategies for each player such that when these strategies are employed no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy these equilibrium strategies determine equilibrium game—a stable state which either one outcome occurs set outcomes occur with known probability design elements games can be characterized by what player does this often referred gameplay major key elements identified this context are tools rules that define overall context game tools play games are often classified by components required play them eg miniatures ball cards board pieces computer places where use leather well established ball has been popular game piece throughout recorded history resulting worldwide popularity ball games such rugby basketball football cricket tennis volleyball other tools are more idiosyncratic certain region many countries europe for instance have unique standard decks playing cards other games such chess may be traced primarily through development evolution its game pieces many game tools are tokens meant represent other things token may be pawn on board play money intangible item such point scored games such hide-and-seek tag do not utilise any obvious tool rather their interactivity defined by environment games with same similar rules may have different gameplay if environment altered for example hide-and-seek school building differs from same game park auto race can be radically different depending on track street course even with same cars rule development see also game mechanics gameplay balance game design whereas games are often characterized by their tools they are often defined by their rules while rules are subject variations changes enough change rules usually results new game there are exceptions this that some games deliberately involve changing their own rules but even then there are often immutable meta-rules rules generally determine turn order rights responsibilities players each player's goals player rights may include when they may spend resources move tokens victory conditions common win conditions are being first amass certain quota points tokens settlers catan having greatest number tokens at end game monopoly some relationship one's game tokens those one's opponent chess's checkmate single multiplayer most games require multiple players however single-player games are unique respect type challenges player faces many games described single-player may be termed actually puzzles recreations unlike game with multiple players competing with against each other reach game's goal one-player game battle solely against element environment artificial opponent against one's own skills against time against chance storyline plot stories told games may focus on narrative elements that can be communicated through use mechanics player choice narrative plots games generally have clearly defined simplistic structure mechanical choices on part designers often drastically effect narrative elements game however due lack unified standardized teaching understanding narrative elements games individual interpretations methods terminology vary wildly because this most narrative elements games are created unconsciously intuitively however general rule game narratives increase complexity scale player choice game mechanics increase complexity scale one example this removing players ability directly affect plot for limited time this lack player choice necessitates increase mechanical complexity could be used metaphor symbolize depression that felt by character narrative luck strategy game's tools rules will result its requiring skill strategy luck combination thereof are classified accordingly games skill include games physical skill such wrestling tug war hopscotch target shooting stake games mental skill such checkers chess games strategy include checkers chess go arimaa tic-tac-toe often require special equipment play them games chance include gambling games blackjack mah-jongg roulette etc well snakes ladders rock paper scissors most require equipment such cards dice most games contain two all three these elements for example american football baseball involve both physical skill strategy while tiddlywinks poker monopoly combine strategy chance many card board games combine all three most trick-taking games involve mental skill strategy element chance do many strategic board games such risk settlers catan carcassonne use educational tool further information learning through play by learning through play children can develop social cognitive skills mature emotionally gain self-confidence required engage new experiences environments key ways that young children learn include playing being with other people being active exploring new experiences talking themselves communication with others meeting physical mental challenges being shown how
