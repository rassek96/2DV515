second life from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search this article about virtual community for portuguese film see second life film has been suggested that second life research be merged into this article discuss proposed since february second life developers linden lab initial release june years ago beta stable release / may months ago platform microsoft windows vista higher mac os x higher linux i686 x86-64 license mixed portions proprietary client open source website secondlifecom second life online virtual world developed by linden lab based san francisco launched on june by second life had approximately million regular users according linden lab which owns second life many ways second life similar mmorpgs massively multiplayer online role playing games however linden lab emphatic that their creation not game there no manufactured conflict no set objective virtual world can be accessed freely via linden lab's own client programs via alternative third party viewers second life users also called residents create virtual representations themselves called avatars are able interact with other avatars places objects they can explore world known grid meet other residents socialize participate individual group activities build create shop trade virtual property services with one another platform that principally features 3d-based user-generated content second life also has its own virtual currency linden dollar which exchangeable with real world currency second life intended for people aged over with exception 13–15-year-old users restricted second life

linden lab with intention developing computer hardware allow people become immersed virtual world its earliest form company struggled produce commercial version hardware known rig which prototype form was seen clunky steel contraption with computer monitors worn on shoulders that vision changed into software application linden world which people participated task-based games socializing three-dimensional online environment that effort eventually transformed into better known user-centered second life although he was familiar with metaverse neal stephenson's novel snow crash rosedale has said that his vision virtual worlds predates that book that he conducted early virtual world experiments during his college years at university california san diego where he studied physics second life began receive lot media attraction including cover story on businessweek magazine featuring virtual world second life avatar anshe chung by that time anshe chung had become second life's poster child symbol for economic opportunities that virtual world offers its residents at same time service saw period exponential growth its user base on december cory ondrejka who helped program second life was forced resign chief technology officer january residents spent total hours inworld on average residents were logged at any particular moment maximum concurrency number avatars inworld recorded 1st qtr on march rosedale announced plans step down from his position linden lab ceo become chairman linden lab's board directors rosedale announced mark kingdon new ceo effective may kingdon was replaced by rosedale who took over interim ceo after four months rosedale abruptly stepped down from interim ceo position was announced october that bob komin linden lab's chief financial officer chief operating officer would take over ceo job for immediate future second life was honored at 59th annual technology & engineering emmy awards for advancing development online sites with user-generated content rosedale accepted award may concurrent users averaged about may concurrent users averaged about according tateru nino engadget decline was due new policies implemented by linden lab reducing number bots campers june linden lab announced layoffs 30% its workforce november million accounts were registered although company has not made public figures for actual long-term consistent usage however wagner james au who blogs writes about second life said april that he had on good authority that second life's actual active userbase about classification during meeting with investors rosedale noticed that participants were particularly responsive collaborative creative potential second life result initial objective-driven gaming focus second life was shifted more user-created community-driven experience second life's status virtual world computer game talker frequently debated unlike traditional computer game second life does not have designated objective nor traditional game play mechanics rules can also be argued that second life multi-user virtual world because virtual world centered around interaction between multiple users does not have any stipulated goals irrelevant talk about winning losing relation second life likewise unlike traditional talker second life contains extensive world that can be explored interacted with can be used purely creative tool set if user so chooses march while speaking at google techtalks rosedale said so we don't see this game we see platform second life used offer two main grids one for adults 18+ one for teens august linden lab closed teen grid due operating costs since then users aged over can sign up for free account other limited accounts are available for educators who use second life with younger students there are three activity-based classifications called ratings for sims second life general formerly pg—no extreme violence nudity moderate formerly mature—some violence swearing adult situations some nudity adult may contain overt sexual activity nudity violence residents avatars main article resident second life human female avatar several avatars together there no charge for creating second life account for making use world for any period time linden lab reserves right charge for creation large numbers multiple accounts for single person per household per hours but at present does not do so premium membership us$995 monthly us$2250 quarterly us$72 annually extends access increased level technical support also pays automatic stipend l$300/week into member's avatar account after days that resident will receive l$700 bonus making l$1000 for that week this amount has decreased since original stipend l$500 which still paid older accounts certain accounts created during earlier period may receive l$400 this stipend if changed into usd means that actual cost for benefit extended tech support for annual payment us$72 only about us$14 depending on currency exchange rates however vast majority casual users second life do not upgrade beyond free basic account avatars may take any form users choose human animal vegetable mineral combination thereof residents may choose resemble themselves they are real life they may choose even more abstract forms given that almost every aspect avatar fully customizable second life culture consists many activities behaviors that are also present real life single resident account may have only one avatar at time although appearance this avatar can change between many different forms resident wishes avatar forms like almost everything else second life can be either created by user bought pre-made single person may also have multiple accounts thus appear be multiple residents person's multiple accounts are referred alts avatars can travel via walking running vehicular access flying teleportation because second life such vast virtual world teleportation used when avatars wish travel instantly efficiently once they reach their destination they may travel more conventional means at various speeds avatars can communicate via local chat group chat global instant messaging known im voice public private group chatting used for localized public conversations between two more avatars visible any avatar within given distance ims are used for private conversations either between two avatars among members group even between objects avatars unlike chatting im communication does not depend on participants being within certain distance each other version voice chat both local im was also available instant messages may optionally be sent resident's email when resident logged off although message length limited bytes economy main article economy second life avatar virtual world

linden can be exchanged for us dollars other currencies on market-based currency exchanges linden lab reports that second life economy generated us$3596674 economic activity during month september september second life was reported have gdp $64 million total size second life economy grew 65% us$567 million about 25% entire us virtual goods market gross resident earnings are us$55 million – 11% growth over linden labs released info graphic that showed that over years $32 billion transactions for virtual goods had exchanged between second life residents with average million daily transactions there high level entrepreneurial activity second life residents second life are able create virtual objects other content second life unique that users retain all rights their content which means they can use second life distribute sell their creations with million items listed on its online marketplace at its height circa hundreds thousands dollars were changing hands daily residents created sold wide variety virtual commodities second life also quickly became profitable due selling renting virtual real estate also saw second life's first real-world millionaire ailin graef better known anshe chung her avatar converted initial investment $995 usd into over one million dollars over course two half years she built her fortune primarily by buying selling renting virtual real estate major tech corporations have tried use second life market products services second life's tech-savvy audience for example ibm purchased islands within second life for virtual training simulations key businesses processes musicians podcasters news organizations including cnet reuters npr's infinite mind bbc all established presence within second life virtual goods include buildings vehicles devices all kinds animations clothing skin hair jewelry flora fauna works art services include camping wage labor business management entertainment custom content creation which can be broken up into following six categories building texturing scripting animating art direction position producer/project funder l$ can be purchased using us dollars other currencies on lindex exchange provided by linden lab independent brokers other resident users money obtained from currency sales most commonly used pay second life's own subscription tier fees only relatively small number users earn large amounts money from world according figures published by linden lab about users made profit second life february whom made less than us$10 while made more than us$5000 profits are derived from selling virtual goods renting land broad range services accessibility alternative user interfaces since second life viewer was made open-source number accessibility solutions have been developed listed chronological order modification second life viewer has been developed that allows users who are visually impaired navigate their avatar using force feedback different object types are distinguished through different vibration frequencies textsl web-based client developed by university nevada that allows users who are visually impaired access second life using built speech synthesis textsl allows users who are visually impaired navigate communicate with avatars interact with objects using command based interface inspired by zork adventure game this web interface also accessible using smartphone ibm's human ability accessibility center with ibm virtual universe community developed web-based interface for second life that can be accessed with screen reader this client provides basic navigation communication perception functions using hotkeys max virtual guidedog developed by virtual helping hands offers virtual guide dog object that can be worn by user's avatar guidedog provides number functions such navigation querying environment through chat-like interface feedback provided using synthetic speech metabolt open source text client developed by metabolt development team which fully accessible also compatible with accessibility client applications microsoft platforms only such jaws sltalker talker-like text-based interface for second life user can connect using telnet-ssl any talker mud client that supports ssl secure connections study showed that one biggest barriers making second life accessible visually impaired users its apparent lack metadata such names descriptions for virtual world objects this similar problem for accessibility web where images may lack alternative tags study found that 32% objects second life are simply named object up 40% lack accurate names language localization brazil became first country have its own independently run portal second life operated by intermediary—although actual second life grid accessed through brazilian portal same that used by rest worldwide customer base portal called mainland brazil run by kaizen games making kaizen first partner linden's global provider program october linden lab signed second global provider program with t-entertainment co ltd seoul south korea t-entertainment's portal called sera korea serves gateway second life grid previously starting late linden lab had opened run their own welcome area portals regions for german korean japanese language speakers public chat within world supports many written languages character sets providing ability for people chat their native languages several resident-created translation devices provide machine translation public chat using various online translation services allowing for communication between residents who speak different languages most versions viewer have language translation built into them within current generation second life viewer linden labs has incorporated language translation from google land ownership main article real estate second life premium membership allows resident own land with first m² main land owned by holder premium account free usual monthly land use fee referred by residents tier because charged tiers there no upper limit on tier at highest level user pays us$295 for their first m² any land must first be purchased from either linden lab private seller there are four types land regions mainland private region homestead openspace region comprises area m2 acres area being meters on each side mainland regions form one continuous land mass while private regions are islands openspace regions may be either mainland private but have lower prim limits traffic use levels than mainland regions owners private region enjoy access some additional controls that are not available mainland owners for example they have greater ability alter shape land residents must own region either mainland private qualify for purchasing openspace region linden lab usually sells only complete m2 acres regions at auction although smaller parcels are auctioned on occasion typically land parcels abandoned by users who have left once residents buy land they may resell freely use for any purpose that not prohibited by second life terms service residents may also choose purchase rent land from another resident resident landlord rather than from linden lab on private region built-in land selling controls allow landlord sell land region another resident while still retaining some control residents purchasing renting land from any other party than linden lab are not required hold premium membership nor necessarily pay tier fee although typically landlord will require some form upfront monthly fee compensate them for their liability pay land use fee charged by linden lab however linden lab acknowledges only landlord owner land will not intervene disputes between residents this means for example that landlord can withdraw resident's land from availability without refunding their money linden lab will not arbitrate dispute unless clear-cut matter 'land fraud' users can report such matters linden lab if they occur they will look into land types second life land

fees fee sets both land area prim count there are only few grandfathered high prim islands which are otherwise identical regular islands but have higher limit set server software they can be resold but are rarely available for purchase grids grid made regions each square side = meters regions without servers appear deep sea cannot be entered cannot be flown over but regions with servers can be seen across regions without servers but user's point view can enter region without server full grid square with sides meters for total area 72×109 km2 roughly times earth's surface area supports up more than regions but all most regions with servers are extreme northwest corner this vast theoretical area april km2 this area was allocated actual regions little smaller than country luxembourg some regions grid are intended recreate famous places cities that exist real life fiction technology second life comprises viewer also known client executing on user's personal computer several thousand servers operated by linden lab client screenshot second life virtual world through early stage open source rendering engine using libsecondlife linden lab provides official viewers for microsoft windows mac os x most distributions linux viewer renders graphics using opengl technology viewer source code was released under gpl moved lgpl there are now several mature third party viewer projects that contain features not available linden lab 'official' client target other platforms cater specialist & accessibility needs main focus third party development exploring new ideas working with linden lab deliver new functionality independent project libopenmetaverse offers function library for interacting with second life servers libopenmetaverse has been used create non-graphic third party viewers there are several alternate viewers published by linden lab used for software testing by volunteers for early access upcoming projects some these clients only function on beta grid consisting limited number regions running various releases unstable test server code server each full region area 256×256 meters second life grid runs on single dedicated core multi-core server homestead regions

physics simulation manage collisions interactions all objects that region objects can be nonphysical non-moving actively physical movable complex shapes may be linked together groups up separate primitives additionally each player's avatar treated physical object so that may interact with physical objects world july second life simulators use havok physics engine for all in-world dynamics this engine capable simulating thousands physical objects at once linden lab pursues use open standards technologies uses free open source software such apache mysql squid linux plan move everything open standards by standardizing second life protocol cory ondrejka former cto second life stated that while after everything has been standardized both client server will be released free open source software opensimulator main article opensimulator january opensimulator was founded open source simulator project aim this project develop full open source server software for second life clients opensim bsd licensed written c can run under mono environment there were some alternative grids using opensimulator virtual technology virtual commercial airliner graphics linden scripting language havok physics engine enable simulation various real imagined machines devices there are many light houses some with detailed fresnel lenses steampunk buoyant airships are also common there are combat weapons systems large part linden scripting language guide describes features available for modeling vehicles popular uses this include cars boats motorcycles airplanes manned vehicles have advantages but there can also be autonomous remotely controlled vehicles major obstacle region sim border crossings which unlike cell phone handoffs are problem for users even at walking speed recent work by linden lab has greatly improved this if user question has few resources assigned him her crossing can be almost seamless second life physics based on computer game physics consists mostly avoidance interpenetration avatars other physical objects with other objects physical not but for physical objects most importantly vehicles there approximation real world motion avatars can sit on vehicles their users can control them scripting language includes many system calls specialized for vehicles define their movement control but correspondence real world motion not quantitatively defined second life vehicles typically act like real world vehicles only superficial ways some extent differences are needed deal with sim crossing problem including oldest known bug second life software time step at best about 1/40 sec internet communication latency lag so forth for some types moving objects fairly high degree realism possible within these limits but with provided system calls simpler motions are easier script applications arts main article arts second life second life residents express themselves creatively through virtual world adaptations art exhibits live music live theater machinima well other art forms competitive entertainment wide variety recreational activities both competitive non-competitive take place on second life grid including both traditional sports video game-like scenarios education main article education second life second life used platform for education by many institutions such colleges universities libraries government entities since university san martin de porres peru has been developing second life prototypes peruvian archeological buildings training teachers for this new paradigm education embassies maldives was first country open embassy second life maldives' embassy located on second life's diplomacy island where visitors will be able talk face-to-face with computer-generated ambassador about visas trade other issues diplomacy island also hosts diplomatic museum diplomatic academy island established by diplofoundation part virtual diplomacy project may sweden became second country open embassy second life run by swedish institute embassy serves promote sweden's image culture rather than providing any real virtual services swedish minister for foreign affairs carl bildt stated on his blog that he hoped he would get invitation grand opening september publicis group announced project creating serbia island part project serbia under construction project officially supported by ministry diaspora serbian government was stated that island will feature nikola tesla museum guča trumpet festival exit festival was also planned on opening virtual info terminals ministry diaspora on tuesday december estonia became third country open embassy second life september colombia serbia opened embassies macedonia philippines have opened embassies diplomatic island second life albania opened embassy nova bay location sl israel was inaugurated january effort showcase israel global audience though without any connection official israeli diplomatic channels malta djibouti are also planning open virtual missions second life religion religious organizations have also begun open virtual meeting places within second life early lifechurchtv christian church headquartered edmond oklahoma with eleven campuses us created experience island opened its twelfth campus second life church reported we find that this creates less-threatening environment where people are much more willing explore discuss spiritual things july anglican cathedral was established second life mark brown head group that built cathedral noted that there interest what i call depth moving away from light fluffy christianity first unitarian universalist congregation second life was established services have been held regularly making fuucsl congregation one longest-running active congregations second life egyptian-owned news website islam online has purchased land second life allow muslims non-muslims alike perform ritual hajj virtual reality form obtaining experience before actually making pilgrimage mecca person second life also offers several groups that cater needs interests humanists atheists agnostics freethinkers one most active groups sl humanism which has been holding weekly discussion meetings inside second life every sunday since relationships relationships are common second life including some couples who have married online social engagement offered by online environment helps those who might be socially isolated addition sex often encountered however access adult sections requires age verification there also large bdsm community second life relationships have been taken from virtual online relationships into personal real-world relationships booperkit moseley shukran fahid were possibly first couple meet second life then marry real life booperkit travelled america meet shukran he returned england with her after one week they married had twin boys are still married some couples meet online form friendships eventually move finding one another real world some even have their weddings on second life well real-world setting relationships virtual worlds have added dimension compared other social media because avatars give feeling proximity making voyeur experience more intense than simply textual encounter complexities those encounters depend on engagement levels people behind avatars whether they are engaging disassociatively entertainment only immersively if avatar was them augmentatively meaning they engage for real life purpose role-playing role-play at 1920s berlin project 1880s victorian london role-play sim second life there are many destinations within second life which are dedicated those who enjoy role-playing some these are sexual nature while others focus on themes such fantasy history science fiction other subjects many these types worlds have very specific sets rules that each avatar who visits expected follow such rules can include things such dress code code behavior world guidelines if these rules are not followed avatar can be booted from world by game administrator one example one these role-playing worlds realm valahari this particular world takes place fantasy medieval setting order exist within that world your avatar must be dressed fantasy medieval attire case your avatar does not already own such clothing world provides clothing shops for you area which you visit before you actually enter world however none these clothing shops provide free items all them cost linden dollars l$ within world everyone also expected maintain role-playing atmosphere anyone who using regular everyday language tends be frowned upon seen outsider by other members realm regular language be kept private chat windows so that fantasy/medieval atmosphere not polluted by another example are historical role-playing sims such 1880s victorian london 1920s berlin project while only encouraged do so 1880s victorian london visitors 1920s berlin project are required dress accurately part history based immersive experience sims may incorporate rules that have less do with thematic realism more do with adhering community guidelines for instance one rule that commonly seen prohibition restriction underage avatars role-playing sims that feature sexual content these rules are separate from linden labs' sim restrictions they restrict underage characters played by adult players second life also features roleplay worlds based on other successful fictional franchises one such example would be midgar roleplay sim based on popular video game final fantasy vii which has been established since though copyright legality such locations hotly disputed role-play sims are usually either non-metered script metered use sim server health meter non-metered combat sims all fighting done through paragraph rp usually with assistance role-play dice players may determine outcome they desire privately ims then role-play out ending character using public chat metered combat sims players carry weapons that are scripted act conjunction with meter players are then able fight using these weapons and/or any capabilities built into meter itself until one player's health expires they die they are either resurrected by another player automatically revive after certain period time are returned their home sim position with their full health restored some metered combat sims allow for non-metered combat be used under certain circumstances these cases method combat used depends upon preferences participants given scene integration between content purchases provision role-playing content has occasionally caused controversy second life some examples include user may use real money transferred via l$ purchase clothing items for role-playing area only be banned from that area have value those items wiped out intrusive role-play which avatars role-play disruptive way areas that are not intended for role-playing has caused problems past examples include avatars dressing police officers claiming have authority over areas that have nothing do with them previously sold system which allowed avatars play vampires bite any other avatar steal their soul some new users were convinced this would have permanent effect on their avatar even paid purchase role-playing items restore their soul unaware that effect was entirely irrelevant if player did not wish participate vampire role-play range avatar costumes items available much greater than range role-play areas range playable social roles meaning that users may purchase items not realizing that role they are advertised providing cannot exist this also applies weapons which are regulated differently across different role-playing sims chains sims some metered combat systems allow affiliated merchants develop weapons using their system's api this allows those merchants develop sell weapons that deal additional damage have other mechanical effects on combat these weapons are often more expensive than similar weapons that do not incorporate these enhancements depending upon specifics api merchant's weapons may end up being more powerful than combat system's developer intended these cases merchant's api privileges may be revoked resulting both developer's new pre-existing weapons losing their special abilities this eliminates much value weapons which have already been purchased by users using l$ science second life used for scientific research collaboration data visualization examples include scilands american chemical society's acs island genome virginia tech's slate nature publishing group's elucian islands village social network second life can be real-time immersive social space for people including those with physical mental disabilities that impair their first lives who often find comfort security interacting through anonymous avatars indeed some academics believe using second life might even help improve motor ability for people with parkinson’s disease work solutions second life gives companies option create virtual workplaces allow employees virtually meet hold events practice any kind corporate communications conduct training sessions immersive virtual learning environment simulate business processes prototype new products criticism controversy main article criticism second life number difficult issues have arisen around second life issues range from technical budgeting server resources moral pornography legal legal position linden dollar bragg v linden lab security issues have also been concern regulation past large portions second life economy consisted businesses that are now regulated banned changes second life's terms service this regard have largely had purpose bringing activity within second life into compliance with various international laws even though person running business may be full compliance with law their own country linden lab offer no compensation for businesses that are damaged destroyed by these rule changes which can render significant expenditure effort worthless on july linden lab announced ban on in-world gambling fear that new regulations on internet gambling could affect linden lab if was permitted continue ban was immediately met with in-world protests august $750000 in-world bank called ginko financial collapsed due bank run triggered by linden lab's ban on gambling which halved size second life economy aftershocks this collapse caused severe liquidity problems for other virtual banks which critics had long asserted were scams on tuesday january linden lab announced upcoming prohibition payment fixed interest on cash deposits unregulated banking activities in-world all banks without real-world charters closed converted virtual joint stock companies by january after ban few companies continue offer non-interest bearing deposit accounts residents such e-commerce site xstreet which had already adopted zero-interest policy months before linden lab interest ban technical issues second life has suffered from difficulties related system instability these include increased system latency intermittent client crashes however some faults are caused by system's use asset server cluster on which actual data governing objects stored separately from areas world avatars that use those objects communication between main servers asset cluster appears constitute bottleneck which frequently causes problems typically when asset server downtime announced users are advised not build manipulate objects engage business leaving them with little do but chat generally reducing confidence all businesses on grid another problem inventory loss which items user's inventory including those which have been paid for can disappear without warning permanently enter state where they will fail appear in-world when requested giving object missing from database error linden lab offers no compensation for items that are lost this way although policy change instituted allows accounts file support tickets when inventory loss occurs many in-world businesses will attempt compensate for this restore items although they are under no obligation do so not all are able do so recent change how company handles items which have lost their parent directory means that inventory loss much less problem resolves faster than recent years loss recovery times have gone from months never hours day two for majority users but inventory loss does still exist second life functions by streaming all data user live over internet with minimal local caching frequently used data user expected have minimum 300kbit/s internet bandwidth for basic functionality due proprietary communications protocols not possible use network proxy service reduce network load when many people are all using same location such when used for group activities school business fraud intellectual property protection although second life's client server incorporate digital rights management technology visual data object must ultimately be sent client order for be drawn thus unofficial third-party clients can bypass them one such program copybot was developed debugging tool enable objects be backed up but was immediately hijacked for use copying objects additionally programs that generally attack client-side processing data such glintercept can copy certain pieces data such use prohibited under second life tos could be prosecuted under dmca linden lab may ban user who observed using copybot similar client but will not ban user simply for uploading even selling copied content this case linden lab's enforcement intellectual property law limited that required by safe harbor provisions digital millennium copyright act which requires filing real-life lawsuit although few high-profile businesses second life have filed such lawsuits none cases filed date have gone trial most have been dismissed pursuant settlement agreement reached between parties overall majority businesses second life do not make enough money for lawsuit be worthwhile due real-life work commitments they cannot devote enough time complete one result many second life businesses their intellectual property remains effectively unprotected another case where settlement dismissal was gained may be found matter eros llc v linden research inc october case was transferred private mediation plaintiffs filed for dismissal charges on march there have also been issues with use false dmca takedown notices once dmca takedown notice served reversing requires individual expose his personal information filer filing notice does not require this for penalty perjury be enacted lawsuit required anything less false dmca claimer can just claim from different account every week causing legitimate business unlimited losses addition technical process removal re-instatement content on second life subject failure which can result content becoming unusable its owner this does not effectively prevent content theft thief who subject dmca takedown notice will not challenge but will simply create new account re-upload content often releasing with all permissions available maximize propagation out spite most users world paying private individuals are likewise effectively unprotected common forms fraud taking place in-world include bogus investment pyramid schemes fake hacked vendors failure honor land rental agreements group virtual landowners online have filed class
