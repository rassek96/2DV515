keyboard for each finger home row keys are circled index fingers are placed on f j remaining fingers fall shown fingers then match their colours on keyboard alternative method for top row described section other methods split keyboards often support this alternate method touch typing also called touch type touch keyboarding typing without using sense sight find keys specifically touch typist will know their location on keyboard through muscle memory touch typing typically involves placing eight fingers horizontal row along middle keyboard home row having them reach for other keys both two-handed touch typing one-handed touch typing are possible frank edward mcgurrin court stenographer from salt lake city utah who taught typing classes reportedly invented touch typing on standard keyboard for english speakers home row keys are asdf for left hand jkl for right hand keyboard called qwerty keyboard because these are first six letters on keyboard most modern computer keyboards have raised dot bar on home keys for index fingers help touch typists maintain rediscover correct position on keyboard quickly with no need look at keys more recently ability touch type on touchscreen phones has been made possible with use specialized virtual keyboard software for touch typing contents history advantages o speed o reduced switching attention o disputes over advantages training o home row repetitive stress injuries other methods see also references history learning touch type do you not find he said that with your short sight little tiring do so much typewriting i did at first she answered but now i know where letters are without looking arthur conan doyle case identity original layouts for first few mechanical typewriters were alphabetical order abcde etc but frequent jams suffered by experienced typists forced manufacturers change layout letters placing keys that are often pressed sequence far possible from each other this allows engaging second printing bar typewriter before first falls down increasing speed mechanism equal distribution load over most fingers also increased speed keys mechanical typewriter are more difficult press calculations for keyboard layout were based on language being typed this meant different keyboard layouts would be needed for each language english speaking countries for example first row qwerty but french speaking countries azerty though mechanical typewriters are now rarely used moves change layout increase speed have been largely ignored resisted due familiarity with existing layout among touch typists on july mcgurrin who was reportedly only person using touch typing at time won decisive victory over louis traub operating caligraph with eight-finger method typing contest held cincinnati results were displayed on front pages many newspapers mcgurrin won us$500 equivalent $12580 usd popularized new typing method whether mcgurrin was actually first person touch type simply first be popularly noticed disputed speeds attained by other typists other typing competitions at time suggest that they must have been using similar systems bates torrey coined words writing by touch his article lovisa ellen bullard barnes defined words write by touch her book follows learn write by touch that with only occasional glance at key-board sit directly front machine keep hands nearly possible one position over key-board most common other form typing search peck typing two-fingered typing this method slower than touch typing because instead relying on memorized position keys typist required find each key by sight move fingers greater distance many idiosyncratic styles between those two exist — for example many people will type blindly but using only two five fingers not always systematic way start position with fingers on home row standard finger placement on qwerty keyboard advantages speed touch type training can improve any individual's typing speed accuracy dramatically accepted average typing speed wpm words per minute professional career typists can exceed wpm repeatedly continuously secretarial data entry etc every individual learns at different pace routine practice required maintain high typing speed accuracy reduced switching attention touch typist does not need move sight between keyboard that obscured with fingers may be poorly lit other areas that require attention this increases productivity reduces number errors disputes over advantages there are many idiosyncratic typing styles between novice-style hunt peck touch typing for example many hunt peck typists have keyboard layout memorized are able type while focusing their gaze on screen one study examining subjects varying different styles expertise has found minimal difference typing speed between touch typists self-taught hybrid typists according study number fingers does not determine typing speed people using self-taught typing strategies were found be fast trained typists instead number fingers there are other factors that predict typing speed fast typists keep their hands fixed on one position instead moving them over keyboard more consistently use same finger type certain letter quote doctoral candidate anna feit we were surprised observe that people who took typing course performed at similar average speed accuracy those that taught typing themselves only used fingers on average training touch typist starts by placing their fingers on start position middle row knows which finger move how much move for reaching any required key learning typically includes first printing exercises containing only letters on near standard position then gradually mastering other rows important learn placing fingers into start position blindly hands are frequently raised from keyboard operate line feed lever past more recently computer mouse keys f j frequently contain some surface features that allow typist recognize them by touch alone thus removing need look down at keys reset fingers at home row typing speed can be increased gradually speeds wpm higher can be achieved rate speed increase varies between individuals many websites software products are available learn touch typing many these are free learning touch typing can be stressful both fingers well mind beginning but once learned decent level exerts minimal stress on fingers for individuals with past typing experience learning touch type particularly difficult due motivational reasons initial performance level touch typing far lower than visually guided typing therefore does not initially seem worthwhile study touch typing typing speed generally improves with practice while practicing important ensure that there are no weak keys typing speed typically determined by how slow these weak keys are typed rather than how fast remaining keys are typed if stage reached where irrespective amount practice typing speed not increasing advisable let some time pass continue serious practice thereafter typing speeds typically tend increase with time even when no serious practice done home row microsoft natural keyboard pro circa home row center row keys on typewriter computer keyboard on most common type english language keyboard qwerty layout s d f j k l are home keys on home row middle row keyboard termed home row because typists are trained keep their fingers on these keys and/or return them after pressing any other key that not on home row some keyboards have small bump on certain keys home row this helps returning fingers home row for touch typing for instance type word poll on qwerty keyboard one would place all one's fingers on home row right hand should be covering j k l with thumb on space bar while left hand covers s d f typist will then use their little finger reach for p key located just above semicolon then return pinky back semicolon key from which originated ring finger located on l key will be moved directly upwards press o key then back finally same ring finger will remain on l key press twice experienced typists can do this at speeds over words per minute but method that they always return their fingers home row when they are not use this provides for quick easy access all keys on keyboard repetitive stress injuries typing regularly can put user at risk for repetitive stress injuries such carpal tunnel syndrome tendinitis proper posture can greatly reduce risk injury other methods kinesis advantage keyboard method taught since 1960s perhaps earlier left little finger used for keys ring finger for middle — left index finger responsible for on right side keyboard index — middle — ring — little — all other keys on right side upper row probably these two methods reflect layout typewriters from early days when some them had no and/or keys there exist special ergonomic keyboards designed for both typing methods keyboard split between keys some specialized high-end computer keyboards are designed for touch typists for example many manufacturers provide blank mechanical keyboards trained touch typist should not mind using blank keyboard this kind keyboard may force hunt peck users type without looking similar braille keyboards used by visually impaired see also dvorak simplified keyboard alternative english keyboard layout optimised for comfort speed colemak new keyboard layout more efficient than dvorak qwerty designed improvement over
