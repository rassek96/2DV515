because high resolution stylus fingernail often used stylus-oriented systems are less suited multi-touch capacitive touchscreens tend be less accurate but more responsive than resistive devices because they require conductive material such finger tip for input they are not common among stylus-oriented devices but are prominent on consumer devices most finger-driven capacitive screens do not currently support pressure input except for iphone 6s later models but some tablets use pressure-sensitive stylus active pen some tablets can recognize individual palms while some professional-grade tablets use pressure-sensitive films such those on graphics tablets some capacitive touch-screens can detect size touched area pressure used features most tablets use capacitive touchscreens with
