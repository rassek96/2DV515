exergaming from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search fitness game exergaming exer-gaming portmanteau exercise gaming gamercising term used for video games that are also form exercise exergaming relies on technology that tracks body movement reaction genre has been credited with upending stereotype gaming sedentary activity promoting active lifestyle research indicates that exergames can produce real improvements fitness exergames are seen evolving from technology changes aimed at making video games more fun contents history o 1980s o 1990s o 2000s o 2010s effectiveness o lab + children + adults o beyond lab o injury design trends references further reading history genre's roots can be found games released late eighties including foot craz which was first such device released for atari power pad family trainer released for nintendo entertainment system nes although both had limited success konami's dance dance revolution was cited one first major successes exergaming when was ported from arcade playstation sold over three million copies 2000s number devices games have used exergame style much success eyetoy camera has sold over ten million units while nintendo's wii fit has sold excess million copies by june health games were generating revenues $2 billion largely due wii fit's million sales at time term exergaming entered collins english dictionary genre has been mooted way improve users' health through exercise but few studies have been undertaken measure health benefits smaller trials have yielded mixed results have shown that respective traditional methods exercise are superior their video game equivalents 1980s exergaming contains elements that were developed virtual reality community during 1980s pioneer this area was autodesk which developed two systems highcycle virtual racquetball highcycle was exercise bike that user would pedal through virtual landscape if user pedaled fast enough virtual bike would take off fly over landscape virtual racquetball tracked position orientation actual racquet that was used hit virtual ball virtual environment this environment was shared with another user equipped with another tracked racquet allowing two users play each other over phone lines both systems users could wear vpl eyephones early head-mounted display hmd that would provide more immersion for user first true attempt at what would later be called exertainment was atari puffer project this was exercise bike that would hook up atari 400/800 system forward speed was controlled by pedaling while steering additional gameplay was handled by handlebar-mounted gamepad machine was nearly ready for production with several games tumbleweeds jungle river cruise when atari declared bankruptcy puffer project was abandoned nintendo also dabbled this space with power pad late 1980s first exergaming system released market was computrainer designed training aid motivational tool computrainer allowed users ride through virtual landscape generated on nes while monitoring data such power output pedaling cadence product had price that was far too high be considered entertainment product but was affordable by dedicated athletes product continues this day where now runs using microsoft windows compatible software with extensive graphic physiological capabilities also released for nes was family trainer which focused on entertainment rather than exercise about same time computrainer concept ii introduced computer attachment for their rowing machine this has become their erow product used for both individual motivation well competition indoor rowing leagues 1990s during 1990s there was surge interest application virtual reality technologies high-end gym equipment life fitness nintendo partnered produce exertainment system precor had lcd-based bike product universal had several crt-based systems netpulse system provided users with ability browse web while exercising fitlinxx introduced system that used sensors attached weight machines order provide automated feedback users most sophisticated these entries was tectrix vr bike developed originally by cybergear inc vr bike allowed users pedal through number virtual environments well engage single multiplayer games was joined later by vr climber vr bike software now distributed alongside trixter bikes three issues combined ensure failure these systems marketplace first they were significantly more expensive than equivalent models that did not have all additional electronics second they were harder maintain were often left broken lastly additional expertise required operate software was often intimidating users who shied away from machines out fear that they would look foolish while trying master machine until nothing significant happened field videogame exercise hardware was still too expensive for average home consumer health clubs were gun-shy about adopting any new technology high-performance game console capabilities improved prices fell manufacturers once more started explore fitness market konami's dance dance revolution was released 2000s uk startup exertris introduced interactive gaming bike commercial fitness market exergaming came mass media attention at consumer electronics show when bill gates showcased exertris interactive gaming bike following year same show hosted pavilion dedicated video game technology that also worked sports exercise equipment gamercize played on playstation release eyetoy kinetic brought first—multi-function—exergame hardware into home market making players physical movements into game's controller saw launch gamercize combining traditional fitness equipment with games consoles minimalist approach allows game play continue only when exercising turning all game titles into potential exergames nintendo's wii brought acceleration detection with wii remote late nintendo released exergame wii fit which utilized new peripheral wii balance board various approaches exergames have been documented compared by videojug information film popularity wii lead being used hospital wiihab rehabilitation programs pcgamerbike appeared at ces where received honoree award differs from other exergaming devices that its pedal motion can be mapped any key on keyboard also has optical encoder which detects forward reverse pedal motion fisher-price smart cycle was another entry field other examples exergaming products include positive gaming idance istep cobalt flux blufit cyber coach neoracer gymkids exercise equipment with interactive technology some wii titles such ea sports active cybex trazer powergrid fitness kilowatt lightspace play floor playmotion yourselffitness expresso fitness s2 iplay cyber exercycle veqtor sport trainer sportwall 2010s kinect represented significant advance how player motion was detected games because player's body became remote mobile phone apps such zombies run ingress pokémon go have been described augmented reality exergames effectiveness lab order better understand exergaming's relationship with physical activity laboratory studies have compared exergames both traditional seated video games other physical activities for example treadmill walking consistent evidence demonstrates exergaming requires more energy has potential raise heart rate comparison traditional seated video games rest overall most exergames are equivalent light-to-moderate activity for both adults children for example electronic arts commissioned study by university wisconsin that found that ea sports active passed fitness guidelines for effective workout put forth by american college sports medicine however while wii has been seen being more physically demanding than sedentary game consoles study published british medical journal found that while playing wii uses significantly more energy than playing sedentary computer games energy used when playing active wii games not high enough intensity contribute towards recommended daily amount exercise children based on systematic review on active video games for youth none games elicited average energy expenditure above met threshold for vigorous energy expenditure when used at intermediate high intensity exergaming can improve fitness children energy expenditure energy expenditure during exergames differs only slightly from other traditional light-to-moderate intensity physical activities most exergames elicit energy expenditures between light moderate intensities although some studies ‘sizeable percentage' players have performed at vigorous activity levels exergames which only require upper body movement typically result energy expenditures equivalent light physical activity while lower whole body movement games provide activity at least moderate intensity several studies have been done see what types exercise gamers get while playing these types games see if children really benefit from activities over all research indicates exergaming has potential increase physical activity which always benefit anytime physical activity improvement over sedentary time on couch heart rate exergames increase heart rate compared resting those which require whole/lower body movement produce greater increase heart rate than those which use only upper body movements different games requiring similar movements for game play do not necessarily have same impact on heart rate for example games played on dance mats have increased heart rates levels similar those moderate even vigorous intensities whereas games played using balance board have produced heart rates less than that brisk walking pace although both require lower body movement has been argued that heart rate not good proxy for energy expenditure for exergames several studies have shown heart rate increase for sedentary video games body composition bmi few exergaming studies have examined actual changes body composition over time instead estimates have been made based on laboratory game play for example has been suggested that if exergaming were take place at similar intensity outside laboratory children would have potential lose kg-6 kg over course year with only 15–30 minutes game play per day psychological outcomes children young people report enjoying wii fit activities more than inactive games treadmill exercise adults evidence adults less abundant than children studies tend have only small number participants which makes difficult generalise findings whole population energy expenditure exergaming provides form light-to-moderate physical activity for adults wii boxing has been shown produce similar energy expenditure self-selected brisk walking pace while wii aerobics results lower energy expenditure general exergames have less effect on energy expenditure than playing actual sport energy expenditure does not increase by adding active elements traditional games for example adding specialist motion sensing controllers play shooting games was no more effective increasing energy expenditure than using traditional hand held controllers heart rate exergamers experience greater increase heart rate after minutes wii fit's free run than treadmill walking at mph while wii boxing produces heart rate similar that self-selected brisk walking pace contrast self-selected brisk treadmill walking results higher heart rate than what obtained by participating wii aerobics tennis baseball psychological outcomes research shows changes psychological wellbeing from taking part exergaming are mixed older women positive changes self-perception social psychological wellbeing have been noted after six weeks game play alternatively measurements wellbeing decreased after single session wii fit free run compared with treadmill walking young adults these young adults did however perceive playing wii fit be more intense than treadmill walking both younger older adults rate exergaming more enjoyable than inactive gaming treadmill walking falls balance older adults healthy older adults there some evidence that dance exergames can improve mental health eg dance don't fall improve measures physical performance such narrow walk time test self-reported balance confidence additionally anecdotal evidence suggests nintendo wii can be used part falls rehabilitation programme studies have demonstrated increases dynamic balance reduction timed up go scores which measures mobility improvements static balance after wii usage however most these studies tend be case studies additionally few exergames have been designed specifically for elderly we lack knowledge about characteristics movements elicited by exergames thereby about their potential train functions important for fall risk reduction moreover exergames provide better user experience if games are developed specifically for older adults more robust evidence needed warrant inclusion exergaming falls prevention programmes upper extremity dysfunction upper extremity dysfunction results from variety different diseases disorders degree dysfunction ranges from subject's self-reported pain weakness impairment shoulder elbow wrist hand larger symptoms such debilitating post-stroke multiple studies have chosen incorporate wii into both movement therapy exercise regimens for patients displaying these symptoms order test whether use wii's motion controller will benefit these patients through kind gaming rehabilitation study done by hsu et al examined effect wii bowling on shoulder motion range elderly long-term care patients with upper extremity debilities supplemented their standard exercise regimen by playing wii sports bowling with affected arm for minutes at least twice week for one month this resulted overall improvement patients' active range shoulder motion well better scores modified paces physical activity enjoyment scale nhppt nursing home physical performance test research has also shown positive effect from wii sports movement therapy for stroke patients stroke patients with upper limb dysfunction underwent movement therapy consisting monitored intense wii sports gaming for two weeks these patients displayed improved functional use their dominantly affected arm hand along with increase joint range motion furthermore significant clinical improvement on test metrics such wmft wolf motor function test mal-qom motor activity log quality movement suggests that skills gained from wii-based movement therapy are transferable daily-living activities beyond lab one primary goal exergaming get children adults off couch more active laboratory studies showing brief increases physical fitness result exergaming may not translate real world improvements systematic review randomised controlled trials before/after studies exergames beyond lab showed that exergames are associated with better outcome bmi/weight with some evidence for improvements vo2 max adherence exercise review called for more research on mechanisms that make exergames effective individual studies vary their findings one study children actual homes over extended period did not show lasting changes their exercise habits this study revealed no evidence that children receiving active video games were more active general at any time than children receiving inactive video games exercise physiologist anthony barnett suggested results study are predictable he said that children compensate for increased activity exergaming by reducing their exercise other parts their lives resulting no net gain when designing interventions that incorporate exergaming guidelines on frequency duration usage should be given participants benefits exercise on mental ability productivity are early stages research but indications from using gamercize with computer have been reported providing 17% productivity improvement combining cardiovascular exercise balance practice has been shown increase academic success among students grades k-12 according active healthy kids canada report card on physicalactivity for children youth children who are physically active perform better school than those who are not interestingly academic performance improves even when academic learning time reduced allow time for physical activity different question whether exergaming effects beliefs about attitudes toward physical activity for example 6-week program incorporated into 5th grade physical education lessons singapore children who were exposed threat-framed messages about physical activity who also played wii exergames developed more positive attitudes higher perceived behavioral control than children who were only exposed messages effectiveness maintaining interest exercise using traditional fitness machines has been examined with gamercize found be six times more sustainable than exercise alone injury see also video game-related health problems after wii was released there were several cases injury related using wii often dubbed wiiitis injuries can be like tennis elbow players were cautioned that even level exercise needed use wii could cause injury design trends when making exergaming system manufacturer consumer product must make decision whether system will be usable with off-the-shelf games if custom software must be written for because takes longer for user move their entire body response stimulation from game often case that dedicated software must be written for game playable example this konami's dance dance revolution though designed be played by users moving about on specially designed dancepad that game can alternatively be played by pushing buttons with one's fingers using standard hand-held gamepad when played with dancepad at higher levels game can be quite challenging physically exhausting but if game played using buttons on hand controller none sequences are physically limited newer systems such xbox playstation wii use alternative input devices such kinect playstation move move uses image analysis extract motion user against background uses these motions control character game specifically designed exercise game kinetic superimposes animated objects be punched kicked otherwise interacted with over video image user wii playstation both incorporate motion sensors such accelerometers gyroscopes into hand-held controllers that are used direct behaviors within game research projects such exertion interfaces that investigate design aspects these games explore how technological augmentation that comes with digital gameplay component can be nurtured for additional benefits such utilizing social power exercising together even though players are connected only over network scaling amount players enabling novel exercise experiences not available without technological augmentation exergame resellers have developed fitness centers specialist room designs with programmes that focus entirely on creating environments for young people using exergaming for fitness group fitness programmer les mills international has recently launched immersive fitness studios around globe which combine exergaming with live group fitness classes one newest trends using
