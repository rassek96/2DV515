computer mice keyboards etc output devices which provide output user from computer monitors printers etc input/output devices that perform both functions touchscreens are example that combines different devices into single hardware component that can be used both input output device peripheral device generally defined any auxiliary device such computer mouse keyboard that connects works with computer some way other examples peripherals are image scanners tape drives microphones loudspeakers webcams digital cameras many modern devices such digital watches smartphones tablet computers have interfaces that allow them be used peripheral by desktop computers although they are not host-dependent same way other peripheral devices common input peripherals include keyboards computer mice
