jpl traces its beginnings guggenheim aeronautical laboratory at california institute technology galcit when first set rocket experiments were carried out arroyo seco caltech graduate students frank malina qian xuesen weld arnold apollo m o smith along with jack parsons edward s forman tested small alcohol-fueled motor gather data for malina's graduate thesis malina's thesis advisor was engineer/aerodynamicist theodore von kármán who eventually arranged for us army financial support for this galcit rocket project malina parsons forman martin summerfield pilot homer bushey demonstrated first jato rockets army von kármán malina parsons forman established aerojet corporation manufacture jato motors project took on name jet propulsion laboratory november formally becoming army facility operated under contract by university during jpl's army years laboratory developed two deployed weapon systems mgm-5 corporal mgm-29 sergeant intermediate range ballistic missiles these missiles were first us ballistic missiles developed at jpl also developed number other weapons system prototypes such loki anti-aircraft missile system forerunner aerobee sounding rocket at various times carried out rocket testing at white sands proving ground edwards air force base goldstone california lunar lander was also developed 1938-39 which influenced design apollo lunar module 1960s jpl teamed up with wernher von braun's rocketeers at army ballistic missile agency's redstone arsenal huntsville alabama propose orbiting satellite during international geophysical year team lost that proposal project vanguard instead embarked on classified project demonstrate ablative re-entry technology using jupiter-c rocket they carried out three successful sub-orbital flights using spare juno i modified jupiter-c with fourth stage two organizations then launched united states' first satellite explorer on february msl mockup compared with mars exploration rover sojourner rover by jet propulsion laboratory on may jpl was transferred nasa december becoming agency's primary planetary spacecraft center jpl engineers designed operated ranger surveyor missions moon that prepared way for apollo jpl also led way interplanetary exploration with mariner missions venus mars mercury jpl opened near-earth object program office for nasa has found 95% asteroids that are kilometer more diameter that cross earth's orbit jpl was early employ women mathematicians 1940s 1950s using mechanical calculators women all-female computations group performed trajectory calculations jpl hired dana ulery their first woman engineer work alongside male engineers part ranger mariner mission tracking teams jpl has been recognized four times by space foundation with douglas s morrow public outreach award which given annually individual organization that has made significant contributions public awareness space programs with john l jack swigert jr award for space exploration on three occasions – part nasa's phoenix mars lander team location research rockets on display at jpl when founded jpl's site was rocky flood-plain just outside city limits pasadena almost all acres ha us federal government/nasa owned property that makes up jpl campus today located city la cañada flintridge california on northwest border pasadena with pasadena address oak grove drive pasadena ca which also official mailing address city la cañada flintridge california was incorporated well after jpl attained international recognition with pasadena address there has been occasional conflict between two cities over issue which should be mentioned media home laboratory employees 1960s advert reads when you were kid science fiction gave you sense wonder now you feel same just by going work there are approximately full-time caltech employees typically few thousand additional contractors working on any given day nasa also has resident office at facility staffed by federal managers who oversee jpl's activities work for nasa there are also some caltech graduate students college student interns co-op students education jpl education office serves educators students by providing them with activities resources materials opportunities tied nasa missions science mission its programs introduce further students' interest pursuing stem science technology engineering mathematics careers internships fellowships jpl offers research internship fellowship opportunities summer throughout year high school through postdoctoral faculty students most cases students must be us citizens legal permanent residents apply although foreign nationals studying at us universities are eligible for limited programs interns are sponsored through nasa programs university partnerships jpl mentors for research opportunities at laboratory areas including technology robotics planetary science aerospace engineering astrophysics august jpl was named one most awesome college labs by popular science which noted that about students who intern at laboratory are considered for permanent jobs at jpl after they graduate jpl education office also hosts planetary science summer school psss annual week-long workshop for graduate postdoctoral students program involves one-week team design exercise developing early mission concept study working with jpl's advanced projects design team team x other concurrent engineering teams museum alliance jpl created nasa museum alliance out desire provide museums planetariums visitor centers other kinds informal educators with exhibit materials professional development information related upcoming landing mars rovers spirit opportunity alliance now has more than members who get access nasa displays models educational workshops networking opportunities through program staff at educational organizations that meet museum alliance requirements can register participate online museum alliance subset jpl education office's informal education group which also serves after-school summer programs parents other kinds informal educators educator resource center nasa/jpl educator resource center which moving from its location at indian hill mall pomona calif at end offers resources materials free workshops for formal informal educators covering science technology engineering science topics related nasa missions science open house display at open house on may lab has open house once year on saturday sunday may june when public invited tour facilities see live demonstrations jpl science technology more limited private tours are also available throughout year if scheduled well advance thousands schoolchildren from southern california elsewhere visit lab every year due federal spending cuts mandated by budget sequestration open house has been previously cancelled jpl open house for was october was october starting from jpl replaced annual open house with ticket explore jpl which features same exhibits but requires tickets advance reservation other works addition its government work jpl has also assisted nearby motion picture television industries by advising them about scientific accuracy their productions science fiction shows advised by jpl include babylon its sequel series crusade jpl also works with department homeland security science technology directorate dhsstd jpl dhsstd developed search rescue tool

controversies employee background check lawsuit main article nasa v nelson on february homeland security presidential directive was approved by secretary commerce this was followed by federal information processing standards fips which specified how federal government should implement personal identity verification new specifications led need for rebadging meet updated requirements on august group jpl employees filed suit federal court against nasa caltech department commerce claiming their constitutional rights were being violated by new overly invasive background investigations 97% jpl employees were classified at low-risk level would be subjected same clearance procedures those obtaining moderate/high risk clearance under hspd12 fips investigators have right obtain any information on employees which includes questioning acquaintances on status employee's mental emotional financial stability additionally if employees depart jpl before end two-year validity background check no investigation ability gets terminated former employees can still be legally monitored employees were told that if they did not sign unlimited waiver privacy they would be deemed have voluntarily resigned rebadging rules were designed make jpl compliant with fips united states court appeals for ninth circuit found process violated employees' privacy rights has issued preliminary injunction nasa appealed us supreme court granted certiorari on march on january supreme court overturned ninth circuit decision ruling that background checks did not violate any constitutional privacy right that employees may have had coppedge v jet propulsion laboratory on march los angeles superior court took opening statements on case which former-jpl employee david coppedge brought suit against lab due workplace discrimination wrongful termination suit coppedge alleges that he first lost his team lead status on jpl's cassini-huygens mission then was fired because his evangelical christian beliefs specifically his belief intelligent design conversely jpl through caltech lawyers representing laboratory allege that coppedge's termination was simply due budget cuts his demotion from team lead was because harassment complaints from on-going conflicts with his co-workers superior court judge ernest hiroshige issued final ruling favor jpl on january see also jet propulsion
