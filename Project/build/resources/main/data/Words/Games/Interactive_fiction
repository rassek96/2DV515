users term distinguish between interactive fiction known puzzle-free that focuses on narrative text adventures that focus on puzzles commercial product interactive fiction reached its peak popularity from dominant software product marketed for home computers due their text-only nature they sidestepped problem writing for widely divergent graphics architectures this meant that interactive fiction

adventure genre player uses text input control game game state relayed player via text output input usually provided by player form simple sentences such get key go east which are interpreted by text parser parsers may vary sophistication first text adventure parsers could only handle two-word sentences form verb-noun pairs later parsers such those built on infocom's zil zork implementation language could understand complete sentences later parsers could handle increasing levels complexity parsing sentences such open red box with green key then go north this level complexity standard for works interactive fiction today despite their lack graphics text adventures include physical dimension where players move between rooms many text adventure games boasted their total number rooms indicate how much gameplay they offered these games are unique that they may create illogical space where going north from area takes you area b but going south from area b did not take you back area this can create mazes that do not behave players expect thus players must maintain their own map these illogical spaces are much more rare today's era gaming interactive fiction community general decries use mazes entirely claiming that mazes have become arbitrary 'puzzles for sake puzzles' that they can hands inexperienced designers become immensely frustrating for players navigate interactive fiction shares much common with multi-user dungeons 'muds' muds which became popular mid-1980s rely on textual exchange accept similar commands from players do works if however since interactive fiction single player muds by definition have multiple players they differ enormously gameplay styles muds often focus gameplay on activities that involve communities players simulated political systems in-game trading other gameplay mechanics that aren't possible single player environment interactive fiction usually relies on reading from screen on typing input although

player directly newer games tend have specific well-defined protagonists with separate identities from player classic essay crimes against mimesis discusses among other if issues nature you interactive fiction typical response might look something like this response look tea chest at start curses that was first place you tried hours hours ago now there's nothing there but that boring old book you pick up anyway bored you are many text adventures particularly those designed for humour such zork hitchhiker's guide galaxy leather goddesses phobos address player with informal tone sometimes including sarcastic remarks see transcript from curses above for example late douglas adams designing if version his 'hitchhiker's guide galaxy' created unique solution final puzzle game game requires one solitary item that player didn't choose at outset play some if works dispense with second-person narrative entirely opting for first-person perspective 'i' even placing player position observer rather than direct participant some 'experimental' if concept self-identification eliminated entirely player instead takes role inanimate object force nature abstract concept experimental if usually pushes limits concept challenges many assumptions about medium history during 1960s 1970s natural language processing though neither program was developed narrative work software programs eliza 1964–1966 shrdlu 1968–1970 can formally be considered early examples interactive fiction both programs used natural language processing take input from their user respond virtual conversational manner eliza simulated psychotherapist that appeared provide human-like responses user's input while shrdlu employed artificial intelligence that could move virtual objects around environment respond questions asked about environment's shape development effective natural language processing would become essential part interactive fiction development adventure around will crowther programmer amateur caver wrote first text adventure game adventure originally called advent because filename could only be six characters long operating system he was using later named colossal cave adventure having just gone through divorce he was looking for way connect with his two young children over course few weekends he wrote text based cave exploration game that featured sort guide/narrator who talked full sentences who understood simple two word commands that came close natural english adventure was programmed fortran for pdp-10 crowther's original version was accurate simulation part real colossal cave but also included fantasy elements such axe-wielding dwarves magic bridge stanford university graduate student don woods discovered adventure while working at stanford artificial intelligence laboratory obtained expanded crowther's source code with crowther's permission woods's changes were reminiscent writings jrr tolkien included troll elves volcano some claim based on mount doom but woods says was not early adventure spread across arpanet has survived on internet this day game has since been ported many other operating systems was included with floppy-disk distribution microsoft's ms-dos os adventure cornerstone online if community there currently exist dozens different independently-programmed versions with additional elements such new rooms puzzles various scoring systems popularity adventure led wide success interactive fiction during late 1970s when home computers had little if any graphics capability many elements original game have survived into present such command 'xyzzy' which now included easter egg modern games such microsoft minesweeper adventure was also directly responsible for founding sierra online later sierra entertainment ken roberta williams played game decided design one their own but with graphics commercial era adventure international was founded by scott adams not be confused with creator dilbert adams wrote adventureland which was loosely patterned after original colossal cave adventure he took out small ad computer magazine order promote sell adventureland thus creating first commercial adventure game he founded adventure international first commercial publisher interactive fiction that same year dog star adventure was published source code form softside spawning legions similar games basic largest company producing works interactive fiction was infocom which created zork series many other titles among them trinity hitchhiker's guide galaxy mind forever voyaging june marc blank bruce k daniels tim anderson dave lebling began writing mainframe version zork also known dungeon at mit laboratory for computer science game was programmed computer language called mdl variant lisp term implementer was self-given name creators text adventure series zork called themselves implementers for this reason that game designers programmers can be referred implementer video games often shortened imp rather than writer early game was completed ten members mit dynamics modelling group went on join infocom when was incorporated later that year order make its games portable possible infocom developed z-machine custom virtual machine which could be implemented on large number platforms which took standardized story files input non-technical sense infocom was responsible for developing interactive style that would be emulated by many later interpreters infocom parser was widely regarded best its era accepted complex complete sentence commands like put blue book on writing desk at time when most its competitors parsers were restricted simple two word verb-noun combinations such put book parser was actively upgraded with new features like undo error correction later games would 'understand' multiple sentence input 'pick up gem put my bag take newspaper clipping out my bag then burn with book matches' several companies offered optional commercial feelies physical props associated with game tradition 'feelies' term itself believed have originated with deadline third infocom title after zork i ii when writing this game was not possible include all information limited 80kb disk space so infocom created first feelies for this game extra items that gave more information than could be included within digital game itself these included police interviews coroner's findings letters crime scene evidence photo murder scene these materials were very difficult for others copy otherwise reproduce many included information which was essential completing game seeing potential benefits both aiding game-play immersion providing measure creative copy-protection addition acting deterrent software piracy infocom later other companies began creating feelies for numerous titles infocom released special version first three zork titles together with plot-specific coins other trinkets this concept would see expansion time went on such that

interactive fiction was mainly written with c-like languages such tads inform number systems for writing interactive fiction now exist most popular remain inform tads adrift but should be noted that they diverged their approach if-writing during 2000s giving today's if writers objective choice by ifcomp most games were written for inform with strong minority games for tads adrift followed by small number games for other systems while familiarity with programming language leads many new authors attempt produce their own complete if application most established if authors recommend use specialised if language arguing that such systems allow authors avoid technicalities producing full featured parser while allowing broad community support choice authoring system usually depends on author's desired balance ease use versus power portability final product other development systems include hugo jacl adventure creation language twine gilsoft's quill professional adventure writer
