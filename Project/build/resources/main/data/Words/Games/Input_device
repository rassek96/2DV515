input device from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search play media common computer input device keyboard user presses key which transfers information computer computing input device peripheral piece computer hardware equipment used provide data control signals information processing system such computer information appliance examples input devices include keyboards mouse scanners digital cameras joysticks many input devices can be classified according modality input eg mechanical motion audio visual etc whether input discrete eg pressing key continuous eg mouse's position though digitized into discrete quantity fast enough be considered continuous number degrees freedom involved eg two-dimensional traditional mice three-dimensional navigators designed for cad applications pointing devices which are input devices used specify position space can further be classified according whether input direct indirect with direct input input space coincides with display space ie pointing done space where visual feedback pointer appears touchscreens light pens involve direct input examples involving indirect input include mouse trackball whether positional information absolute eg on touch screen relative eg with mouse that can be lifted repositioned direct input almost necessarily absolute but indirect input may be either absolute relative for example digitizing graphics tablets that do not have embedded screen involve indirect input sense absolute positions are often run absolute input mode but they may also be set up simulate relative input mode like that touchpad where stylus puck can be lifted repositioned contents keyboards pointing device high-degree freedom input devices composite devices video input devices audio input devices punched card devices punched tape devices other see also further reading keyboards main article computer keyboard 'keyboard' human interface device which represented layout buttons each button key can be used either input linguistic character computer call upon particular function computer they act main text entry interface for most users traditional keyboards use spring-based buttons though newer variations employ virtual keys even projected keyboards typewriter like device composed matrix switches examples types keyboards include keyer keyboard lighted program function keyboard lpfk pointing device computer mouse main article pointing device pointing devices are most commonly used input devices today pointing device any human interface device that allows user input spatial data computer case mouse touchpads this usually achieved by detecting movement across physical surface analog devices such mice joysticks pointing sticks function by reporting their angle deflection movements pointing device are echoed on screen by movements pointer creating simple intuitive way navigate computer's graphical user interface gui examples types pointing devices include mouse touchpad pointing stick touchscreen trackball high-degree freedom input devices some devices allow many continuous degrees freedom input these can be used pointing devices but are generally used ways that don't involve pointing location space such control camera angle while applications these kinds devices are typically used virtual reality systems caves where input that registers six degrees freedom required composite devices wii remote with attached strap input devices such buttons joysticks can be combined on single physical device that could be thought composite device many gaming devices have controllers like this technically mice are composite devices they both track movement provide buttons for clicking but composite devices are generally considered have more than two different forms input examples types composite devices include joystick controller gamepad joypad paddle game controller jog dial/shuttle knob wii remote video input devices microsoft kinect sensor seen here on tv works by detecting human motion visually video input devices are used digitize images video from outside world into computer information can be stored multitude formats depending on user's requirement examples types video input devices include digital camera digital camcorder portable media player webcam microsoft kinect sensor image scanner fingerprint scanner barcode reader scanner laser rangefinder eye gaze tracker examples medical video input devices include computed tomography magnetic resonance imaging positron emission tomography medical ultrasonography audio input devices audio input devices are used capture sound some cases audio output device can be used input device order capture produced soundaudio input devices allow user send audio signals computer for processing recording carrying out commands devices such microphones allow users speak computer order record voice message navigate softwareaside from recording audio input devices are also used with speech recognition software examples types audio input devices include microphones midi keyboard other digital musical instrument punched card devices see punched card input/output punched tape devices see punched tape other digital pen magnetic ink character recognition sip-and-puffcomputer input device see also peripheral display device output device further reading n p milner review human performance
