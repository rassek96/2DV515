effectively than does potential man's seemingly witless destruction earth's resources weiler concludes richard fleischer's direction stresses action not nuances meaning characterization mr robinson pitiably natural realistic sensitive oldster facing futility living dying surroundings but mr heston simply rough cop chasing standard bad guys their 21st-century new york occasionally frightening but
