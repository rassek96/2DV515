models textures levels story lines music money armor life game modes they can be single-player multiplayer mods that add new content underlying game are often called partial conversions while mods that create entirely new game are called total conversions mods that fix bugs only are called unofficial patches games running on personal computer are often designed with change mind allowing modern pc games be modified by gamers without much difficulty these mods can add extra replay value interest internet provides inexpensive medium promote distribute user created content like mods aspect

they are referring unmodified game when talking about playing game term vanilla often used make this distinction vanilla battlefield for example refers original unmodified game for vanilla games

reading types total conversion for fictional energy source see total conversion energy source total conversion mod existing game that replaces virtually all artistic assets original game sometimes core aspects gameplay total conversions can result completely different genre from original often developers intend sell their total conversion stand-alone product which necessitates need replace any remaining original assets avoid copyright infringement since most total conversions only share engine common with original game if engine becomes free software freeware total conversion can be playable without having own original game counter-strike one most popular online games ever made was originally half-life total conversion was so popular that numerous official unofficial counter-strike re-releases have been developed throughout years many mods for half-life such earth's special forces fighting genre football championship sports genre are capable changing gameplay while utilizing modified engine total overhaul see also video game remake total overhaul mod changes redefines gameplay style original game while keeping original game's universe this may include upgrading graphics adding new models dialog music original while still respecting plot changing pace how game played total overhauls are usually combined with significant add-on material well prominent example black mesa which remakes original half-life valve corporation's source game engine fallout project brazil for bethesda softworks obsidian entertainment 's fallout new vegas however some overhauls also change universe background itself very extreme ways point where no longer constitutes original such obscurum - pandemic also released for fallout new vegas this mod derails into alternative history on its own similar original fallout storyline add-on add-on addon typically small mod which adds original content specific game most cases add-on will add one particular element game such new weapon shooting game new vehicle track racing game items game like minecraft this can be accomplished without changing any original game's existing content many games are flexible allow this however that not always case some add-ons occasionally have replace in-game content due nature peculiar game engine may be case for example that game which does not give player option choose their character modders wishing add another player model will simply have overwrite old one famous example this type mod can be found for grand theft auto series wherein modders may use downloadable tools replace content such models game's directory left dead series can also be modded with individual add-ons which are stored vpk format so that player may choose activate given mod not unofficial patch unofficial patch can be mod existing game that fixes bugs not fixed by official patch that unlocks content present released game's files but inaccessible official gameplay such patches are usually created by members game's fan base when original developer unwilling unable supply functionality officially jazz jackrabbit has unofficial patch which adds fixes many its features one downside this type mod that leaked content can be revealed example hot coffee mod for grand theft auto san andreas which was removed version because lawsuits by parent associations hot coffee was brought back version by group modders who found animation files scripts first version game scripts were re-added animations were re-hexed so game would not have any conflict art mod art mod mod that created for artistic effect art mods are most frequently associated with video game art however modified games that retain their playability are subject more extensive mods ie closer total conversions may also be classified art games art mods are usually designed subvert original game experience one example velvet-strike mod for counter strike which players spray-paint anti-violence messages multiplayer games form performance art another example robert nideffer's tomb raider i ii patches which were designed subvert unofficial nude raider patch late 1990s by altering lara croft's sexual orientation origins art mod can be traced classic mod castle smurfenstein humorous subversion castle wolfenstein which replaces nazi guards with smurfs very first art mod however generally considered be iimura takahiko's aiueounn six features modification sony's system g support continuation by mod after ea lost license ended support for mvp baseball game's modding community continues support releases updated roster lists every year also alternative leagues eg mvp caribe total conversion official status mods due increasing popularity quality modding some developers such firaxis have included fan-made mods official releases expansion packs similar case that valve corporation when they hired defense ancients author icefrog developing dota for example civilization iv expansion beyond sword two existing mods rhye's fall civilization fall from heaven made their way into expansion latter through spin-off called age ice number fan-made maps scenarios mods such double your pleasure were also included civilization iii expansion play world development most mods do not progress very far are abandoned without ever having public release some are very limited just include some gameplay changes even different loading screen others are total conversions can modify content gameplay extensively few mods become very popular convert themselves into distinct games with rights getting bought turning into official modification group mod developers may join together form mod team mods are made for many first-person shooters real-time-strategies such series based on quake doom chaos total annihilation rise nations command conquer most well-known mod half-life multiplayer mod counter-strike which was released shortly after original game approximately one million games are hosted on dedicated servers per day counter-strike probably best example modification that turns into retail game another renowned mod team fortress which was based on quake engine eventually became whole series games team fortress classic team fortress unofficial mod made originally fan-made sequel tfc fortress forever tools mod-making tools are variety construction sets for creating mods for game early commercial mod-making tools were boulder dash construction kit bard's tale construction set which allowed users create game designs those series much more successful among early mod-making tools was forgotten realms unlimited adventures from strategic simulations inc which allowed users construct games based on game world that was launched with pool radiance game later mod-making tools include elder scrolls construction set which shipped with morrowind world editor for warcraft iii reign chaos aurora toolset which was included with neverwinter nights fred fred2 mission editors for freespace freespace respectively obsidian tool set for neverwinter nights garden eden creation kit sdk for fallout valve hammer editor which used create maps for half-life half-life various other games based on source engine older versions also supported quake engine there are also free content delivery tools available that make playing mods easier they help manage downloads updates mod installation order allow people who are less technically literate play steam for half-life mods example game support for modifications potential for end-user change game varies greatly though can have little correlation on number quality mods made for game general most modification-friendly games will define gameplay variables text other non proprietary format files for instance civilization series one could alter movement rate along roads many other factors have graphics standard format such bitmaps publishers can also determine mod-friendliness way important source files are available some programs collect their source material into large proprietary archives but others make files available folders games have varying support from their publishers for modifications but often require expensive professional software make one such example homeworld which requires program maya build new in-game objects however there free version available maya other advanced modeling software there are also free even open-source modeling programs such blender that can be used well for advanced mods such desert combat that are total conversions complicated modeling texturing software required make original content advanced mods can rival complexity work making original game content short engine itself rendering differences ease modding small comparison total amount work required having engine that for example easy import models little help when doing research modeling making photorealistic texture for game item result other game characteristics such its popularity capabilities have dominating effect on number mods created for game by users game that allows modding said be moddable elder scrolls v skyrim well its predecessors elder scrolls iii morrowind elder scrolls iv oblivion are examples highly moddable games with official editor available for download from developer daggerfall was much less moddable but some people released their own modifications nevertheless some modifications such gunslingers academy have deliberately made game more moddable by adding scripting support externalizing underlying code example widely seen mod elder scrolls v skyrim by videogame designer by name pastaspace exceeded million views on december youtube video mod involved switching out character terrifying dragon with what many commentators referred equally terrifying if humorous character thomas tank engine supreme commander set out be 'most customisable game ever' such included mod manager which allowed for modular modding having several mods on at once games industry currently facing question how much should embrace players' contribution creating new material for game mod-communities part their structure within game some software companies openly accept even encourage such communities others though have chosen enclose their games heavily policed copyright intellectual property regimesipr close down sites that they see infringing their ownership game portability issues for cross-platform games mods written for windows version have not always been compatible with mac os x and/or linux ports game large part this due publisher's concern with prioritizing porting primary game itself when allocating resources for fixing porting mod-specific functions may not be cost-effective for smaller market share alternate platforms for example battlefield ported by aspyr for mac os x had file access issues specific mods until patch unreal tournament does not have working community mods menu for mac os x version until patch had graphics incompatibilities with several mods such red orchestra metaball also mods compiled into platform-specific libraries such those doom are often only built for windows platform leading lack cross-platform compatibility even when underlying game highly portable same line reasoning mod development tools are often available only on windows platform id software's doom radiant tool epic games' unrealed are examples this mod teams that lack either resources know-how develop their mods for alternate platforms sometimes outsource their code art assets individuals groups who are able port mod mod specialist site for macs macologist has created gui launchers installers for many ut2004 mods well solving cross-platform conversion issues for mods for other games unforeseen

that this will be win for authors gamers but we are always going be data driven feature was implemented with idea that there would be oversight from valve third-party developer this led overpriced content mods being improperly sold by user that had not created original mod copyright issues with content such mods after large influx complaints valve announced they would discontinue paid mods for skyrim refund those that spent money on workshop re-evaluate process removal system itself was also criticized see also adventure construction set one earliest games for which user-created content was
