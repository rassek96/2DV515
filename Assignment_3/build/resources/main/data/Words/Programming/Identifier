object unique class objects where object class may be idea physical object class thereof physical substance class thereof abbreviation id often refers identity identification process identifying identifier that instance identification identifier may be word number letter symbol any combination those words numbers letters symbols may follow encoding system wherein letters digits words symbols stand for represent ideas longer names they may simply be arbitrary when identifier follows encoding system often referred code id code identifiers that do not follow any encoding scheme are often said be arbitrary ids they are arbitrarily assigned have no greater meaning sometimes identifiers are called codes even when they are actually arbitrary whether because speaker believes that they have deeper meaning simply because he speaking casually imprecisely id codes inherently carry metadata along with them for example when you know that food package front you has identifier t1542z-mfr5-p02-243-45 you not only have that data you also have metadata that tells you that was packaged on september at 342pm utc manufactured by licensed vendor number at peoria il usa plant building was 243rd package off line that shift was inspected by inspector number arbitrary identifiers carry no metadata for example if your food package just says its id may not tell you anything except identity—no date manufacturer name production sequence rank inspector number some cases even arbitrary identifiers such sequential serial numbers leak too much information see german tank problem opaque identifiers—identifiers designed avoid leaking even that small amount information—include really opaque pointers version uuids unique identifier uid identifier that refers only one instance—only one particular object universe part number identifier but not unique identifier—for that serial number needed identify each instance part design thus identifier model t identifies class model automobiles that ford's model t comprises whereas unique identifier model t serial number identifies one specific member that class—that one particular model t car owned by one specific person concepts name identifier are denotatively equal terms are thus denotatively synonymous but they are not always connotatively synonymous because code names id numbers are often connotatively distinguished from names sense traditional natural language naming for example both jamie zawinski netscape employee number are identifiers for same specific human being but normal english-language connotation may consider jamie zawinski name not identifier whereas considers netscape employee number identifier but not name this emic indistinction rather than etic one contents metadata computer science o computer languages ambiguity o identifiers ids versus unique identifiers uids o implicit context namespace conflicts identifiers various disciplines see also references metadata metadata identifier language-independent label sign token that uniquely identifies object within identification scheme suffix identifier also used representation term when naming data element computer science computer science identifiers ids are lexical tokens that name entities identifiers are used extensively virtually all information processing systems identifying entities makes possible refer them which essential for any kind symbolic processing computer languages computer languages identifiers are tokens also called symbols which name language entities some kinds entities identifier might denote include variables types labels subroutines packages which character sequences constitute identifiers depends on lexical grammar language common rule alphanumeric sequences with underscore also allowed with condition that not begin with digit simplify lexing by avoiding confusing with integer literals – so foo foo1 foobar foo are allowed but 1foo not – this definition used earlier versions c c++ python many other languages later versions these languages along with many other modern languages support almost all unicode characters identifier however common restriction not permit whitespace characters language operators this simplifies tokenization by making free-form context-free for example forbidding + identifiers due its use binary operation means that a+b + b can be tokenized same while if were allowed a+b would be identifier not addition whitespace identifier particularly problematic if spaces are allowed identifiers then clause such if rainy day then legal with rainy day identifier but tokenizing this requires phrasal context being condition if clause some languages do allow spaces identifiers however such algol some algol variants – for example following valid statement real half pi which could be entered real half pi keywords are represented boldface concretely via stropping algol this was possible because keywords are syntactically differentiated so there no risk collision ambiguity spaces are eliminated during line reconstruction phase source was processed via scannerless parsing so lexing could be context-sensitive most languages some character sequences have lexical form identifier but are known keywords – for example if frequently keyword for if clause but lexically same form ig foo namely sequence letters this overlap can be handled various ways these may be forbidden from being identifiers – which simplifies tokenization parsing – which case they are reserved words they may both be allowed but distinguished other ways such via stropping keyword sequences may be allowed identifiers which sense determined from context which requires context-sensitive lexer non-keywords may also be reserved words forbidden identifiers particularly for forward compatibility case word may become keyword future few languages eg pl/1 distinction not clear scope accessibility within program identifier can be either local global global identifier declared outside functions available throughout program local identifier declared within specific function only available within that function for implementations programming languages that are using compiler identifiers are often only compile time entities that at runtime compiled program contains references memory addresses offsets rather than textual identifier tokens these memory addresses offsets having been assigned by compiler each identifier languages that support reflection such interactive evaluation source code using interpreter incremental compiler identifiers are also runtime entities sometimes even first-class objects that can be freely manipulated evaluated lisp these are called symbols compilers interpreters do not usually assign any semantic meaning identifier based on actual character sequence used however there are exceptions for example perl variable indicated using prefix called sigil which specifies aspects how variable interpreted expressions ruby variable automatically considered immutable if its identifier starts with capital letter fortran first letter variable's name indicates whether by default created integer floating point variable go capitalization first letter variable's name determines its visibility uppercase for public lowercase for private some languages such go identifiers uniqueness based on their spelling their visibility html identifier one possible attributes html element unique within document ambiguity identifiers ids versus unique identifiers uids main article unique identifier many resources may carry multiple identifiers typical examples are one person with multiple names nicknames forms address titles salutations o for example one specific person may be identified by all following identifiers jane smith jane elizabeth meredith smith jane e m smith jane e smith janie smith janie little janie opposed her mother sister cousin big janie aunt jane auntie janie mom grandmom nana kelly's mother billy's grandmother ms smith dr smith jane e smith phd fuzzy her jocular nickname at work one document with multiple versions one substance with multiple names for example cas index names versus iupac names inn generic drug names versus usan generic drug names versus brand names inverse also possible where multiple resources are represented with same identifier discussed below implicit context namespace conflicts see also naming collision many codes nomenclatural systems originate within small namespace over years some them bleed into larger namespaces people interact ways they formerly hadn't eg cross-border trade scientific collaboration military alliance general cultural interconnection assimilation when such dissemination happens limitations original naming convention which had formerly been latent moot become painfully apparent often necessitating retronymy synonymity translation/ transcoding so on such limitations generally accompany shift away from original context broader one typically system shows implicit context context was formerly assumed narrow lack capacity eg low number possible ids reflecting outmoded narrow context lack extensibility no features defined reserved against future needs lack specificity disambiguating capability related context shift where longstanding uniqueness encounters novel nonuniqueness within computer science this problem called naming collision story origination expansion coden system provides good case example recent-decades technical-nomenclature context capitalization variations seen with specific designators reveals instance this problem occurring natural languages where proper noun/common noun distinction its complications must be dealt with universe which every object had uid would not need any namespaces which say that would constitute one gigantic namespace but human minds could never keep track semantically interrelate so many uids identifiers various disciplines small sample various identifiers identifier scope
