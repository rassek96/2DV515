vbscript from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search vbscript developer microsoft first appeared years ago stable release os windows filename extensions vbs vbe wsf wsc hta htm html asp website msdnmicrosoftcom/en-us/library/t0aew7h6aspx major implementations windows script host active server pages influenced by visual basic influenced windows powershell vbscript microsoft visual basic scripting edition active scripting language developed by microsoft that modeled on visual basic allows microsoft windows system administrators generate powerful tools for managing computers with error handling subroutines other advanced programming constructs can give you complete control over many aspects your computing environment vbscript uses component object model access elements environment within which running for example filesystemobject fso used create read update delete files vbscript has been installed by default every desktop release microsoft windows since windows windows server since windows nt option pack optionally with windows ce depending on device installed on vbscript script must be executed within host environment which there are several provided with microsoft windows including windows script host wsh internet explorer ie internet information services iis additionally vbscript hosting environment embeddable other programs through technologies such microsoft script control msscriptocx contents history environments functionality o language features o vbscript functionalities o additional functionality development tools examples o hello world o make your computer talk o terminate task o creating ten files with unique names o sendkeys o windows file operations o vbscript's assistant o send email uses see also references external links history vbscript began part microsoft windows script technologies launched this technology which also included jscript was initially targeted at web developers during period just over two years vbscript advanced from version over that time gained support from windows system administrators seeking automation tool more powerful than batch language first developed early 1980s on march alan cooper showed bill gates his shell prototype that allowed widgets be added dynamically on march microsoft adopted quick basic this allowed users create windows apps quickly easily with gui finally on august internet explorer was made with features that included vbscript version functionality vbscript was increased with new features including regular expressions classes with statement eval execute executeglobal functions evaluate execute script commands built during execution another script function-pointer system via getref distributed com dcom support version submatches were added regular expression class vbscript finally allow script authors capture text within expression's groups that capability had already been available jscript with advent net framework scripting team took decision implement future support for vbscript within aspnet for web development therefore no new versions vbscript engine would be developed would henceforth be supported by microsoft's sustaining engineering team who are responsible for bug fixes security enhancements for windows system administrators microsoft suggests migrating windows powershell however scripting engine will continue be shipped with future releases microsoft windows iis environments when employed for client-side web development microsoft internet explorer vbscript similar function javascript used write executable functions that are embedded included from html pages interact with document object model dom page perform tasks not possible html alone however other web browsers such firefox opera do not have built-in support for vbscript this means that where client-side scripting cross-browser compatibility are required developers usually choose javascript over vbscript vbscript also used for server-side processing web pages most notably with microsoft active server pages asp asp engine type library aspdll invokes vbscriptdll run vbscript scripts vbscript that embedded asp page contained within context switches following example asp page with vbscript displays current time 24-hour format but also used default script for error messages with windows operating systems vbscript example time 24-hour format vbscript can also be used create applications that run directly on workstation running microsoft windows simplest example script that makes use windows script host wsh environment such script usually stand-alone file with file extension vbs script can be invoked two ways wscriptexe used display output receive input through gui such dialog input boxes cscriptexe used command line environment vbscript can be included two other types scripting files windows script files html applications windows script file wsf styled after xml wsf file can include multiple vbs files result wsf files provide means for code reuse library classes functions can be stored one more vbs files which can be included wsf files so functionality can be reused modular way files have extension wsf can be executed using wscriptexe cscriptexe just vbs file can html application hta styled after html html file used generate user interface scripting language such vbscript used for program logic files have extension hta can be executed using mshtaexe vbscript jscript can also be used windows script component activex-enabled script class that can be invoked by other com-enabled applications these files have extension wsc vbscript simple create can be coded using easy use text editor like notepad simple vbscript saved by vbs extension can be run on windows system by double clicking functionality language features language vbscript modeled on visual basic therefore can be reviewed using similar categories procedures control structures constants variables user interaction array handling date/time functions error handling mathematical functions objects regular expressions string manipulation so on following are some key points introduction vbscript language procedure main construct vbscript for separating code into smaller modules vbscript distinguishes between function which can return result assignment statement subroutine which cannot parameters are positional can be passed by value by reference control structures include usual iterative conditional do loops if-then-else statements case statements with some more complex variants such elseif nested control structures memory aid coding certainly for readability there are large number constants such true false for logical values vbokcancel vbyesno for msgbox codes vbblack vbyellow for color values vbcr for carriage return character many others variables have variant type by default but possible sometimes necessary force particular type integer date etc using conversion functions cint cdate etc user interaction provided through functions msgbox inputbox which provide simple dialogue box format for messages input both functions display prompting messages with former returning standard response latter returning one user-supplied text numeric value for more elaborate gui interaction with controls vbscript can be used combination with html for example html application event-driven forms are not supported visual basic visual basic for applications names are not case-sensitive however considered best practice vbscript style be consistent capitalize judiciously vbscript functionalities when hosted by windows script host vbscript provides numerous features which are common scripting languages but not available from visual basic these features include direct easy access named unnamed command line arguments stdin stdout which could be redirected wshecho which writes console cannot be redirected wshexitcode which can be tested from dos batch files by process which invoked script file network printers network shares special folders eg desktop favorites mydocuments so on network user information such group membership methods for runtime execution text defined at runtime eval execute methods for executing scripts on remote machines windows management instrumentation wmi functionality for embedding vbscript engine other applications using widely known language cscript command line runner provides options for interactive batch mode invoking debug mode from command line error reporting including line number additional functionality file system management file modification streaming text operations are implemented with scripting runtime library scrrundll this provides objects such filesystemobject file textstream which expose windows file system programmer binary file memory i/o are provided by adodbstream class which can also be used for string builders avoid excessive string concatenation which can be costly interconvert byte arrays strings database access made possible through activex data objects ado iis metabase can be manipulated using getobject function with sufficient permissions useful for creating destroying sites virtual directories xml files schemas can be manipulated with microsoft xml library application programming interfaces msxml6dll msxml3dll which also can be used retrieve content from world wide web via xmlhttp serverxmlhttp objects class strings msxml2xmlhttp60 msxml2serverxmlhttp60 respectively functionality can also be added through activex technologies security concerns have led many activex controls being blacklisted internet explorer process by microsoft which deploys killbit via monthly windows security updates disable vulnerable microsoft third party code development tools microsoft does not routinely make available ide integrated development environment for vbscript although microsoft script editor has been bundled with certain versions microsoft office for debugging purposes microsoft script debugger can still be used current windows versions even though tool has not been updated years allows user set break points vbscript code but user interface more than clumsy there are vbscript debuggers available from third-party sources many text editors offer syntax highlighting for language during execution when error occurs script host issues message stating type error number offending line examples hello world simplest way output hello world msgbox hello world 'if visual basic version higher than you can also write like this msgboxhello world this would be saved vbs file vbe executed using cscriptexe wscriptexe more elaborate example showing use msgbox function returning result use three parameters including use constants second parameter dim x ' these three produce same result however use constants third line ' considered best practice x = msgboxhello worldtext1+64+4096hello worldtitle x = msgboxhello worldtext4161hello worldtitle x = msgboxhello worldtext vbokcancel+vbinformation+vbsystemmodal hello

vbyesnocancel specifies three x = msgboxhello worldtext vbyesnocancel+vbinformationhello worldtitle msgbox result & x make your computer talk vbscript can make your computer talk say any text uses sapi speech application interface let's say hello world copy try this code set sapi=wscriptcreateobjectsapispvoice sapispeak hello world it's not always necessary use sapi object terminate task vbscript can access windows management instrumentation wmi such windows task manager code below when executed would terminate kill any process involving notepadexe 'terminate all processes involving

particular areas use are noteworthy first widely used among system administrators microsoft environment this situation may change with promotion increased use windows powershell second vbscript scripting language for quick test professional test automation tool third area note adoption vbscript internal scripting language for some embedded applications such industrial operator interfaces human machine interfaces hierarchical dbms intersystems caché which has its roots language mumps also supports implementation vbscript cache basic for programming stored code vbscript omits several useful features full visual basic such strong typing extended error trapping ability pass variable number parameters subroutine however its use relatively widespread because easy learn because those who implement code language need not pay royalties microsoft long vbscript trade mark acknowledged when organization licenses visual basic for applications vba from microsoft companies such autodesk statsoft great plains accounting visio subsequently acquired by microsoft have done allowed redistribute full vba code-writing debugging environment with its product vbscript used place vba macro
