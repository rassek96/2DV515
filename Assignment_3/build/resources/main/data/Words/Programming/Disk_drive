various electronic magnetic optical mechanical changes surface layer one more rotating disks disk drive device implementing such storage mechanism notable types are hard disk drive hdd containing non-removable disk floppy disk drive fdd its removable floppy disk various optical disc drives associated optical disc media spelling disk disc are used interchangeably except where trademarks preclude one usage eg compact disc logo choice particular form frequently historical ibm's usage disk form beginning with ibm disk storage unit six hard disk drives three floppy disk drives cd-rom optical disc drive contents background access methods rotation speed track layout interfaces basic terminology see also references background audio information was originally recorded by analog methods see sound recording reproduction similarly first video disc used analog recording method music industry analog recording has been mostly replaced by digital optical technology where data are recorded digital format with optical information first commercial digital disk storage device was ibm which shipped part ibm ramac computing system random-access low-density storage disks was developed complement already used sequential-access high-density storage provided by tape drives using magnetic tape vigorous innovation disk storage technology coupled with less vigorous innovation tape storage has reduced difference acquisition cost per terabyte between disk storage tape storage however total cost ownership data on disk including power management remains larger than that tape disk storage now used both computer storage consumer electronic storage eg audio cds video discs standard dvd blu-ray access methods digital disk drives are block storage devices each disk divided into logical blocks collection sectors blocks are addressed using their logical block addresses lba read from writing disk happens at granularity blocks originally disk capacity was quite low has been improved one several ways improvements mechanical design manufacture allowed smaller more precise heads meaning that more tracks could be stored on each disks advancements data compression methods permitted more information be stored each individual sectors drive stores data onto cylinders heads sectors sectors unit smallest size data be stored hard disk drive each file will have many sectors units assigned smallest entity cd called frame which consists bytes contains six complete 16-bit stereo samples two bytes × two channels × six samples = bytes other nine bytes consist eight circ error-correction bytes one subcode byte used for control display information sent from computer processor bios into chip controlling data transfer this then sent out hard drive via multi-wire connector once data are received onto circuit board drive they are translated compressed into format that individual drive can use store onto disk itself data are then passed chip on circuit board that controls access drive drive divided into sectors data stored onto one sides one internal disks hdd with two disks internally will typically store data on all four surfaces hardware on drive tells actuator arm where go for relevant track compressed information then sent down head which changes physical properties optically magnetically for example each byte on drive thus storing information file not stored linear manner rather held best way for quickest retrieval rotation speed track layout comparison several forms disk storage showing tracks not-to-scale green denotes start red denotes end some cd-rw dvd-rw/dvd+rw recorders operate zclv caa cav modes mechanically there are two different motions occurring inside drive one rotation disks inside device other side-to-side motion head across disk moves between tracks there are two types disk rotation methods constant linear velocity used mainly optical storage varies rotational speed optical disc depending upon position head constant angular velocity used hdds standard fdds few optical disc systems vinyl audio records spins media at one constant speed regardless where head positioned track positioning also follows two different methods across disk storage devices storage devices focused on holding computer data eg hdds fdds iomega zip drives use concentric tracks store data during sequential read write operation after drive accesses all sectors track repositions heads next track this will cause momentary delay flow data between device computer contrast optical audio video discs use single spiral track that starts at inner most point on disc flows continuously outer edge when reading writing data there no need stop flow data switch tracks this similar vinyl records except vinyl records started at outer edge spiraled toward center interfaces disk drive interface mechanism/protocol communication between rest system disk drive itself storage devices intended for desktop mobile computers typically use ata pata sata interfaces enterprise systems high-end storage devices will typically use scsi sas fc interfaces addition some use sata basic terminology disk - generally refers magnetic media devices disc - required by trademarks for certain optical media devices platter – individual recording disk hard disk drive contains set platters developments optical technology have led multiple recording layers on dvds spindle – spinning axle on which platters are mounted rotation – platters rotate two techniques are common o constant angular velocity cav keeps disk spinning at fixed rate measured revolutions per minute rpm this means heads cover more distance per unit time on outer tracks than on inner tracks this method typical with computer hard drives o constant linear velocity clv keeps distance covered by heads per unit time fixed thus disk has slow down arm moves outer tracks this method typical for cd drives track – circle recorded data on single recording surface platter sector – segment track low level formatting – establishing tracks sectors head – device that reads writes information—magnetic optical—on disk surface arm – mechanical assembly that supports head moves out seek time – time needed move head new position specific track rotational latency – average time once arm on right track before head over desired sector data transfer rate - rate at which user data bits are transferred from medium technically this would more accurately be entitled gross data transfer rate see also disk drive performance characteristics raid usb flash drive disk array references
