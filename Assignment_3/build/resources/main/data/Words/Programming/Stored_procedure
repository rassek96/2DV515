stored procedure from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search stored procedure also termed proc storp sproc stopro storedproc storeproc sp sp subroutine available applications that access relational database management system rdms such procedures are stored database data dictionary typical uses for stored procedures include data-validation integrated into database access-control mechanisms furthermore stored procedures can consolidate centralize logic that was originally implemented applications save time & memory extensive complex processing that requires execution several sql statements can be saved into stored procedures all applications call procedures one can use nested stored procedures by executing one stored procedure from within another stored procedures are similar user-defined functions udfs major difference that udfs can be used like any other expression within sql statements whereas stored procedures must be invoked using call statement call procedure execute procedure stored procedures may return result sets ie results select statement such result sets can be processed using cursors by other stored procedures by associating result-set locator by applications stored procedures may also contain declared variables for processing data cursors that allow loop through multiple rows table stored-procedure flow-control statements typically include if while loop repeat case statements more stored procedures can receive variables return results modify variables return them depending on how where variable declared contents implementation comparison with dynamic sql other uses comparison with functions comparison with prepared statements disadvantages references external links implementation exact correct implementation stored procedures varies from one database system other most major database vendors support them some form depending on database system stored procedures can be implemented variety programming languages for example sql java c c++ stored procedures written non-sql languages may may not execute sql statements themselves increasing adoption stored procedures led introduction procedural elements sql language sql1999 sql2003 standards part sql/psm that made sql imperative programming language most database systems offer proprietary vendor-specific extensions exceeding sql/psm standard specification for java stored procedures exists well sql/jrt database system implementation language cubrid java db2 sql pl close sql/psm standard java firebird psql fyracle also supports portions oracle's pl/sql informix spl java microsoft sql server transact-sql various net framework languages mysql own stored procedures closely adhering sql/psm standard nuodb sql java oracle pl/sql java postgresql pl/pgsql can also use own function languages such pl/perl pl/php sap hana sql r sybase ase transact-sql comparison with dynamic sql overhead because stored procedure statements are stored directly database they may remove all part compiling overhead that typically needed situations where software applications send inline dynamic sql queries database however most database systems implement statement caches other methods avoid repetitively compiling dynamic sql statements also while they avoid some pre-compiled sql statements add complexity creating optimal execution plan because not all arguments sql statement are supplied at compile time depending on specific database implementation configuration mixed performance results will be seen from stored procedures versus generic queries user defined functions avoiding network traffic major advantage stored procedures that they can run directly within database engine production system this typically means that procedures run entirely on specialized database server which has direct access data being accessed benefit here that network communication costs can be avoided completely this becomes more important for complex series sql statements encapsulating business logic stored procedures allow programmers embed business logic api database which can simplify data management reduce need encode logic elsewhere client programs this can result lesser likelihood data corruption by faulty client programs database system can ensure data integrity consistency with help stored procedures delegating access-rights many systems stored procedures can be granted access rights database that users who execute those procedures do not directly have some protection from sql injection attacks stored procedures can be used protect against injection attacks stored procedure parameters will be treated data even if attacker inserts sql commands also some dbms will check parameter's type however stored procedure that turn generates dynamic sql using input still vulnerable sql injections unless proper precautions are taken other uses some systems stored procedures can be used control transaction management others stored procedures run inside transaction such that transactions are effectively transparent them stored procedures can also be invoked from database trigger condition handler for example stored procedure may be triggered by insert on specific table update specific field table code inside stored procedure would be executed writing stored procedures condition handlers also allows database administrators track errors system with greater detail by using stored procedures catch errors record some audit information database external resource like file comparison with functions function subprogram written perform certain computations scalar function returns only one value null whereas table function returns relational table comprising zero more rows each row with one more columns functions must return value using return keyword but for stored procedures this not mandatory stored procedures can use return keyword but with no value being passed functions could be used select statements provided they do no data manipulation however procedures cannot be included select statements stored procedure can return multiple values using out parameter return no value stored procedure saves query compiling time stored procedure database object stored procedure material object comparison with prepared statements prepared statements take ordinary statement query parameterize so that different literal values can be used at later time like stored procedures they are stored on server for efficiency provide some protection from sql injection attacks although simpler more declarative prepared statements are not ordinarily written use procedural logic cannot operate on variables because their simple interface client-side implementations prepared statements are more widely reusable between dbms disadvantages stored procedure languages are often vendor-specific changing database vendors usually requires rewriting existing stored procedures stored procedure languages from different vendors have different levels sophistication o for example postgres' pgpsql has more language features especially via extensions than microsoft's t-sql tool support for writing debugging stored procedures often not good for other programming languages but this differs between vendors languages o for example both pl/sql t-sql have dedicated ides debuggers pl/pgsql can be debugged from various ides changes stored procedures are harder keep track within version control system than other code changes must be reproduced scripts be stored project history be included differences procedures can be harder merge track
