unix shell from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search tcsh sh shell windows on os x desktop unix shell command-line interpreter shell that provides traditional unix-like command line user interface users direct operation computer by entering commands text for command line interpreter execute by creating text scripts one more such commands users typically interact with unix shell using terminal emulator however direct operation via serial hardware connections networking session are common for server systems all unix shells provide filename wildcarding piping here documents command substitution variables control structures for condition-testing iteration contents concept early shells o bourne shell o c shell configuration files exotic shells see also references concept most generic sense term shell means any program that users employ type commands shell hides details underlying operating system manages technical details operating system kernel interface which lowest-level inner-most component most operating systems unix-like operating systems users typically have many choices command-line interpreters for interactive sessions when user logs system interactively shell program automatically executed for duration session type shell which may be customized for each user typically stored user's profile for example local passwd file distributed configuration system such nis ldap however user may execute any other available shell interactively unix shell both interactive command language well scripting programming language used by operating system facility control shell script execution system shells created for other operating systems often provide similar functionality on hosts with windowing system like os x some users may never use shell directly on unix systems shell has historically been implementation language system startup scripts including program that starts windowing system configures networking many other essential functions however some system vendors have replaced traditional shell-based startup system init with different approaches such systemd early shells first unix shell was thompson shell sh written by ken thompson at bell labs distributed with versions through unix from though rudimentary by modern standards introduced many basic features common all later unix shells including piping simple control structures using if goto filename wildcarding though not current use still available part some ancient unix systems was modeled after multics shell itself modeled after runcom program louis pouzin showed multics team rc suffix on some unix configuration files for example vimrc remnant runcom ancestry unix shells pwb shell mashey shell sh was upward-compatible version thompson shell augmented by john mashey others distributed with programmer's workbench unix circa 1975-1977 focused on making shell programming practical especially large shared computing centers added shell variables precursors environment variables including search path mechanism that evolved into $path user-executable shell scripts interrupt-handling control structures were extended from if/goto if/then/else/endif switch/breaksw/endsw while/end/break/continue shell programming became widespread these external commands were incorporated into shell itself for performance but most widely distributed influential early unix shells were bourne shell c shell both shells have been used coding base model for many derivative work-alike shells with extended feature sets bourne shell main article bourne shell bourne shell sh was complete rewrite by stephen bourne at bell labs distributed shell for unix version introduced rest basic features considered common all unix shells including here documents command substitution more generic variables more extensive builtin control structures language including use reversed keyword mark end block was influenced by algol traditionally bourne shell program name sh its path unix file system hierarchy /bin/sh but number compatible work-alikes are also available with various improvements additional features on many systems sh may be symbolic link hard link one these alternatives almquist shell ash written bsd-licensed replacement for bourne shell often used resource-constrained environments sh freebsd netbsd their derivatives are based on ash that has been enhanced be posix conformant for occasion bourne-again shell bash written part gnu project provide superset bourne shell functionality this shell can be found installed default interactive shell for users on most linux mac os x systems debian almquist shell dash modern replacement for ash debian ubuntu korn shell ksh written by david korn based on bourne shell sources while working at bell labs public domain korn shell pdksh mirbsd korn shell mksh descendant openbsd /bin/ksh pdksh developed part miros bsd z shell zsh relatively modern shell that backward compatible with bash busybox set unix utilities for small embedded systems which includes shells ash derivative almquist shell hush independent implentation bourne shell posix standard specifies its standard shell strict subset korn shell enhanced version bourne shell from user's perspective bourne shell was immediately recognized when active by its characteristic default command line prompt character dollar sign $ c shell main article c shell c shell csh was written by bill joy while graduate student at university california berkeley widely distributed with bsd unix language including control structures expression grammar was modeled on c c shell also introduced large number features for interactive work including history editing mechanisms aliases directory stacks tilde notation cdpath job control path hashing on many systems csh may be symbolic link hard link tenex c shell tcsh improved version joy's original csh though c shell's interactive features have been copied most other current shells language itself has not been widely copied only work-alike hamilton c shell written by nicole hamilton first distributed on os/2 on windows since configuration files shells read configuration files on multiple circumstances that differ depending on shell these files usually contain commands for particular shell are executed when loaded they are usually used set important variables used find executables like
