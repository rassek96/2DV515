atlas autocode from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search atlas autocode aa was programming language developed around at manchester university for atlas computer autocode was basically early term for programming language different autocodes could be totally different unlike say different fortrans was developed by tony brooker derrick morris variant algol programming language removing some algol features such passing parameters by name which algol means passing address short subroutine recalculate parameter each time was mentioned featured explicitly typed variables subroutines functions aa compiler generated range-checking for array accesses allowed array have dimensions that were determined at run-time ie you could declare array integer array thing ij where i j were calculated values contents features syntax references external links features machine code could be included within high-level aa routines either make inner loop more efficient effect some operation which could not easily be done otherwise atlas autocode included complex data type represent complex numbers partly because pressure from electrical engineering department complex numbers are used represent behavior alternating current square root was represented by i which was treated fixed complex constant = i complex data type was dropped when atlas autocode later evolved into edinburgh imp programming language imp was extension aa was used write emas operating system atlas autocode's second-greatest claim fame after being progenitor imp emas was that had many features original compiler compiler variant aa compiler included run-time support for top-down recursive descent parser style parser used compiler compiler was use continuously at edinburgh from 60's until almost turn millennium other autocodes were developed for titan computer prototype atlas at cambridge ferranti mercury syntax atlas autocode's syntax was largely similar algol though was influenced by output device which author had available friden flexowriter consequently allowed symbols like ½ for superscript for power flexowriter supported overstriking therefore aa did well — up three characters could be overstruck single symbol for example character set had no ↑ symbol so exponentiation was overstrike | aforementioned underlining keywords could also be done using overstriking language described detail atlas autocode reference manual other flexowriter characters that were found use atlas autocode were α floating-point numbers eg 356α-7 for modern β mean second half 48-bit atlas memory word π for mathematical constant pi when aa was ported english electric kdf9 computer character set was changed iso that compiler has been recovered from old paper tape by edinburgh computer history project available online high-quality scan original edinburgh version atlas autocode manual keywords aa were distinguishable from other text by being underlined which was implemented via overstrike flexowriter compare bold algol there were also two stropping regimes first there was uppercasedelimiters mode where all uppercase letters outside strings were treated underlined lowercase second some versions but not original atlas version was possible strop keywords by placing % sign front them for example keyword endofprogramme could be typed %end %of %programme %endofprogramme this significantly reduced typing due only needing one character rather than overstriking whole keyword algol there were no reserved words language keywords were identified by underlining stropping not by recognising reserved character sequences statement if token=if then result = token there both keyword if variable named if algol aa allowed spaces variable names such integer previous value spaces were not significant were removed prior parsing trivial pre-lexing stage called line reconstruction what compiler would see above example would be iftoken=ifthenresult=token spaces were possible due partly keywords being distinguished other ways partly because source was processed by scannerless parser without separate lexing phase which allowed lexical syntax be context-sensitive syntax for expressions let multiplication operator be omitted eg 3a was treated 3a ai+j was treated ai+j if was not array ambiguous usages longest possible name was taken maximal munch for example ab was not treated ab whether not b had been declared original atlas autocode for atlas computer atlas machine code instructions could be interpolated between atlas autocode statements references b c ra brooker
