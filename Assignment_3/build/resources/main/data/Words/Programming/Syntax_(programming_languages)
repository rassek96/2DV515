source code color coded highlighting used this piece code written python computer science syntax computer language set rules that defines combinations symbols that are considered be correctly structured document fragment that language this applies both programming languages where document represents source code markup languages where document represents data syntax language defines its surface form text-based computer languages are based on sequences characters while visual programming languages are based on spatial layout connections between symbols which may be textual graphical documents that are syntactically invalid are said have syntax error syntax – form – contrasted with semantics – meaning processing computer languages semantic processing generally comes after syntactic processing but some cases semantic processing necessary for complete syntactic analysis these are done together concurrently compiler syntactic analysis comprises frontend while semantic analysis comprises backend middle end if this phase distinguished contents levels syntax o examples errors syntax definition o example lisp o complex grammars syntax versus semantics see also references external links levels syntax computer language syntax generally distinguished into three levels words – lexical level determining how characters form tokens phrases – grammar level narrowly speaking determining how tokens form phrases context – determining what objects variables names refer if types are valid etc distinguishing this way yields modularity allowing each level be described processed separately often independently first lexer turns linear sequence characters into linear sequence tokens this known lexical analysis lexing second parser turns linear sequence tokens into hierarchical syntax tree this known parsing narrowly speaking thirdly contextual analysis resolves names checks types this modularity sometimes possible but many real-world languages earlier step depends on later step – for example lexer hack c because tokenization depends on context even these cases syntactical analysis often seen approximating this ideal model parsing stage itself can be divided into two parts parse tree concrete syntax tree which determined by grammar but generally far too detailed for practical use abstract syntax tree ast which simplifies this into usable form ast contextual analysis steps can be considered form semantic analysis they are adding meaning interpretation syntax alternatively informal manual implementations syntactical rules that would be difficult awkward describe implement formally levels generally correspond levels chomsky hierarchy words are regular language specified lexical grammar which type-3 grammar generally given regular expressions phrases are context-free language cfl generally deterministic context-free language dcfl specified phrase structure grammar which type-2 grammar generally given production rules backus–naur form bnf phrase grammars are often specified much more constrained grammars than full context-free grammars order make them easier parse while lr parser can parse any dcfl linear time simple lalr parser even simpler ll parser are more efficient but can only parse grammars whose production rules are constrained contextual structure can principle be described by context-sensitive grammar automatically analyzed by means such attribute grammars though general this step done manually via name resolution rules type checking implemented via symbol table which stores names types for each scope tools have been written that automatically generate lexer from lexical specification written regular expressions parser from phrase grammar written bnf this allows one use declarative programming rather than need have procedural functional programming notable example lex-yacc pair these automatically produce concrete syntax tree parser writer must then manually write code describing how this converted abstract syntax tree contextual analysis also generally implemented manually despite existence these automatic tools parsing often implemented manually for various reasons – perhaps phrase structure not context-free alternative implementation improves performance error-reporting allows grammar be changed more easily parsers are often written functional languages such haskell scripting languages such python perl c c++ examples errors main article syntax error example add syntactically valid lisp program assuming 'add' function exists else name resolution fails adding however following are invalid lexical error '' not valid add parsing error missing closing '' note that lexer unable identify first error – all knows that after producing token leftparen '' remainder program invalid since no word rule begins with '' second error detected at parsing stage parser has identified list production rule due '' token only match thus can give error message general may be ambiguous type errors undeclared variable errors are sometimes considered be syntax errors when they are detected at compile-time which usually case when compiling strongly-typed languages though common classify these kinds error semantic errors instead example python code 'a' + contains type error because adds string literal integer literal type errors this kind can be detected at compile-time they can be detected during parsing phrase analysis if compiler uses separate rules that allow integerliteral + integerliteral but not stringliteral + integerliteral though more likely that compiler will use parsing rule that allows all expressions form literaloridentifier + literaloridentifier then error will be detected during contextual analysis when type checking occurs some cases this validation not done by compiler these errors are only detected at runtime weakly typed language where type can only be determined at runtime many type errors can only be detected at runtime for example python code + b syntactically valid at phrase level but correctness types b can only be determined at runtime variables do not have types python only values do whereas there disagreement about whether type error detected by compiler should be called syntax error rather than static semantic error type errors which can only be detected at program execution time are always regarded semantic rather than syntax errors syntax definition parse tree python code with inset tokenization syntax textual programming languages usually defined using combination regular expressions for lexical structure backus–naur form for grammatical structure inductively specify syntactic categories nonterminals terminal symbols syntactic categories are defined by rules called productions which specify values that belong particular syntactic category terminal symbols are concrete characters strings characters for example keywords such define if let void from which syntactically valid programs are constructed language can have different equivalent grammars such equivalent regular expressions at lexical levels different phrase rules which generate same language using broader category grammars such lr grammars can allow shorter simpler grammars compared with more restricted categories such ll grammar which may require longer grammars with more rules different but equivalent phrase grammars yield different parse trees though underlying language set valid documents same example lisp below simple grammar defined using notation regular expressions backus–naur form describes syntax lisp which defines productions for syntactic categories expression atom number symbol list expression = atom | list atom = number | symbol number = + symbol = list = '' expression '' this grammar specifies following expression either atom list atom either number symbol number unbroken sequence one more decimal digits optionally preceded by plus minus sign symbol letter followed by zero more any characters excluding whitespace list matched pair parentheses with zero more expressions inside here decimal digits upper- lower-case characters parentheses are terminal symbols following are examples well-formed token sequences this grammar '12345' '' 'a b c232 1' complex grammars grammar needed specify programming language can be classified by its position chomsky hierarchy phrase grammar most programming languages can be specified using type-2 grammar ie they are context-free grammars though overall syntax context-sensitive due variable declarations nested scopes hence type-1 however there are exceptions for some languages phrase grammar type-0 turing-complete some languages like perl lisp specification implementation language allows constructs that execute during parsing phase furthermore these languages have constructs that allow programmer alter behavior parser this combination effectively blurs distinction between parsing execution makes syntax analysis undecidable problem these languages meaning that parsing phase may not finish for example perl possible execute code during parsing using begin statement perl function prototypes may alter syntactic interpretation possibly even syntactic validity remaining code colloquially this referred only perl can parse perl because code must be executed during parsing can modify grammar more strongly even perl cannot parse perl because undecidable similarly lisp macros introduced by defmacro syntax also execute during parsing meaning that lisp compiler must have entire lisp run-time system present contrast c macros are merely string replacements do not require code execution syntax versus semantics syntax language describes form valid program but does not provide any information about meaning program results executing that program meaning given combination symbols handled by semantics either formal hard-coded reference implementation not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed per language's rules may depending on language specification soundness implementation result error on translation execution some cases such programs may exhibit undefined behavior even when program well-defined within language may still have meaning that not intended by person who wrote using natural language example may not be possible assign meaning grammatically correct sentence sentence may be false colorless green ideas sleep furiously grammatically well formed but has no generally accepted meaning john married bachelor grammatically well formed but expresses meaning that cannot be true following c language fragment syntactically correct but performs operation that not semantically defined because p null pointer operations p->real p->im have no meaning complex p = null complex absp = sqrt p->real p->real + p->im p->im simpler example int x printf%d x syntactically valid but not semantically defined uses uninitialized variable even though compilers for some programming languages eg java c would detect uninitialized variable errors this kind they should be regarded semantic errors rather than syntax
