uniform type identifier uti publicxml developed by iso type format markup language extended from gml extended html xml standard iso standard generalized markup language sgml iso standard for defining generalized markup languages for documents iso annex a1 defines generalized markup generalized markup based on two postulates markup should be declarative should describe document's structure other attributes rather than specify processing be performed on declarative markup less likely conflict with unforeseen future processing needs techniques markup should be rigorous so that techniques available for processing rigorously-defined objects like programs databases can be used for processing documents well html was theoretically example sgml-based language until html which admits that browsers cannot parse sgml for compatibility reasons codifies exactly what they must do instead docbook sgml linuxdoc are better examples they were used almost exclusively with actual sgml tools

goldfarb edward mosher raymond lorie developed 1960s goldfarb editor international standard coined “gml” term using their surname initials goldfarb also wrote definitive work on sgml syntax sgml handbook syntax sgml closer cocoa format document markup language sgml was originally designed enable sharing machine-readable large-project documents government law industry many such documents must remain readable for several decades—a long time information technology field sgml also was extensively applied by military aerospace technical reference industrial publishing industries advent xml profile has made sgml suitable for widespread application for small-scale general-purpose use fragment oxford english dictionary showing sgml markup document validity sgml enr+www defines two kinds validity according revised terms definitions iso from public draft conforming sgml document must be either type-valid sgml document tag-valid sgml document both note user may wish enforce additional constraints on document such whether document instance integrally-stored free entity references type-valid sgml document defined by standard sgml document which for each document instance there associated document type declaration dtd whose dtd that instance conforms tag-valid sgml document defined by standard sgml document all whose document instances are fully tagged there need not be document type declaration associated with any instances note if there document type declaration instance can be parsed with without reference terminology tag-validity was introduced sgml enr+www support xml which allows documents with no doctype declaration but which can be parsed without grammar documents which have doctype declaration that makes no xml infoset contributions document standard calls this fully tagged integrally stored reflects xml requirement that elements end same entity which they started reference-free reflects html requirement that entity references are for special characters do not contain markup sgml validity commentary especially commentary that was made before that unaware sgml enr+www covers type-validity only sgml emphasis on validity supports requirement for generalized markup that markup should be rigorous iso a1 syntax sgml document may have three parts sgml declaration prologue containing doctype declaration with various markup declarations that together make document type definition dtd instance itself containing one top-most element its contents sgml document may be composed from many entities discrete pieces text sgml entities element types used document may be specified with dtd different character sets features delimiter sets keywords are specified sgml declaration create concrete syntax document although full sgml allows implicit markup some other kinds tags xml specification s431 states each xml document has both logical physical structure physically document composed units called entities entity may refer other entities cause their inclusion document document begins root document entity logically document composed declarations elements comments character references processing instructions all which are indicated document by explicit markup for introductory information on basic modern sgml syntax see xml following material concentrates on features not xml not comprehensive summary sgml syntax optional features sgml generalizes supports wide range markup languages found mid 1980s these ranged from terse wiki-like syntaxes rtf-like bracketed languages html-like matching-tag languages sgml did this by relatively simple default reference concrete syntax augmented with large number optional features that could be enabled sgml declaration not every sgml parser can necessarily process every sgml document because each processor's system declaration can be compared document's sgml declaration always possible know whether document supported by particular processor many sgml features relate markup minimization other features relate concurrent parallel markup concur linking processing attributes link embedding sgml documents within sgml documents subdoc notion customizable features was not appropriate for web use so one goal xml was minimize optional features however xml's well-formedness rules cannot support wiki-like languages leaving them unstandardized difficult integrate with non-text information systems concrete abstract syntaxes usual default sgml concrete syntax resembles this example which default html concrete syntax typically something like this sgml provides abstract syntax that can be implemented many different types concrete syntax although markup norm using angle brackets start- end- tag delimiters sgml document per standard-defined reference concrete syntax possible use other characters—provided suitable concrete syntax defined document's sgml declaration for example sgml interpreter might be programmed parse gml wherein tags are delimited with left colon right full stop thus e prefix denotes end tag xmphello worldexmp according reference syntax letter-case upper- lower- not distinguished tag names thus three tags i ii iii are equivalent note concrete syntax might change this rule via namecase naming declarations markup minimization sgml has features for reducing number characters required mark up document which must be enabled sgml declaration sgml processors need not support every available feature thus allowing applications tolerate many types inadvertent markup omissions however sgml systems usually are intolerant invalid structures xml intolerant syntax omissions does not require dtd for validation omittag both start tags end tags may be omitted from document instance provided omittag feature enabled sgml declaration dtd indicates that tags are permitted be omitted for start tags element has no associated required required attributes tag can be unambiguously inferred by context for example if omittag yes specified sgml declaration enabling omittag feature dtd includes following declarations then this excerpt introduction sgml sgml declaration which omits two tags two tags would represent valid markup note also that omitting tags optional – same excerpt could be tagged like this introduction sgml sgml declaration would still represent valid markup note omittag feature unrelated tagging elements whose declared content empty defined dtd elements defined like this have no end tag specifying one document instance would result invalid markup this syntactically different than xml empty elements this regard shortref tags can be replaced with delimiter strings for terser markup via shortref feature this markup style now associated with wiki markup eg wherein two equals-signs == at start line are “heading start-tag” two equals signs == after that are “heading end-tag” shorttag sgml markup languages whose concrete syntax enables shorttag value feature do not require attribute values containing only alphanumeric characters be enclosed within quotation marks—either double lit single ' ' lita—so that previous markup example could be written typically something like this one feature sgml markup languages presumptuous empty tagging such that empty end tag this inherits its value from nearest previous full start tag which this example other words closes most recently opened item expression thus equivalent this net another feature net null end tag construction this other features additionally shorttag netenabl immednet feature allows shortening tags surrounding empty text value but forbids shortening full tags can be written wherein first slash / stands for net-enabling “start-tag close” nestc second slash stands for net note xml defines nestc with / net with > angled bracket—hence corresponding construct xml appears third feature 'text on same line' allowing markup item be ended with line-end especially useful for headings such requiring using either shortref datatag minimization for example if dtd includes following declarations > &re&rs short-reference delimiter concrete syntax then first line second line equivalent first line second line formal characterization sgml has many features that defied convenient description with popular formal automata theory contemporary parser technology 1980s 1990s standard warns annex h sgml model group notation was deliberately designed resemble regular expression notation automata theory because automata theory provides theoretical foundation for some aspects notion conformance content model no assumption should be made about general applicability automata content models report on early implementation parser for basic sgml amsterdam sgml parser notes dtd-grammar sgml must conform notion unambiguity which closely resembles ll1 conditions specifies various differences there appears be no definitive classification full sgml against known class formal grammar plausible classes may include tree-adjoining grammars adaptive grammars xml described being generally parsable like two-level grammar for non-validated xml conway-style pipeline coroutines lexer parser validator for valid xml sgml productions iso standard are reported be ll3 ll4 xml-class subsets are reported be expressible using w-grammar according one paper probably considered at information set parse tree level rather than character delimiter level class documents that conform given sgml document grammar forms ll1 language … sgml document grammars by themselves are however not ll1 grammars sgml standard does not define sgml with formal data structures such parse trees however sgml document constructed rooted directed acyclic graph rdag physical storage units known “entities” which parsed into rdag structural units known “elements” physical graph loosely characterized entity tree but entities might appear multiple times moreover structure graph also loosely characterized element tree but id/idref markup allows arbitrary arcs results parsing can also be understood data tree different notations where document root node entities other notations text graphics are child nodes sgml provides apparatus for linking annotating external non-sgml entities sgml standard describes terms maps recognition modes s961 each entity each element can have associated notation declared content type which determines kinds references tags which will be recognized that entity element also each element can have associated delimiter map short reference map which determines which characters are treated delimiters context sgml standard characterizes parsing state machine switching between recognition modes during parsing there stack maps that configure scanner while tokenizer relates recognition modes parsing involves traversing dynamically-retrieved entity graph finding/implying tags element structure validating those tags against grammar unusual aspect sgml that grammar dtd used both passively — recognize lexical structures actively — generate missing structures tags that dtd has declared optional end- start- tags can be omitted because they can be inferred loosely series tags can be omitted only if there single possible path grammar imply them was this active use grammars that made concrete sgml parsing difficult formally characterize sgml uses term validation for both recognition generation xml does not use grammar dtd change delimiter maps inform parse modes does not allow tag omission consequently xml validation elements not active sense that sgml validation active sgml without dtd eg simple xml grammar language sgml with dtd metalanguage sgml with sgml declaration perhaps meta-metalanguage since metalanguage whose declaration mechanism metalanguage sgml has abstract syntax implemented by many possible concrete syntaxes however this not same usage abstract syntax tree concrete syntax tree sgml usage concrete syntax set specific delimiters while abstract syntax set names for delimiters xml infoset corresponds more programming language notion abstract syntax introduced by john mccarthy derivatives xml main article xml w3c xml extensible markup language profile subset sgml designed ease implementation parser compared full sgml parser primarily for use on world wide web addition disabling many sgml options present reference syntax such omitting tags nested subdocuments xml adds number additional restrictions on kinds sgml syntax for example despite enabling sgml shortened tag forms xml does not allow unclosed start end tags also relied on many additions made by websgml annex xml currently more widely used than full sgml xml has lightweight internationalization based on unicode applications xml include xhtml xquery xslt xforms xpointer jsp svg rss atom xml-rpc rdf/xml soap html main article html while html was developed partially independently parallel with sgml its creator tim berners-lee intended be application sgml design html hyper text markup language was therefore inspired by sgml tagging but since no clear expansion parsing guidelines were established most actual html documents are not valid sgml documents later html was reformulated version be more sgml application however html markup language has many legacy- exception- handling features that differ from sgml's requirements html sgml application that fully conforms iso – sgml charter for recently revived world wide web consortium html working group says group will not assume that sgml parser used for 'classic html' although html syntax closely resembles sgml syntax with default reference concrete syntax html5 abandons any attempt define html sgml application explicitly defining its own parsing rules which more closely match existing implementations documents does however define alternative xhtml serialization which conforms xml therefore sgml well oed second edition oxford english dictionary oed entirely marked up with sgml-based markup language third edition marked up xml others other document markup languages are partly related sgml xml but — because they cannot be parsed validated other-wise processed using standard sgml
