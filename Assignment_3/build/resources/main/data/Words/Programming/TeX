/ˈtɛk/ see below typesetting system formatting system designed mostly written by donald knuth released together with metafont language for font description computer modern family typefaces tex was designed with two main goals mind allow anybody produce high-quality books using minimal effort provide system that would give exactly same results on all computers at any point timetex free software which has made more accessible wider range users tex popular means by which typeset complex mathematical formulae has been noted one most sophisticated digital typographical systems world tex popular academia especially mathematics computer science economics engineering physics statistics quantitative psychology has largely displaced unix troff other favored formatting system many unix installations which use both for different purposes also used for many other typesetting tasks especially form latex context other template packages widely used mime type for tex application/x-tex

language development o packages o editors o license use tex pronunciation spelling community see also notes references external links history when first paper volume donald knuth's art computer programming was published was typeset using hot metal typesetting set by monotype corporation typecaster this method dating back 19th century produced good classic style appreciated by knuth when second edition second volume was published whole book had be typeset again because monotype technology had been largely replaced by phototypesetting original fonts were no longer available when knuth received galley proofs new book on march he found them awful around that time knuth saw for first time output high-quality digital typesetting system became interested digital typography disappointing galley proofs gave him final motivation solve problem at hand once for all by designing his own typesetting system on may he wrote memo himself describing basic features tex he planned finish on his sabbatical but happened language was not frozen ready use until more than ten years later guy steele happened be at stanford during summer when knuth was developing his first version tex when steele returned massachusetts institute technology that autumn he rewrote tex's input/output i/o run under incompatible timesharing system its operating system first version tex was written sail programming language run on pdp-10 under stanford's waits operating system for later versions tex knuth invented concept literate programming way producing compilable source code cross-linked documentation typeset tex from same original file language used called web produces programs dec pdp-10 pascal new version tex rewritten from scratch called tex82 was published among other changes original hyphenation algorithm was replaced by new algorithm written by frank liang tex82 also uses fixed-point arithmetic instead floating-point ensure reproducibility results across different computer hardware includes real turing-complete programming language following intense lobbying by guy steele donald knuth released new versions tex metafont despite his desire keep program stable knuth realised that different characters for text input were not enough accommodate foreign languages main change version tex thus ability work with 8-bit inputs allowing different characters text input since version tex has used idiosyncratic version numbering system where updates have been indicated by adding extra digit at end decimal so that version number asymptotically approaches π this reflection fact that tex now very stable only minor updates are anticipated current version tex was last updated design was frozen after version no new feature fundamental change will be added so all newer versions will contain only bug fixes even though donald knuth himself has suggested few areas which tex could have been improved he indicated that he firmly believes that having unchanged system that will produce same output now future more important than introducing new features for this reason he has stated that absolutely final change be made after my death will be change version number π at which point all remaining bugs will become features likewise versions metafont after asymptotically approach e similar change will be applied after knuth's death since source code tex essentially public domain see below other programmers are allowed explicitly encouraged improve system but are required use another name distribute modified tex meaning that source code can still evolve for example omega project was developed after primarily enhance tex's multilingual typesetting abilities knuth created unofficial modified versions such tex-xet which allows user mix texts written left-to-right right-to-left writing systems same document typesetting system tex commands commonly start with backslash are grouped with curly braces almost all tex's syntactic properties can be changed on fly which makes tex input hard parse by anything but tex itself tex macro- token-based language many commands including most user-defined ones are expanded on fly until only unexpandable tokens remain which are then executed expansion itself practically free from side effects tail recursion macros takes no memory if-then-else constructs are available this makes tex turing-complete language even at expansion level system can be divided into four levels first characters are read from input file assigned category code sometimes called catcode for short combinations backslash actually any character category zero followed by letters characters category single other character are replaced by control-sequence token this sense this stage like lexical analysis although does not form numbers from digits next stage expandable control sequences such conditionals defined macros are replaced by their replacement text input for third stage then stream characters including ones with special meaning unexpandable control sequences typically assignments visual commands here characters get assembled into paragraph tex's paragraph breaking algorithm works by optimizing breakpoints over whole paragraph fourth stage breaks vertical list lines other material into pages tex system has precise knowledge sizes all characters symbols using this information computes optimal arrangement letters per line lines per page then produces dvi file device independent containing final locations all characters this dvi file can be printed directly given appropriate printer driver can be converted other formats nowadays pdftex often used which bypasses dvi generation altogether base tex system understands about commands called primitives these low-level commands are rarely used directly by users most functionality provided by format files predumped memory images tex after large macro collections have been loaded knuth's original default format which adds about commands plain tex most widely used format latex originally developed by leslie lamport which incorporates document styles for books letters slides etc adds support for referencing automatic numbering sections equations another widely used format ams-tex produced by american mathematical society provides many more user-friendly commands which can be altered by journals fit with their house style most features ams-tex can be used latex by using ams packages this then referred ams-latex other formats include context used primarily for desktop publishing written mostly by hans hagen at pragma how run sample page produced using tex with latex macros sample hello world program plain tex hello world \bye % marks end file not shown final output this might be file myfiletex tex common file extension for plain tex files by default everything that follows percent sign on line comment ignored by tex running tex on this file for example by typing tex myfiletex command-line interpreter by calling from graphical user interface will create output file called myfiledvi representing content page device independent format dvi dvi file could then either be viewed on screen converted suitable format for any various printers for which device driver existed printer support was generally not operating system feature at time that tex was created knuth has said that there nothing inherent tex that requires dvi output format later versions tex notably pdftex xetex luatex all support output directly pdf mathematical example tex provides different text syntax specifically for mathematical formulas for example quadratic formula which solution quadratic equation appears markup renders quadratic formula $-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$ \bye quadratic formula − b ± b − c {\displaystyle {\hbox{the quadratic formula }}\textstyle {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}} \over 2a}} formula printed way person would write by hand typeset equation document entering mathematics mode done by starting with $ symbol then entering formula tex syntax closing again with another same symbol knuth explained jest that he chose dollar sign indicate beginning end mathematical mode plain tex because typesetting mathematics was traditionally supposed be expensive display mathematics mathematics presented centered on new line similar but uses $$ instead single $ symbol for example above with quadratic formula display math markup renders quadratic formula $$-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$$ \bye quadratic formula {\displaystyle {\hbox{the quadratic formula is}}\} − b ± b − c {\displaystyle -b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}} \over 2a} novel aspects tex software incorporates several aspects that were not available were lower quality other typesetting programs at time when tex was released some innovations are based on interesting algorithms have led several theses for knuth's students while some these discoveries have now been incorporated into other typesetting programs others such rules for mathematical spacing are still unique mathematical spacing mathematical text typeset using tex ams euler font since primary goal tex language high-quality typesetting for publishers books knuth gave lot attention spacing rules for mathematical formulae he took three bodies work that he considered be standards excellence for mathematical typography books typeset by addison-wesley publishing's house publisher art computer programming particular work hans wolf joseph louis lagrange thermodynamics innovation editions mathematical journal acta mathematica dating from around copy indagationes mathematicae dutch mathematics journal knuth looked closely at these printed papers sort out look for set rules for spacing while tex provides some basic rules tools needed specify proper spacing exact parameters depend on font used typeset formula for example spacing for knuth's computer modern fonts has been precisely fine-tuned over years now set but when other fonts such ams euler were used by knuth for first time new spacing parameters had be defined typesetting math tex not without criticism particularly with respect technical details font metrics which were designed era when significant attention was paid storage requirements this resulted some hacks overloading some fields which turn required other hacks on aesthetics level rendering radicals has also been criticized opentype math font specification largely borrows from tex but has some new features/enhancements hyphenation justification comparison with manual typesetting problem justification easy solve with digital system such tex which provided that good points for line breaking have been defined can automatically spread spaces between words fill line problem thus find set breakpoints that will give most visually pleasing result many line breaking algorithms use first-fit approach where breakpoints for each line are determined one after other no breakpoint changed after has been chosen such system not able define breakpoint depending on effect that will have on following lines comparison total-fit line breaking algorithm used by tex developed by donald knuth michael plass considers all possible breakpoints paragraph finds combination line breaks that will produce most globally pleasing arrangement formally algorithm defines value called badness associated with each possible line break badness increased if spaces on line must stretch shrink too much make line correct width penalties are added if breakpoint particularly undesirable for example if word must be hyphenated if two lines row are hyphenated if very loose line immediately followed by very tight line algorithm will then find breakpoints that will minimize sum squares badness including penalties resulting lines if paragraph contains n {\displaystyle n} possible breakpoints number situations that must be evaluated naively n {\displaystyle 2^{n}} however by using method dynamic programming complexity algorithm can be brought down o n {\displaystyle on^{2}} see big o notation further simplifications for example not testing extremely unlikely breakpoints such hyphenation first word paragraph lead efficient algorithm whose running time almost always order n {\displaystyle n} similar algorithm used determine best way break paragraphs across two pages order avoid widows orphans lines that appear alone on page while rest paragraph on following preceding page however general thesis by michael plass shows how page breaking problem can be np-complete because added complication placing figures tex's line breaking algorithm has been adopted by several other programs such adobe indesign desktop publishing application gnu fmt unix command line utility if no suitable line break can be found for line system will try hyphenate word original version tex used hyphenation algorithm based on set rules for removal prefixes suffixes words for deciding if should insert break between two consonants pattern form vowel–consonant–consonant–vowel which possible most time tex82 introduced new hyphenation algorithm designed by frank liang assign priorities breakpoints letter groups list hyphenation patterns first generated automatically from corpus hyphenated words list words if tex must find acceptable hyphenation positions word encyclopedia for example will consider all subwords extended word encyclopedia where special marker indicate beginning end word list subwords includes all subwords length e n c y etc length e en nc etc etc up subword length which word itself including markers tex will then look into its list hyphenation patterns find subwords for which has calculated desirability hyphenation at each position case our word such patterns can be matched namely 1c4l4 1cy 1d4i3a 4edi e3dia 2i1a ope5d 2p2ed 3pedi pedia4 y1c for each position word tex will calculate maximum value obtained among all matching patterns yielding en1cy1c4l4o3p4e5d4i3a4 finally acceptable positions are those indicated by odd number yielding acceptable hyphenations en-cy-clo-pe-di-a this system based on subwords allows definition very general patterns such 2i1a with low indicative numbers either odd even which can then be superseded by more specific patterns such 1d4i3a if necessary these patterns find about 90% hyphens original dictionary more importantly they do not insert any spurious hyphen addition list exceptions words for which patterns do not predict correct hyphenation are included with plain tex format additional ones can be specified by user metafont main article metafont metafont not strictly part tex font description system which allows designer describe characters algorithmically uses bézier curves fairly standard way generate actual characters be displayed but knuth devotes lots attention rasterizing problem on bitmapped displays another thesis by john hobby further explores this problem digitizing brush trajectories this term derives from fact that metafont describes characters having been drawn by abstract brushes erasers commonly believed that tex based on bitmap fonts but fact these programs know nothing about fonts that they are using other than their dimensions responsibility device driver appropriately handle fonts other types including postscript type truetype computer modern commonly known tex font freely available type format are ams math fonts users tex systems that output directly pdf such pdftex xetex luatex generally never use metafont output at all macro language tex provides unusual macro language definition macro not only includes list commands but also syntax call macros are completely integrated with full-scale interpreted compile-time language that also guides processing tex's macro level operation lexical but built-in facility tex that makes use syntax interpretation comparing with most widely used lexical preprocessors like m4 differs slightly body macro gets tokenized at definition time that not completely raw text except for few very special cases this gives same behaviour tex macro language has been successfully used extend tex for instance latex context development original source code for current tex software written web mixture documentation written tex pascal subset order ensure portability for example tex does all its dynamic allocation itself from fixed-size arrays uses only fixed-point arithmetic for its internal calculations result tex has been ported almost all operating systems usually by using web2c program convert source code into c instead directly compiling pascal code knuth has kept very detailed log all bugs he has corrected changes he has made program since list contains entries not including version modification that should be done after his death final change tex donald knuth offers monetary awards people who find report bug tex award per bug started at us$256 one hexadecimal dollar doubled every year until was frozen at its current value $32768 knuth has lost relatively little money there have been very few bugs claimed addition recipients have been known frame their check proof that they found bug tex rather than cashing due scammers finding scanned copies his checks on internet using them try drain his bank account knuth no longer sends out real checks but those who submit bug reports can get credit at bank san serriffe instead packages tex usually provided form easy-to-install bundle tex itself along with metafont all necessary fonts documents formats utilities needed use typesetting system on unix-compatible systems including gnu/linux apple mac os x tex distributed form tetex distribution more recently tex live distribution on microsoft windows there miktex distribution enhanced by protext microsoft windows version tex live several document processing systems are based on tex notably jadetex which uses tex backend for printing from james clark's dsssl engine arbortext publishing system texinfo gnu documentation processing system tex has been official typesetting package for gnu operating system since xetex new tex engine that supports unicode originally making use advanced apple mac os x -specific font technologies now supports opentype available on gnu/linux ms windows numerous extensions companion programs for tex exist among them bibtex for bibliographies distributed with latex pdftex which bypasses dvi produces output adobe systems's portable document format omega which allows tex use unicode character set most tex extensions are available for free from ctan comprehensive tex archive network editors see also comparison tex editors there are variety editors designed work with tex texmacs text editor wysiwyw scientific text editor inspired by both tex emacs uses knuth's

kile provides such ide texmaker pure qt equivalent kile with user interface that nearly same kile's texstudio open-source fork texmaker that offers different approach configurability features free downloadable binaries are provided for windows linux mac os x os/2 freebsd most recent editor for microsoft windows texlab which supports latex pdftex xetex freeware program developed using win32 wintempla gnu emacs has various built-in third-party packages with support for tex major one being auctex for vim possible plugins include vim-latex suite automatic tex tex-9 for google docs auto-latex equations google docs add-on that provides mathematical tex typesetting mathjax supported license donald knuth has indicated several times that source code tex has been placed into public domain he strongly encourages modifications experimentations with this source code since code still copyrighted technically free/open-source software not public domain legal sense particular since knuth highly values reproducibility output all versions tex any changed version must not be called tex anything confusingly similar enforce this rule any implementation system must pass test suite called trip test before being allowed be called tex question license somewhat confused by statements included at beginning tex source code which indicate that all rights are reserved copying this file authorized only if you make absolutely no changes your copy this restriction should be interpreted prohibition change source code long file called texweb this interpretation confirmed later source code when trip test mentioned if this program changed resulting system should not be called 'tex' american mathematical society tried early 1980s claim trademark for tex this was rejected because at time tex all caps was registered by honeywell for text executive text processing system use tex several technical fields particular computer science mathematics engineering physics tex has become de facto standard many thousands books have been published using tex including books published by addison-wesley cambridge university press elsevier oxford university press springer numerous journals these fields are produced using tex latex allowing authors submit their raw manuscript written tex while many publications other fields including dictionaries legal publications have been produced using tex has not been successful more technical fields because tex was primarily designed for mathematics when he designed tex donald knuth did not believe that single typesetting system would fit everyone's needs instead he designed many hooks inside program so that would be possible write extensions released source code hoping that publishers would design versions tailored their needs while such extensions have been created including some by knuth himself most people have extended tex only using macros has remained system associated with technical typesetting possible use tex for automatic generation sophisticated layout for xml data differences syntax between two description languages can be overcome with help texml context xml publication tex can thus be considered alternative xsl-fo tex allowed scientific papers mathematical disciplines be reduced relatively small files that could be rendered client-side allowing fully typeset scientific papers be exchanged over early internet emerging world wide web even when sending large files was difficult this paved way for creation repositories scientific papers such arxiv through which papers could be 'published'
