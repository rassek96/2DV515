hard disk hard drive fixed disk data storage device used for storing retrieving digital information using one more rigid rapidly rotating disks platters coated with magnetic material platters are paired with magnetic heads arranged on moving actuator arm which read write data platter surfaces data accessed random-access manner meaning that individual blocks data can be stored retrieved any order not only sequentially hdds are type non-volatile memory retaining stored data even when powered off introduced by ibm hdds became dominant secondary storage device for general-purpose computers by early 1960s continuously improved hdds have maintained this position into modern era servers personal computers more than companies have produced hdds historically though after extensive industry consolidation most current units are manufactured by seagate toshiba western digital hdd production bytes per year growing although unit shipments sales revenues are declining primary competing

processing computer were developed for use with general-purpose mainframe minicomputers first ibm drive ramac was approximately size two medium-sized refrigerators stored five million six-bit characters megabytes on stack disks ibm ramac disk storage unit was superseded by ibm disk storage unit which consisted platters each about 1/8-inch thick inches diameter whereas ibm used two read/write heads pneumatically actuated moving through two dimensions was one first disk storage units use array heads one per platter moving single unit cylinder-mode read/write operations were supported while heads flew about micro-inches above platter surface motion head array depended upon binary adder system hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning cabinet was about size three home refrigerators placed side by side storing equivalent about million eight-bit bytes access time was about milliseconds ibm introduced model disk drive which was about size washing machine stored two million characters on removable disk pack users could buy additional packs interchange them needed much like reels magnetic tape later models removable pack drives from ibm others became norm most computer installations reached capacities megabytes by early 1980s non-removable hdds were called fixed disk drives some high-performance hdds were manufactured with one head per track eg ibm so that no time was lost physically moving heads track known fixed-head head-per-track disk drives they were very expensive are no longer production ibm introduced new type hdd codenamed winchester its primary distinguishing feature was that disk heads were not withdrawn completely from stack disk platters when drive was powered down instead heads were allowed land on special area disk surface upon spin-down taking off again when disk was later powered on this greatly reduced cost head actuator mechanism but precluded removing just disks from drive was done with disk packs day instead first models winchester technology drives featured removable disk module which included both disk pack head assembly leaving actuator motor drive upon removal later winchester drives abandoned removable media concept returned non-removable platters like first removable pack drive first winchester drives used platters inches mm diameter few years later designers were exploring possibility that physically smaller platters might offer advantages drives with non-removable eight-inch platters appeared then drives that used 1⁄4 mm form factor mounting width equivalent that used by contemporary floppy disk drives latter were primarily intended for then-fledgling personal computer pc market 1980s began hdds were rare very expensive additional feature pcs but by late 1980s their cost had been reduced point where they were standard on all but cheapest computers most hdds early 1980s were sold pc end users external add-on subsystem subsystem was not sold under drive manufacturer's name but under subsystem manufacturer's name such corvus systems tallgrass technologies under pc system manufacturer's name such apple profile ibm pc/xt included internal mb hdd soon thereafter internal hdds proliferated on personal computers external hdds remained popular for much longer on apple macintosh many macintosh computers made between featured scsi port on back making external expansion simple older compact macintosh computers did not have user-accessible hard drive bays indeed macintosh 128k macintosh 512k macintosh plus did not feature hard drive bay at all so on those models external scsi disks were only reasonable option for expanding upon any internal storage thailand floods damaged manufacturing plants impacted hard disk drive cost adversely between driven

december platters most consumer-grade hdds spin at either rpm rpm information written read from platter rotates past devices called read-and-write heads that are positioned operate very close magnetic surface with their flying height often range tens nanometers read-and-write head used detect modify magnetization material passing immediately under modern drives there one head for each magnetic platter surface on spindle mounted on common arm actuator arm access arm moves heads on arc roughly radially across platters they spin allowing each head access almost entire surface platter spins arm moved using voice coil actuator some older designs stepper motor early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second resulting all tracks having same amount data per track but modern drives since 1990s use zone bit recording —increasing write speed from inner outer zone thereby storing more data per track outer zones modern drives small size magnetic regions creates danger that their magnetic state might be lost because thermal effects thermally induced magnetic instability which commonly known superparamagnetic limit counter this platters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers separated by 3-atom layer non-magnetic element ruthenium two layers are magnetized opposite orientation thus reinforcing each other another technology used overcome thermal effects allow greater recording densities perpendicular recording first shipped technology was used many hdds new concept was introduced allow further increase data density magnetic recording using recording media consisting coupled soft hard magnetic layers that so-called exchange spring media also known exchange coupled composite media allows good writability due write-assist nature soft layer however thermal stability determined only by hardest layer not influenced by soft layer components hdd with disks motor hub removed exposing copper colored stator coils surrounding bearing center spindle

beneath this plate moving coil often referred voice coil by analogy coil loudspeakers which attached actuator hub beneath that second nib magnet mounted on bottom plate motor some drives have only one magnet voice coil itself shaped rather like arrowhead made doubly coated copper magnet wire inner layer insulation outer thermoplastic which bonds coil together after wound on form making self-supporting portions coil along two sides arrowhead which point actuator bearing center interact with magnetic field developing tangential force that rotates actuator current flowing radially outward along one side arrowhead radially inward on other produces tangential force if magnetic field were uniform each side would generate opposing forces that would cancel each other out therefore surface magnet half north pole half south pole with radial dividing line middle causing two sides coil see opposite magnetic fields produce forces that add instead canceling currents along top bottom coil produce radial forces that do not rotate head hdd's electronics control movement actuator rotation disk perform reads writes on demand from disk controller feedback drive electronics accomplished by means special segments disk dedicated servo feedback these are either complete concentric circles case dedicated servo technology segments interspersed with real data case embedded servo technology servo feedback optimizes signal noise ratio gmr sensors by adjusting voice-coil actuated arm spinning disk also uses servo motor modern disk firmware capable scheduling reads writes efficiently on platter surfaces remapping sectors media which have failed error rates handling modern drives make extensive use error correction codes eccs particularly reed–solomon error correction these techniques store extra bits determined by mathematical formulas for each block data extra bits allow many errors be corrected invisibly extra bits themselves take up space on hdd but allow higher recording densities be employed without causing uncorrectable errors resulting much larger storage capacity for example typical tb hard disk with 512-byte sectors provides additional capacity about gb for ecc data newest drives low-density parity-check codes ldpc were supplanting reed-solomon ldpc codes enable performance close shannon limit thus provide highest storage density available typical hard disk drives attempt remap data physical sector that failing spare physical sector provided by drive's spare sector pool also called reserve pool while relying on ecc recover stored data while amount errors

density advancement slowed 10% per year during 2011–2014 due difficulty migrating from perpendicular recording newer technologies areal density inverse bit cell size so increase areal density corresponds decrease bit cell size production desktop tb hdd with four platters would have had areal density about gbit/in2 which would have amounted bit cell comprising about magnetic grains by grains since mid-2000s areal density progress has increasingly been challenged by superparamagnetic trilemma involving grain size grain magnetic strength ability head write order maintain acceptable signal noise smaller grains are required smaller grains may self-reverse thermal instability unless their magnetic strength increased but known write head materials are unable generate magnetic field sufficient write medium several new magnetic storage technologies are being developed overcome at least abate this trilemma thereby maintain competitiveness hdds with respect products such flash memory-based solid-state drives ssds seagate introduced one such technology shingled magnetic recording smr additionally smr comes with design complexities that may cause reduced write performance

10–30% achievable limit for hamr technology combination with bpr smr may be tbit/in2 which would be times higher than gbit/in2 represented by production desktop hdds hamr hdds have been delayed several years are expected they require different architecture with redesigned media read/write heads new lasers new near-field optical transducers capacity capacity hard disk drive reported by operating system end user smaller than amount stated by manufacturer which has several reasons operating system using some space use some space for data redundancy space use for file system structures difference capacity reported true si-based units vs binary prefixes can lead false impression missing capacity calculation modern hard disk drives appear their host controller contiguous set logical

functions that invoke low-level drive commands gross capacity older hdds calculated product number cylinders per recording zone number bytes per sector most commonly count zones drive some modern sata drives also report cylinder-head-sector chs capacities but these are not physical parameters because reported values are constrained by historic operating system interfaces c/h/s scheme has been replaced by logical block addressing lba simple linear addressing scheme that locates blocks by integer index which starts at lba for first block increments thereafter when using c/h/s method describe modern large drives number heads often set although typical hard disk drive has between one four platters modern hdds spare capacity for defect management not included published capacity however many early hdds certain number sectors were reserved spares thereby reducing capacity available operating system for raid subsystems data integrity fault-tolerance requirements also reduce realized capacity for example raid array has about half total capacity result data mirroring while raid array with x drives loses 1/x capacity which equals capacity single drive due storing parity information raid subsystems are multiple drives that appear be one drive more drives user but provide fault tolerance most raid vendors use checksums improve data integrity at block level some vendors design systems using hdds with sectors bytes contain bytes user data eight checksum bytes by using separate 512-byte sectors for checksum data some systems may use hidden partitions for system recovery

performance characteristics main article hard disk drive performance characteristics time access data factors that limit time access data on hdd are mostly related mechanical nature rotating disks moving heads seek time measure how long takes head assembly travel track disk that contains data rotational latency incurred because desired disk sector may not be directly under head when data transfer requested these two delays are on order milliseconds each bit rate data transfer rate once head right position creates delay which function number blocks transferred typically relatively small but can be quite long with transfer large contiguous files delay may also occur if drive disks are stopped save energy hdd's average access time its average seek time which technically time do all possible seeks divided by number all possible seeks but practice determined by statistical methods simply approximated time seek over one-third number tracks defragmentation procedure used minimize delay retrieving data by moving related items physically proximate areas on disk some computer operating systems perform defragmentation automatically although automatic defragmentation intended reduce access delays performance will be temporarily reduced while procedure progress time access data can be improved by increasing rotational speed thus reducing latency by reducing time spent seeking increasing areal density increases throughput by increasing data rate by increasing amount data under set heads thereby potentially reducing seek activity for given amount data time access data has not kept up with throughput increases which themselves have not kept up with growth bit density storage capacity seek time see also hard disk drive performance characteristics § seek time short-stroking average seek time ranges from under ms for high-end server drives ms for mobile drives with most common mobile drives at about ms most common desktop type typically being around ms first hdd had average seek time about ms by middle 1970s hdds were available with seek times about ms some early pc drives used stepper motor move heads result had seek times slow 80–120 ms but this was quickly improved by voice coil type actuation 1980s reducing seek times around ms seek time has continued improve slowly over time some desktop laptop computer systems allow user make tradeoff between seek performance drive noise faster seek rates typically require more energy usage quickly move heads across platter causing louder noises from pivot bearing greater device vibrations heads are rapidly accelerated during start seek motion decelerated at end seek motion quiet operation reduces movement speed acceleration rates but at cost reduced seek performance latency rotational speed average latency latency delay for rotation disk bring required disk sector under read-write mechanism depends on rotational speed disk measured revolutions per minute rpm average rotational latency shown table on right based on statistical relation that average latency milliseconds for such drive one-half rotational period average latency milliseconds computed divided by rotational speed rpm data transfer rate typical 7200-rpm desktop hdd has sustained disk-to-buffer data transfer rate up mbit/s this rate depends on track location rate higher for data on outer tracks where there are more data sectors per rotation lower toward inner tracks where there are fewer data sectors per rotation generally somewhat higher for 10000-rpm drives current widely used standard for buffer-to-computer interface gbit/s sata which can send about megabyte/s 10-bit encoding from buffer computer thus still comfortably ahead today's disk-to-buffer transfer rates data transfer rate read/write can be measured by writing large file disk using special file generator tools then reading back file transfer rate can be influenced by file system fragmentation layout files hdd data transfer rate depends upon rotational speed platters data recording density because heat vibration limit rotational speed advancing density becomes main method improve sequential transfer rates higher speeds require more powerful spindle motor which creates more heat while areal density advances by increasing both number tracks across disk number sectors per track only latter increases data transfer rate for given rpm

common expectation that hard disk drives designed marketed for server use will fail less frequently than consumer-grade drives usually used desktop computers however two independent studies by
