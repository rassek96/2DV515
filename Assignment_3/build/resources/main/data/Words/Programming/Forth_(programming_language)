concatenative designed by charles h moore first appeared years ago typing discipline typeless major implementations swiftforth forth inc gforth free software vfx forth microprocessor engineering influenced by burroughs large systems lisp apl influenced factor postscript rpl rebol forth imperative stack-based computer programming language environment originally designed by charles chuck moore language features include structured programming reflection ability modify program structure during program execution concatenative programming functions are composed with juxtaposition extensibility programmer can create new commands although not acronym language's name sometimes spelled with all capital letters forth following customary usage during its earlier years procedural programming language without type checking forth features both interactive execution commands making suitable shell for systems that lack more formal operating system ability compile sequences commands for later execution some forth implementations usually early versions those written be extremely portable compile threaded code but many implementations today generate optimized machine code like other language compilers forth used open firmware boot loader space applications such philae spacecraft other embedded systems which involve interaction with hardware bestselling dos game starflight from electronic arts was written with custom forth free software gforth implementation actively maintained are several commercially supported systems contents overview o stacks o maintenance history programmer's

cipher program implementations see also references further reading external links overview forth environment combines compiler with interactive shell where user defines runs subroutines called words words can be tested redefined debugged source entered without recompiling restarting whole program all syntactic elements including variables basic operators are defined words forth environments vary how resulting program stored but ideally running program has same effect manually re-entering source stacks most programming environments with recursive subroutines use stack for control flow this structure typically also stores local variables including subroutine parameters call by value system such c forth often does not have local variables however nor call-by-value instead intermediate values are kept second stack words operate directly on topmost values first stack may therefore be called parameter data stack but most often simply stack second function-call stack then called linkage return stack abbreviated rstack special rstack manipulation functions provided by kernel allow be used for temporary storage within word but otherwise cannot be used pass parameters manipulate data most words are specified terms their effect on stack typically parameters are placed on top stack before word executes after execution parameters have been erased replaced with any return values for arithmetic operators this follows rule reverse polish notation see below for examples illustrating stack usage maintenance forth simple yet extensible language its modularity extensibility permit writing high-level programs such cad systems forth has been used successfully large complex projects while applications developed by competent disciplined professionals have proven be easily maintained on evolving hardware platforms over decades use forth has niche both astronomical space applications forth still used today many embedded systems small computerized devices because its portability efficient memory use short development time fast execution speed has been implemented efficiently on modern risc processors processors that use forth machine language have been produced other uses forth include open firmware boot roms used by apple ibm sun olpc xo-1 ficl -based first stage boot controller freebsd operating system history forth evolved from charles h moore's personal programming system which had been continuous development since forth was first exposed other programmers early 1970s starting with elizabeth rather at us national radio astronomy observatory after their work at nrao charles moore elizabeth rather formed forth inc refining porting forth systems dozens other platforms next decade forth so named because file holding interpreter was labeled fourth for 4th next generation software—but ibm operating system restricted file names characters moore saw forth successor compile-link-go third-generation programming languages software for fourth generation hardware not fourth-generation programming language term has come be used because charles moore frequently moved from job job over his career early pressure on developing language was ease porting different computer architectures forth system has often been used bring up new hardware for example forth was first resident software on new intel chip macforth was first resident development system for first apple macintosh forth inc's microforth was developed for intel motorola zilog z80 microprocessors starting microforth was later used by hobbyists generate forth systems for other architectures such wide dissemination finally led standardization language common practice was codified de facto standards forth-79 forth-83 years respectively these standards were unified by ansi commonly referred ans forth forth became very popular 1980s because was well suited small microcomputers that time being compact portable at least one home computer british jupiter ace had forth its rom-resident operating system canon cat also used forth for its system programming rockwell produced single-chip microcomputers with resident forth kernels r65f11 r65f12 complete family tree at tu-wien insoft graforth was version forth with graphics expansions for apple ii asyst was forth expansion for measuring controlling on pcs programmer's perspective further information reverse polish notation forth relies heavily on explicit use data stack reverse polish notation rpn postfix notation commonly used calculators from hewlett-packard rpn operator placed after its operands opposed more common infix notation where operator placed between its operands postfix notation makes language easier parse extend forth's flexibility makes static bnf grammar inappropriate does not have monolithic compiler extending compiler only requires writing new word instead modifying grammar changing underlying implementation using rpn one could get result mathematical expression + this way + cr ok this command line first puts numbers on implied stack word multiplies two numbers on top stack replaces them with their product then number placed on stack word + adds previous product cr moves output new line only for formatting purposes could be omitted but - most implementations - without output would occur on same line input would be less readable example finally command prints result user's terminal everything has completed successfully at that point text interpreter then outputs prompt ok moves new line get more input without needing anything explicit do that even forth's structural features are stack-based for example floor5 n -- n' dup hello world word cr carriage return causes following output be displayed on new line parsing word dot-quote reads double-quote delimited string appends code current definition so that parsed string will be displayed on execution space character separating word from string hello world not included part string needed so that parser recognizes forth word standard forth system also interpreter same output can be obtained by typing following code fragment into forth console cr hello world dot-paren immediate word that parses parenthesis-delimited string displays with word space character separating from hello world not part string word cr comes before text print by convention forth interpreter does not start output on new line also by convention interpreter waits for input at end previous line after ok prompt there no implied flush-buffer action forth's cr sometimes other programming languages mixing states compiling interpreting here definition word emit-q which when executed emits single character q emit-q ascii value for character 'q' emit this definition was written use ascii value q character directly text between parentheses comment ignored by compiler word emit takes value from data stack displays corresponding character following redefinition emit-q uses words right-bracket char literal temporarily switch interpreter state calculate ascii value q character return compilation state append calculated value current colon definition emit-q literal emit parsing word char takes space-delimited word parameter places value its first character on data stack word immediate version char using example definition for emit-q could be rewritten like this emit-q q emit \ emit single character 'q' this definition used \ backslash for describing comment both char are predefined ans forth using immediate postpone could have been defined like this char postpone literal immediate complete rc4 cipher
