manchester mark from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search this article about early british computer for aircraft see avro manchester avro manchester manchester mark was one world's first stored-program computers manchester mark was one earliest stored-program computers developed at victoria university manchester from small-scale experimental machine ssem baby operational june was also called manchester automatic digital machine madm work began august first version was operational by april program written search for mersenne primes ran error-free for nine hours on night 16/17 june machine's successful operation was widely reported british press which used phrase electronic brain describing their readers that description provoked reaction from head university manchester's department neurosurgery start long-running debate whether electronic computer could ever be truly creative mark was provide computing resource within university allow researchers gain experience practical use computers but very quickly also became prototype on which design ferranti's commercial version could be based development ceased at end machine was scrapped towards end replaced february by ferranti mark world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer computer especially historically significant because its pioneering inclusion index registers innovation which made easier for program read sequentially through array words memory thirty-four patents resulted from machine's development many ideas behind its design were incorporated subsequent commercial products such ibm well ferranti mark chief designers frederic c williams tom kilburn concluded from their experiences with mark that computers would be used more scientific roles than pure mathematics they started development work on meg mark 1's successor which would include floating point unit contents background development design programming first programs later developments cultural impact see also references further reading external links background main article history computing hardware mathematician alan turing published definition theoretical universal computing machine computer which held its program on tape along with data being worked on turing proved that such machine was capable solving any conceivable mathematical problem for which algorithm could be written during 1940s turing others such konrad zuse developed idea using computer's own memory hold both program data instead tape but was mathematician john von neumann who became widely credited with defining that stored-program computer architecture on which manchester mark was based practical construction von neumann computer depended on availability suitable memory device university manchester's small-scale experimental machine ssem world's first stored-program computer had successfully demonstrated practicality stored-program approach williams tube early form computer memory based on standard cathode ray tube crt by running its first program june early electronic computers were generally programmed by being rewired via plugs patch panels there was no separate program stored memory modern computer could take several days reprogram eniac for instance stored-program computers were also being developed by other researchers notably national physical laboratory's pilot ace cambridge university's edsac us army's edvac ssem mark differed primarily their use williams tubes memory devices instead mercury delay lines from about august ssem was intensively developed prototype for manchester mark initially with aim providing university with more realistic computing facility october uk government chief scientist ben lockspeiser was given demonstration prototype mark while on visit university manchester lockspeiser was so impressed by what he saw that he immediately initiated government contract with local firm ferranti make commercial version machine ferranti mark his letter company dated october lockspeiser authorised company proceed on lines we discussed namely construct electronic calculating machine instructions professor f c williams from that point on development mark had additional purpose supplying ferranti with design on which base their commercial machine government's contract with ferranti ran for five years from november involved estimated £35000 per year development design functional schematic showing williams tubes green tube c holds current instruction its address accumulator m used hold multiplicand multiplier for multiply operation b contains index registers used modify instructions ssem had been designed by team frederic c williams tom kilburn geoff tootill develop mark they were joined by two research students d b g edwards g e thomas work began earnest august project soon had dual purpose supplying ferranti with working design on which they could base commercial machine ferranti mark building computer that would allow researchers gain experience how such machine could be used practice first two versions manchester mark – known intermediary version – was operational by april however this first version lacked features such instructions necessary programmatically transfer data between main store its newly developed magnetic backing store which had be done by halting machine manually initiating transfer these missing features were incorporated final specification version which was fully working by october machine contained valves had power consumption kilowatts increase reliability purpose-built crts made by gec were used machine instead standard devices used ssem ssem's 32-bit word length was increased bits each word could hold either one 40-bit number two 20-bit program instructions main store initially consisted two double-density williams tubes each holding two arrays x 40-bit words – known pages – backed up by magnetic drum capable storing additional pages capacity was increased final specification version eight pages main store on four williams tubes magnetic drum pages backing store 12-inch mm diameter drum initially known magnetic wheel contained series parallel magnetic tracks around its surface each with its own read/write head each track held bits corresponding two pages 2×32×40 bits one revolution drum took milliseconds during which time both pages could be transferred crt main memory although actual data transfer time depended on latency time took for page arrive under read/write head writing pages drum took about twice long reading drum's rotational speed was synchronised main central processor clock which allowed for additional drums be added data was recorded onto drum using phase modulation technique still known today manchester coding machine's instruction set was increased from ssem initially including multiplication done hardware this increased instructions final specification version ten bits each word were allocated hold instruction code standard instruction time was milliseconds but multiplication was much slower depending on size operand machine's most significant innovation generally considered be its incorporation index registers commonplace on modern computers ssem had included two registers implemented williams tubes accumulator program counter c c had already been assigned tube holding two index registers originally known b-lines was given name b contents registers could be used modify program instructions allowing convenient iteration through array numbers stored memory mark also had fourth tube m hold multiplicand multiplier for multiplication operation programming section punched tape showing how one 40-bit word was encoded eight 5-bit characters bits allocated for each program instruction were used hold instruction code which allowed for different instructions machine had initially increasing when function codes programmatically control data transfer between magnetic drum cathode ray tube crt main store were added on intermediary version programs were input by key switches output was displayed series dots dashes on cathode ray tube known output device just on ssem from which mark had been developed however final specification machine completed october benefitted from addition teleprinter with 5-hole paper-tape reader punch mathematician alan turing who had been appointed nominal post deputy director computing machine laboratory at university manchester september devised base encoding scheme based on standard ita2 5-bit teleprinter code which allowed programs data be written read from paper tape ita2 system maps each possible binary values that can be represented bits single character thus represents d represents z so forth turing changed only few standard encodings for instance which mean no effect linefeed teleprinter code were represented by characters / @ respectively binary zero represented by forward slash was most common character programs data leading sequences written /////////////// one early user suggested that turing's choice forward slash was subconscious choice on his part representation rain seen through dirty window reflecting manchester's famously dismal weather because mark had 40-bit word length eight 5-bit teleprinter characters were required encode each word thus for example binary word would be represented on paper tape zdslzwrf contents any word store could also be set via teleprinter's keyboard output onto its printer machine worked internally binary but was able carry out necessary decimal binary binary decimal conversions for its input output respectively there was no assembly language defined for mark programs had be written submitted binary form encoded eight 5-bit characters for each 40-bit word programmers were encouraged memorize modified ita2 coding scheme make their job easier data was read written from papertape punch under program control mark had no system hardware interrupts program continued after read write operation had been initiated until another input/output instruction was encountered at which point machine waited for first complete mark had no operating system its only system software was few basic routines for input output ssem from which was developed contrast established mathematical convention machine's storage was arranged with least significant digits left thus one was represented five bits rather than more conventional negative numbers were represented using two's complement most computers still do today that representation value most significant bit denotes sign number positive numbers have zero that position negative numbers one thus range numbers that could be held each 40-bit word was −239 − decimal first programs first realistic program be run on mark was search for mersenne primes early april which ran error free for nine hours on night 16/17 june algorithm was specified by max newman head mathematics department at university manchester program was written by kilburn tootill turing later wrote optimised version program dubbed mersenne express manchester mark continued do useful mathematical work until including investigation riemann hypothesis calculations optics later developments main article manchester computers tootill was temporarily transferred from university manchester ferranti august continue work on ferranti mark 1's design spent four months working with company manchester mark was dismantled scrapped towards end replaced few months later by first ferranti mark world's first commercially available general-purpose computer between average size design team working on mark its predecessor ssem had been about four people during that time patents were taken out based on team's work either by ministry supply by its successor national research development corporation july ibm invited williams united states on all-expenses-paid trip discuss mark 1's design company subsequently licensed several patented ideas developed for machine including williams tube design its own computers most significant design legacy manchester mark was perhaps its incorporation index registers patent for which was taken out names williams kilburn tootill newman kilburn williams concluded that computers would be used more scientific roles than pure maths decided develop new machine that would include floating point unit work began resulting machine which ran its first program may was known meg megacycle machine was smaller simpler than mark much faster for maths problems ferranti produced version meg with williams tubes replaced by more reliable core memory marketed ferranti mercury cultural impact see also history artificial intelligence successful operation manchester mark its predecessor ssem was widely reported british press which used phrase electronic brain describe machines lord louis mountbatten had earlier introduced that term speech delivered british institution radio engineers on october which he speculated about how primitive computers then available might evolve excitement surrounding reporting what was first recognisably modern computer provoked reaction unexpected by its developers sir geoffrey jefferson professor neurosurgery at university manchester on being asked deliver lister oration on june chose mind mechanical man his subject his purpose was debunk manchester project his address he said not until machine can write sonnet compose concerto because thoughts emotions felt not by chance fall symbols could we agree that machine equals brain – that not only write but know that had written no machine could feel pleasure at its success grief when its valves fuse be warmed by flattery be made miserable by its mistakes be charmed by sex be angry miserable when cannot get what wants times reported on jefferson's speech following day adding that jefferson forecast that day would never dawn when gracious rooms royal society would be converted into garages house these new fellows this was interpreted deliberate slight newman who had secured grant from society continue work manchester team response newman wrote follow-up article for times which he claimed that there was close analogy between structure mark human brain his article included interview with turing who added this only foretaste what come only shadow what going be we have have some experience with machine before we really know its capabilities may take years before we settle down new possibilities but i do not see why should not enter any fields normally covered by human intellect eventually compete on
