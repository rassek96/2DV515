troff from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search this article about unix document processing system for command basic see troff not be confused with trough disambiguation troff /ˈtiːrɒf/ major component document processing system developed by at&t corporation for unix operating system troff features commands designate fonts spacing paragraphs margins footnotes more unlike many other text formatters troff can position characters arbitrarily on page even overlapping them has fully programmable input language separate preprocessors are used for more convenient production tables diagrams mathematics inputs troff are plain text files that can be created by any text editor extensive macro packages have been created for various document styles typical distribution troff includes me macros for formatting research papers man mdoc macros for creating unix man pages mv macros for creating mountable transparencies ms mm macros for letters books technical memoranda reports contents history preprocessors reimplementations see also references external links history troff can trace its origins back text-formatting program called runoff written by jerome h saltzer for mit's ctss operating system mid-1960s name allegedly came from phrase i'll run off document bob morris ported ge architecture called program roff abbreviation runoff was rewritten rf for pdp-7 at same time doug mcilroy rewrote extended simplified version roff bcpl programming language first version unix was developed on pdp-7 which was sitting around bell labs developers wanted get pdp-11 for further work on operating system order justify cost for this system they proposed that they would implement document-formatting system for at&t patents division this first formatting program was reimplementation mcillroy's roff written by joe f ossanna when they needed more flexible language new version roff called nroff newer roff was written which provided basis for all future versions when they got graphic systems cat phototypesetter ossanna modified nroff support multiple fonts proportional spacing dubbed troff for typesetter roff its sophisticated output amazed typesetter manufacturer confused peer reviewers who thought that manuscripts using troff had been published before such name troff pronounced /ˈtiːrɒf/ rather than /ˈtrɒf/ with troff came nroff they were actually almost same program which was for producing output for line printers character terminals understood everything troff did ignored commands which were not applicable eg font changes ossanna's troff was written pdp-11 assembly language produced output specifically for cat phototypesetter he rewrote c although was now lines uncommented code still dependent on cat cat became less common was no longer supported by manufacturer need make support other devices became priority ossanna died before this task was completed so brian kernighan took on task rewriting troff newly rewritten version produced device-independent code which was very easy for post-processors read translate appropriate printer codes also this new version troff often called ditroff for device independent troff had several extensions which included drawing functions program's documentation defines output format ditroff which used by many modern troff clones like gnu groff troff collection tools including pre- post-processors was eventually called documenter's workbench dwb was under continuous development bell labs later at spin-off unix system laboratories usl through at that time softquad took over maintenance although brian kernighan continued improve troff on his own thus there are at least following variants original bell labs troff use softquad dwb based on usl dwb from dwb from lucent software solutions formerly usl troff plan edition while troff has been supplanted by other programs such interleaf framemaker latex still being used quite extensively remains default formatter for unix documentation software was reimplemented groff for gnu system beginning addition due open sourcing ancient unix systems well modern successors such ditroff based open-sourced versions found on opensolaris plan from bell labs there are several versions at&t troff cat ditroff-based available under various open-source licenses preprocessors troff evolved since there are several things which cannot be done easily troff several preprocessors were developed these programs transform certain parts document into troff input fitting naturally into use pipelines unix — sending output one program input another see pipes filters typically each preprocessor translates only sections input file that are specially marked passing rest file through unchanged embedded preprocessing instructions are written simple application-specific programming language which provides high degree power flexibility eqn preprocessor allows mathematical formulae be specified simple intuitive manner tbl preprocessor for formatting tables refer similar program bib processes citations document according bibliographic database three preprocessors provide troff with drawing capabilities by defining domain-specific language for describing picture pic procedural programming language providing various drawing functions like circle box ideal allows drawing pictures declaratively deriving picture by solving system simultaneous equations based on vectors transformations described by its input grn describes pictures through graphical elements drawn at absolute coordinates based on gremlin file format defined by early graphics workstation yet more preprocessors allow drawing more complex pictures by generating output for pic grap draws charts like scatter plots histograms chem draws chemical structure diagrams dformat draws record-based data structures reimplementations groff gnu project's free replacement for troff nroff unroff extensible replacement troff written scheme heirloom troff based on troff from opensolaris includes support for opentype fonts improved support for type fonts support for unicode new paragraph formatting algorithm groff compatibility mode mandoc specialised compiler/formatter only for man mdoc macro packages neatroff new troff implementation including support for advanced font features bi-directional text see also desktop publishing docbook groff gnu
