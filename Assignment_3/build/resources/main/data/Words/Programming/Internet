individual networks at various levels scope end-users who only access internet when needed perform function obtain information represent bottom routing hierarchy at top routing hierarchy are tier networks large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via peering agreements tier lower level networks buy internet transit from other providers reach at least some parties on global internet though they may also engage peering isp may use single upstream provider for connectivity implement multihoming achieve redundancy load balancing internet exchange points are major traffic exchanges with physical connections multiple isps large organizations such academic institutions large enterprises governments may perform same function isps engaging peering

internet ip routing structure hypertext links world wide web are examples scale-free networks computers routers use routing tables their operating system direct ip packets next-hop router destination routing tables are maintained by manual configuration automatically by routing protocols end-nodes typically use default route that points toward isp providing transit while isp routers use border gateway protocol establish most efficient routing across complex connections global internet access common methods internet access by users include dial-up with computer modem via telephone circuits broadband over coaxial cable fiber optics copper wires wi-fi satellite cellular telephone technology 3g 4g internet may often be accessed from computers libraries internet cafes internet access points exist many public places such airport halls coffee shops various terms are used such public internet kiosk public access terminal web payphone many hotels also have public terminals though these are usually fee-based these terminals are widely accessed for various usages such ticket booking bank deposit online payment wi-fi provides wireless access internet via local computer networks hotspots providing such access include wi-fi cafes where users need bring their own wireless devices such laptop pda these services may be free all free customers only fee-based grassroots efforts have led wireless community networks commercial wi-fi services covering large city areas are place new york london vienna toronto san francisco philadelphia chicago pittsburgh internet can then be accessed from such places park bench apart from wi-fi there have been experiments with proprietary mobile wireless networks like ricochet various high-speed data services over cellular phone networks fixed

contributions standards are published request for comments rfc documents on ietf web site principal methods networking that enable internet are contained specially designated rfcs that constitute internet standards other less rigorous documents are simply informative experimental historical document best current practices bcp when implementing internet technologies internet standards describe framework known internet protocol suite this model architecture that divides methods into layered system protocols originally documented rfc rfc layers correspond environment scope which their services operate at top application layer space for application-specific networking methods used software applications for example web browser program uses client-server application model specific protocol interaction between servers clients while many file-sharing systems use peer-to-peer paradigm below this top layer transport layer connects applications on different hosts with logical channel through network with appropriate data exchange methods underlying these layers are networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders exchange traffic across them internet layer enables computers identify locate each other via internet protocol ip addresses routes their traffic via intermediate transit networks last at bottom architecture link layer which provides logical connectivity between hosts on same network link such local area network lan dial-up connection model also known tcp/ip designed be independent underlying hardware used for physical connections which model does not concern itself with any detail other models have been developed such osi model that attempt be comprehensive every aspect communications while many similarities exist between models they are not compatible details description implementation yet tcp/ip protocols are usually included discussion osi networking user data processed through protocol stack each abstraction layer adds encapsulation information at sending host data transmitted over wire at link level between hosts routers encapsulation removed by receiving host intermediate relays update link encapsulation at each hop inspect ip layer for routing purposes most prominent component internet model internet protocol ip which provides addressing systems including ip addresses for computers on network ip enables internetworking essence establishes internet itself internet protocol version ipv4 initial version used on first generation internet still dominant use was designed address up ~43 billion hosts however explosive growth internet has led ipv4 address exhaustion which entered its final stage when global address allocation pool was exhausted new protocol version ipv6 was developed mid-1990s which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities more efficient routing internet traffic ipv6 currently growing deployment around world since internet address registries rirs began urge all resource managers plan rapid adoption conversion ipv6 not directly interoperable by design with ipv4 essence establishes parallel version internet not directly accessible with ipv4 software thus translation facilities must exist for internetworking nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions internet protocol network infrastructure however has been lagging this development aside from complex array physical connections that make up its infrastructure internet facilitated by bi- multi-lateral commercial contracts eg peering agreements by technical specifications protocols that describe exchange data over network indeed internet defined by its interconnections routing policies services

telephony another common communications service made possible by creation internet voip stands for voice-over-internet protocol referring protocol that underlies all internet communication idea began early 1990s with walkie-talkie-like voice applications for personal computers recent years many voip systems have become easy use convenient normal telephone benefit that internet carries voice traffic voip can be free cost much less than traditional telephone call especially over long distances especially for those with always-on internet connections such cable adsl voip maturing into competitive alternative traditional telephone service interoperability between different providers has improved ability call receive call from traditional telephone available simple inexpensive voip network adapters are available that eliminate need for personal computer voice quality can still vary from call call but often equal can even exceed that traditional calls remaining problems for voip include emergency telephone number dialing reliability currently few voip providers provide emergency service but not universally available older traditional phones with no extra features may be line-powered only operate during power failure voip can never do so without backup power source for phone equipment internet access devices voip has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications form communication between players popular voip clients for gaming include ventrilo teamspeak modern video game consoles also offer voip chat features data transfer file sharing example transferring large amounts data across internet computer file can be emailed customers colleagues friends attachment can be uploaded website file transfer protocol ftp server for easy download by others can be put into shared location onto file server for instant use by colleagues load bulk downloads many users can be eased by use mirror servers peer-to-peer networks any these cases access file may be controlled by user authentication transit file over internet may be obscured by encryption money may change hands for access file price can be paid by remote charging funds from for
