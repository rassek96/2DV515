type-in program from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search type-in program type-in game just type-in computer program listing source code printed computer magazine book meant be typed on computer's keyboard by reader order run program type-ins were very common early home computer era late 1970s early 1980s because period's lack inexpensive portable storage media low penetration modems bulletin board systems relatively short maximum length for program's code on home computer with main memory few tens kilobytes type-ins were often seen useful for learning programming allowing users begin their programming efforts by porting program written for one system for use on another description here example type-in listing print hello world goto use this type-in reader would take printed copy program listing such from magazine book sit down at computer manually enter two lines code listing heading not part code computers this era automatically booted into programming environment – even commands load run prepackaged program were really programming commands executed direct mode after typing program user would be able run also save disk cassette for future use users were often cautioned save program before running errors could result crash requiring reboot which would render program irretrievable unless had been saved simple program displayed above trivial example - many type-ins were fully functional games application software sometimes rivaling commercial packages type-ins were usually written basic combination basic loader machine language latter case opcodes operands machine language part were often simply given data statements within basic program were loaded using poke loop since few users had access assembler some cases special program for entering machine language numerically was provided programs with machine language component sometimes included assembly language listings for users who had assemblers who were interested internal workings program downside type-ins was labor work required enter medium-sized type-in was on order hours if resulting program turned out not be user's taste was quite possible that user spent more time keying program than using additionally type-ins were error-prone both for users for magazines this was especially true machine language parts basic programs which were nothing but line after line data statements some cases where version ascii used on type computer program was published for included printable characters for each value from 0–255 code could have been printed using strings that contained glyphs that values mapped mnemonic such instructing user which keys press while basic program would often stop with error at incorrect statement machine language parts program could fail untraceable ways this made correct entry programs difficult counter difficulty keying type-in mikbug machine code monitor for motorola late 1970s incorporated checksum into its hexadecimal program listings later some magazines developed checksum programs their own there were many different styles checksum program usually depending on type program being entered on complexity checksummer checksummers were proprietary were generally printed every issue magazine most basic distinction was whether checksummer was run only once when program had been completely keyed whether was used interactively former type either read typed-in computer code off disk read directly from memory this type checksummer was usually manually appended end basic program checksum program would print checksum for each line code magazine would print correct checksums adjacent listing user would compare two catch errors more advanced checksum programs were used interactively they would take line code was entered immediately produce checksum which could be compared printed listing users however had enter checksum programs themselves correctly example hexadecimal mlx type-in program code printed compute's gazette magazine for example compute compute's gazette printed basic listings for automatic proofreader verify lines basic mlx for binary data each issue that carried type-in programs these formats once user had typed automatic proofreader correctly he had bootstrapped his way verifying mlx other programs beyond manual labor type-ins was not uncommon for certain magazines print poor quality listings presenting reader with nearly illegible characters especially case where machine-code data was printed using extended ascii glyphs instead data statements this typically happened when transferring list output from era's ubiquitous 7–8-pin dot-matrix printers directly printing presses – sometimes even without prettyprinting this was particularly troublesome listings which contained graphical characters representing control codes used for eg cursor movements such characters tended be less legible than alphanumeric ones first place additional issues arose after advent basics that did not require line numbers magazine broke logical lines across physical lines due space constraints without line numbers distinction was not always apparent compute even for time used handwritten arrow represent carriage return its program listings course some errors type-ins were result programmer error were simply bugs program magazines often issued errata notices correct bad listings subsequent issues other solutions existed for tedium typing seemingly-endless lines code freelance authors wrote most magazine type-in programs accompanying article often provided readers mailing address send small sum us$3 was typical buy program on disk tape by mid-1980s recognising this demand from readers many us-published magazines offered all each issue's type-ins on optional disk often with bonus program two some these disks became electronic publications their own right outlasting their parent magazine happened with loadstar some uk magazines occasionally offered free evatone that played on vinyl record player connected microcomputer's cassette input other input methods such cauzin softstrip were tried without much success not all type-ins were long run magazine's popular magic column specialized one-liner programs for commodore these programs were often graphic demos meant illustrate technical quirk computer's architecture text accompanying graphics demo programs would avoid explicitly describing resultant image enticing reader type history type-in programs preceded dawn home computer era david h ahl wrote while education product line manager at digital equipment corp i put out call for games educational institutions throughout north america i was overwhelmed with response i selected best games put them together book basic computer games after putting book together on my own time i convinced reluctant managers at dec publish they were convinced wouldn't sell plus its sequel more basic computer games have sold over half million copies proving that people are intrigued by computer games most early computer magazines published type-in programs professional business-oriented journals such byte popular computing printed them less frequently often test program illustrate technical topic covered magazine rather than application for general use consumer-oriented publications such compute family computing ran several each issue programs were sometimes specific given home computer sometimes compatible with several computers entirely platform-specific magazines such compute's gazette commodore antic atari since they only had print one version each program were able print more longer listings many type programs were public domain software like many games basic computer games authors often encouraged users modify them adding capabilities otherwise changing them suit their needs many authors used article accompanying type-ins suggest modifications for reader programmer perform users would sometimes send their changes back into magazine for later publication this could be considered predecessor open source software but today most open source licenses specify that code be available machine readable format antic stated that its staff spends good portion our time diligently combing incoming submissions for practical application programs we receive lot disk directory programs recipe file storers mini word processors other rehashed versions old ideas while most type-ins were simple games utilities likely only hold user's interest for short time some were very ambitious rivaling commercial software perhaps most famous example type-in word processor speedscript published by compute's gazette compute for several 8-bit computers starting compute also published speedscript along with some accessory programs book form retained following into next decade users refined added capabilities compute discontinued type-in programs may stating computers software have grown more powerful we've realized it's not possible offer top quality type-in programs for all machines we also realize that you're less inclined type those programs cost cassette tapes floppy disks declined sophistication commercial programs technical capabilities computers they ran on steadily increased importance type-in declined europe magazine cover tapes/disks became common type-ins became virtually non-existent north america type-ins remained popular for 8-bit computers well into 1990s although type-ins for 16/32-bit computers quickly faded some programming technical magazines continued print short code snippets for instruction purposes from time time but these 10–20-line segments would not be considered type-in programs proper sense although type-in programs have disappeared today tradition distributing software with magazines lived on especially europe with 3½ floppy disks included with magazines throughout most 1990s eventually followed by cd-roms dvds see also speedscript micro adventure laser chess notes listings for bbc micro acorn electron whose basic rom included assembler were generally presented assembly code providing somewhat better chance catching errors making easier for knowledgeable users modify program ahoy magazine was also notable for printing assembly code listings even though covered commodore platform which did not include assembler example sometimes
