for explanations sentences forms nlp document which actually computer program natural languages natural language user interfaces include inform7 natural programming language for making interactive fiction shakespeare esoteric natural programming language style plays william shakespeare wolfram alpha computational knowledge engine using natural language input contents interpretation software paradigm publication value nlp programs documents contribution nlp programs machine knowledge see also bibliography references external links interpretation smallest unit statement nlp sentence each sentence stated terms concepts from underlying ontology attributes that ontology named objects capital letters nlp text every sentence unambiguously compiles into procedure call underlying high-level programming language such matlab octave scilab python etc symbolic languages such mathematica are capable interpreted processing queries by sentences this can allow interactive requests such that implemented wolfram alpha difference between these nlp that latter builds up single program library routines that are programmed through natural language sentences using ontology that defines available data structures high level programming language example text from english language nlp program senglish follows if u 'smc01-control' then do following define surface weights alpha initialise matrix phi 'unit matrix' define j 'inertia matrix' spc01 compute matrix j2 inverse j compute position velocity error ve angular velocity error oe from dynamical state x guidance reference xnow define joint sliding surface g2 from position velocity error ve angular velocity error oe using surface weights alpha compute smoothed sign function sg2 from joint sliding surface g2 with sign threshold compute special dynamical force f from dynamical state x surface weights alpha compute control torque t control force u from matrix j2 surface weights alpha special dynamical force f smoothed sign function sg2 finish conditional actions that defines feedback control scheme using sliding mode control method software paradigm natural language programming top down method writing software its stages are follows definition ontology - taxonomy - concepts needed describe tasks topic addressed each concept all their attributes are defined natural language words this ontology will define data structures nlp can use sentences definition one more top level sentences terms concepts from ontology these sentences are later used invoke most important activities topic defining each top level sentences terms sequence sentences defining each lower level sentences terms other sentences by simple sentence form execute code where stands for code terms associated high level programming language repeating previous step until you have no sentences left undefined during this process each sentences can be classified belong section document be produced html latex format form final nlp program testing meaning each sentence by executing its code using testing objects providing library procedure calls underlying high level language which are needed code definitions some low-level-sentence meanings providing title author data compiling sentences into html latex file publishing nlp program webpage on internet pdf file compiled from latex document publication value nlp programs documents nlp program precise formal description some procedure that its author created human readable can also be read by suitable software agent for example web page nlp format can be read by software personal assistant agent person she he can ask agent execute some sentences ie carry out some task answer question there reader agent available for english interpretation html based nlp documents that person can run on her personal computer contribution nlp programs machine knowledge ontology class natural language program that not concept sense humans use concepts concepts nlp are examples samples generic human concepts each sentence nlp program either stating relationship world model carries out action environment carries out computational procedure invokes answering mechanism response question set nlp sentences with associated ontology defined can also be used pseudo code that does not provide details any underlying high level programming language such application sentences used become high level abstractions conceptualisations computing procedures that are computer language machine independent see also attempto controlled english natural language processing knowledge
