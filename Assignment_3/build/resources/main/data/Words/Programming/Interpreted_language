which most its implementations execute instructions directly without previously compiling program into machine-language instructions interpreter executes program directly translating each statement into sequence one more subroutines already compiled into machine code terms interpreted language compiled language are not well defined because theory any programming language can be either interpreted compiled modern programming language implementation increasingly popular for platform provide both options interpreted languages can also be contrasted with machine languages functionally both execution interpretation mean same thing — fetching next instruction/statement from program executing although interpreted byte code additionally identical machine code form has assembler representation term interpreted practically reserved for software processed languages by virtual machine emulator on top native ie hardware processor principle programs many languages may be compiled interpreted emulated executed natively so this designation applied solely based on common implementation practice rather than representing essential property language many languages have been implemented using both compilers interpreters including basic c lisp pascal python java c are compiled into bytecode virtual machine-friendly interpreted language lisp implementations can freely mix interpreted compiled code contents historical background advantages interpreting language disadvantages interpreted languages list frequently used interpreted languages o languages usually compiled bytecode see also references historical background early days computing language design was heavily influenced by decision use compiling interpreting mode execution for example smalltalk which was designed be interpreted at run-time allows generic objects dynamically interact with each other initially interpreted languages were compiled line-by-line that each line was compiled was about be executed if loop subroutine caused certain lines be executed multiple times they would be recompiled every time this has become much less common most so-called interpreted languages use intermediate representation which combines compiling interpreting examples include java python ruby similarly uses abstract syntax tree intermediate representation forth intermediate representation can be compiled once for all java each time before execution perl ruby each time change source detected before execution python advantages interpreting language interpreting language gives implementations some additional flexibility over compiled implementations features that are often easier implement interpreters than compilers include platform independence java's byte code for example reflection reflective use evaluator eg first-order eval function dynamic typing smaller executable program size since implementations have flexibility choose instruction code dynamic scoping furthermore source code can be read copied giving users more freedom disadvantages interpreted languages disadvantages interpreted languages are without static type-checking which usually performed by compiler programs can be less reliable because type checking eliminates class programming errors interpreters can be susceptible code injection attacks slower execution compared direct native machine code execution on host cpu technique used improve performance just-in-time compilation which converts frequently executed sequences interpreted instruction host machine code jit most often combined with compilation byte-code java source code can be read copied eg javascript web pages more easily reverse engineered through reflection applications where intellectual property has commercial advantage some cases obfuscation can be used encrypt source code obscure its purpose list frequently used interpreted languages apl vector oriented language using unusual character set o j apl variant which tacit
