general-purpose interpreted dynamic programming language its design philosophy emphasizes code readability its syntax allows programmers express concepts fewer lines code than possible languages such c++ java language provides constructs intended enable writing clear programs on both small large scale python supports multiple programming paradigms including object-oriented imperative functional programming procedural styles features dynamic type system automatic memory management has large comprehensive standard library python interpreters are available for many operating systems allowing python code run on wide variety systems cpython reference implementation python free open-source software has community-based development model do nearly all its variant implementations cpython

development environments implementations development naming uses languages influenced by python see also references further reading external links history guido van rossum creator python main article history python python was conceived late 1980s its implementation began december by guido van rossum at centrum wiskunde & informatica cwi netherlands successor abc language itself inspired by setl capable exception handling interfacing with operating system amoeba van rossum python's principal author his continuing central role deciding direction python reflected title given him by python community benevolent dictator for life bdfl about origin python van rossum wrote over six years ago december i was looking for hobby programming project that would keep me occupied during week around christmas my office would be closed but i had home computer not much else on my hands i decided write interpreter for new scripting language i had been thinking about lately descendant abc that would appeal unix/c hackers i chose python working title for project being slightly irreverent mood big fan monty python's flying circus python was released on october had many major new features including cycle-detecting garbage collector support for unicode with this release development process was changed became more transparent community-backed python which early its development was commonly referred python py3k major backwards-incompatible release was released on december after long period testing many its major features have been backported backwards-compatible python 26x 27x version series features philosophy python multi-paradigm programming language object-oriented programming structured programming are fully supported many language features support functional programming aspect-oriented programming including by metaprogramming metaobjects magic methods many other paradigms are supported via extensions including design by contract logic programming python uses dynamic typing mix reference counting cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management important feature python dynamic name resolution late binding which binds method variable names during program execution design python offers some support for functional programming lisp tradition language has map reduce filter functions list comprehensions dictionaries sets generator expressions standard library has two modules itertools functools that implement functional tools borrowed from haskell standard ml core philosophy language summarized by document zen python pep which includes aphorisms such beautiful better than ugly explicit better than implicit simple better than complex complex better than complicated readability counts rather than requiring all desired functionality be built into language's core python was designed be highly extensible python can also be embedded existing applications that need programmable interface this design small core language with large standard library easily extensible interpreter was intended by van rossum from start because his frustrations with abc which espoused opposite mindset while offering choice coding methodology python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax such perl favor sparser less-cluttered grammar alex martelli put describe something clever not considered compliment python culture python's philosophy rejects perl there more than one way do approach language design favor there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way do python's developers strive avoid premature optimization moreover reject patches non-critical parts cpython that would offer marginal increase speed at cost clarity when speed important python programmer can move time-critical functions extension modules written languages such c try using pypy just-in-time compiler cython also available which translates python script into c makes direct c-level api calls into python interpreter important goal python's developers making fun use this reflected origin name which comes from monty python occasionally playful approach tutorials reference materials such using examples that refer spam eggs instead standard foo bar common neologism python community pythonic which can have wide range meanings related program style say that code pythonic say that uses python idioms well that natural shows fluency language that conforms with python's minimalist philosophy emphasis on readability contrast code that difficult understand reads like rough transcription from another programming language called unpythonic users admirers python especially those considered knowledgeable experienced are often referred pythonists pythonistas pythoneers syntax semantics main article python syntax semantics python intended be highly readable language designed have uncluttered visual layout often using english keywords where other languages use punctuation further python has fewer syntactic exceptions special cases than c pascal indentation main article python syntax semantics § indentation python uses whitespace indentation delimit blocks - rather than curly braces keywords increase indentation comes after certain statements decrease indentation signifies end current block this feature also sometimes termed off-side rule statements control flow python's statements include among others assignment statement token '=' equals sign this operates differently than traditional imperative programming languages this fundamental mechanism including nature python's version variables illuminates many other features language assignment c eg x = translates typed variable name x receives copy numeric value right-hand value copied into allocated storage location for which left-hand variable name symbolic address memory allocated variable large enough potentially quite large for declared type simplest case python assignment using same example x = translates generic name x receives reference separate dynamically allocated object numeric int type value this termed binding name object since name's storage location doesn't contain indicated value improper call variable names may be subsequently rebound at any time objects greatly varying types including strings procedures complex objects with data methods etc successive assignments common value multiple names eg x = y = z = result allocating storage at most three names one numeric object which all three names are bound since name generic reference holder unreasonable associate fixed data type with however at given time name will be bound some object which will have type thus there dynamic typing if statement which conditionally executes block code along with else elif contraction else-if for statement which iterates over iterable object capturing each element local variable for use by attached block while statement which executes block code long its condition true try statement which allows exceptions raised its attached code block be caught handled by except clauses also ensures that clean-up code finally block will always be run regardless how block exits class statement which executes block code attaches its local namespace class for use object-oriented programming def statement which defines function method with statement from python which encloses code block within context manager for example acquiring lock before block code run releasing lock afterwards opening file then closing allowing resource acquisition initialization raii-like behavior pass statement which serves nop syntactically needed create empty code block assert statement used during debugging check for conditions that ought apply yield statement which returns value from generator function from python yield also operator this form used implement coroutines import statement which used import modules whose functions variables can be used current program print statement was changed print function python python does not support tail call optimization first-class continuations according guido van rossum never will however better support for coroutine-like functionality provided by extending python's generators before generators were lazy iterators information was passed unidirectionally out generator python possible pass information back into generator function python information can be passed through multiple stack levels expressions some python expressions are similar languages such c java while some are not addition subtraction multiplication are same but behavior division differs see mathematics for details python also added operator for exponentiation python supports matrix multiplication directly with @ operator versus c java which implement these library functions earlier versions python also used methods instead infix operator python == compares by value versus java which compares numerics by value objects by reference value comparisons java on objects can be performed with equals method python's operator may be used compare object identities comparison by reference python comparisons may be chained for example python package pyjulia allows calling other direction from python ocaml has optional syntax named twt whitespace thing inspired by python haskell ruby's creator yukihiro matsumoto has said i wanted scripting language that was more powerful than perl more object-oriented than python that's why i decided design my own language coffeescript programming language that cross-compiles javascript has python-inspired syntax swift programming language invented by apple has some python-inspired syntax python's development practices have also been emulated by other languages practice requiring document describing rationale for issues surrounding change language python's case pep also used tcl erlang
