company see computer technology limited difference engine computing solution polynomial function computer laboratory moody hall james madison university rack servers from computing any goal-oriented activity requiring benefiting from creating mathematical sequence steps known algorithm — eg through computers computing includes designing developing building hardware software systems processing structuring managing various kinds information doing scientific research on with computers making computer systems behave intelligently creating using communications entertainment media field computing includes computer engineering software engineering computer science information systems information technology contents definitions history computer o computer software hardware +

definitions acm computing curricula defined computing follows general way we can define computing mean any goal-oriented activity requiring benefiting from creating computers thus computing includes designing building hardware software systems for wide range purposes processing structuring managing various kinds information doing scientific studies using computers making computer systems behave intelligently creating using communications entertainment media finding gathering information relevant any particular purpose so on list virtually endless possibilities are vast defines five sub-disciplines computing field computer science computer engineering information systems information technology software engineering however computing curricula also recognizes that meaning computing depends on context computing also has other meanings that are more specific based on context which term used for example information systems specialist will view computing somewhat differently from software engineer regardless context doing computing well can be complicated difficult because society needs people do computing well we must think computing not only profession but also discipline term computing has sometimes been narrowly defined acm report on computing discipline discipline computing systematic study algorithmic processes that describe transform information their theory analysis design efficiency implementation application fundamental question underlying all computing what can be efficiently automated term computing also synonymous with counting calculating earlier times was used reference action performed by mechanical computing machines before that human computers history main articles history computing timeline computing ibm computer history computing longer than history computing hardware modern computing technology includes history methods intended for pen paper for chalk slate with without aid tables computing intimately tied representation numbers but long before abstractions like number arose there were mathematical concepts serve purposes civilization these concepts include one-to-one correspondence basis counting comparison standard used for measurement 3-4-5 right triangle device for assuring right angle earliest known tool for use computation was abacus was thought have been invented babylon circa bc its original style usage was by lines drawn sand with pebbles abaci more modern design are still used calculation tools today this was first known computer most advanced system calculation known date - preceding greek methods by years first recorded idea using digital electronics for computing was paper use thyratrons for high speed automatic counting physical phenomena by c e wynn-williams claude shannon's paper symbolic analysis relay switching circuits then introduced idea using electronics for boolean algebraic operations computer main articles computer outline computers glossary computer terms computer machine that manipulates data according set instructions called computer program program has executable form that computer can use directly execute instructions same program its human-readable source code form enables programmer study develop sequence steps known algorithm because instructions can be carried out different types computers single set source instructions converts machine instructions according central processing unit type execution process carries out instructions computer program instructions express computations performed by computer they trigger sequences simple actions on executing machine those actions produce effects according semantics instructions computer software hardware main articles software computer hardware computer software just software collection computer programs related data that provides instructions for telling computer what do how do software refers one more computer programs data held storage computer for some purposes other words software set programs procedures algorithms its documentation concerned with operation data processing system program software performs function program implements either by directly providing instructions computer hardware by serving input another piece software term was coined contrast with old term hardware meaning physical devices contrast hardware software intangible software also sometimes used more narrow sense meaning application software only application software main article application software application software also known application app computer software designed help user perform specific tasks examples include enterprise software accounting software office suites graphics software media players many application programs deal principally with documents apps may be bundled with computer its system software may be published separately some users are satisfied with bundled apps need never install one application software contrasted with system software middleware which manage integrate computer's capabilities but typically do not directly apply them performance tasks that benefit user system software serves application which turn serves user application software applies power particular computing platform system software particular purpose some apps such microsoft office are available versions for several different platforms others have narrower requirements are thus called for example geography application for windows android application for education linux gaming sometimes new popular application arises that only runs on one platform increasing desirability that platform this called killer application system software main article system software system software systems software computer software designed operate control computer hardware provide platform for running application software system software includes operating systems utility software device drivers window systems firmware frequently development tools such compilers linkers debuggers are classified system software computer network main article computer network computer network often simply referred network collection hardware components computers interconnected by communication channels that allow sharing resources information where at least one process one device able send/receive data to/from at least one process residing remote device then two devices are said be network networks may be classified according wide variety characteristics such medium used transport data communications protocol used scale topology organizational scope communications protocols define rules data formats for exchanging information computer network provide basis for network programming well-known communications protocols are ethernet hardware link layer standard that ubiquitous local area networks internet protocol suite which defines set protocols for internetworking ie for data communication between multiple networks well host-to-host data transfer application-specific data transmission formats computer networking sometimes considered sub-discipline electrical engineering telecommunications computer science information technology computer engineering since relies upon theoretical practical application these disciplines internet internet global system interconnected computer networks that use standard internet protocol suite tcp/ip serve billions users that consists

more restrictive demanding than natural languages but easily translated by computer purpose programming invoke desired behavior customization from machine process writing high quality source code requires knowledge both application's domain computer science domain highest-quality software thus developed by team various domain experts each person specialist some area development but term
