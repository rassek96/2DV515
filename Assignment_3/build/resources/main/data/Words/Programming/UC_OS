stylized µc/os real-time operating system rtos designed by embedded software developer jean j labrosse priority-based pre-emptive real-time kernel for microprocessors written mostly c programming language intended for use embedded systems microc/os allows defining several functions c each which can execute independent thread task each task runs at different priority runs if owns cpu lower priority tasks can be preempted by higher priority tasks at any time higher priority tasks use operating system services such delay event allow lower priority tasks execute there are operating system

programming magazine book µc/os real-time kernel by jean j labrosse isbn 0-87930-444-8 author intended at first simply describe internals portable operating system he had developed for his own use but later developed os commercial product versions ii iii writing applications under μc/os tasks running under multitasking kernel should be written one two ways non-returning endless loop task that deletes itself after running µc/os-ii based on source code written for µc/os introduced commercial product µc/os-ii portable rom-able scalable pre-emptive real-time deterministic multitasking kernel for microprocessors digital signal processor dsps manages up application tasks its size can be scaled between kbytes kbytes only contain features needed for specific use most µc/os-ii written highly portable ansi c with target microprocessor-specific code written assembly language assembly language use minimized ease porting other processors uses embedded systems µc/os-ii was designed for embedded uses which means that if producer has proper tool chain ie c compiler assembler linker/locator they can embed µc/os-ii part product µc/os-ii can be found following embedded systems avionics medical equipment/devices data communications equipment white goods appliances mobile phones pdas mids industrial controls consumer electronics automotive task states µc/os-ii multitasking operating system each task infinite loop can be any one following five states see figure below additionally dormant ready running waiting for event interrupted interrupted isr additionally can manage up tasks however recommended that user reserve eight these tasks for µc/os-ii leaving application up tasks kernels kernel name given program that does most housekeeping tasks for operating system boot loader hands control over kernel which initializes various devices known state makes computer ready for general operations kernel responsible for task management ie for managing cpu’s time communication between tasks fundamental service provided by kernel context switching scheduler part kernel responsible for determining which task runs next most real-time kernels are priority based priority-based kernel control cpu always given highest priority task ready run two types priority-based kernels exist non-preemptive preemptive non-preemptive kernels require that each task do something explicitly give up control cpu preemptive kernel used when system responsiveness important therefore µc/os-ii most commercial real-time kernels are preemptive highest priority task ready run always given control cpu assigning tasks tasks with highest rate execution are given highest priority using rate-monotonic scheduling this scheduling algorithm used real-time operating systems rtos with static-priority scheduling class managing tasks computing task unit execution some operating systems task synonymous with process others with thread batch processing computer systems task unit execution within job system user µc/os-ii able control tasks by using following features task feature task creation task stack & stack checking task deletion change task’s priority suspend resume task get information about task managing memory order avoid fragmentation µc/os-ii allows applications obtain fixed-sized memory blocks from partition made contiguous memory area all memory blocks are same size partition contains integral number blocks allocation deallocation these memory blocks done constant time deterministic system managing time µc/os-ii requires that user provide periodic time source keep track time delays timeouts tick should occur between times per second hertz faster tick rate more overhead µc/os-ii imposes on system frequency clock tick depends on desired tick resolution application tick sources can be obtained by dedicating hardware timer by generating interrupt from ac power line 50/60 hz signal this periodic time source called clock tick after clock tick determined tasks can be delaying task resume delayed task communicating between tasks intertask interprocess communication µc/os-ii occurs via semaphores message mailbox message queues tasks interrupt service routines isr they can interact with each other when task isr signals task through kernel object called event control block ecb signal considered be event microc/os-iii µc/os-iii acronym for micro-controller operating systems version introduced adding functionality µc/os-ii rtos µc/os-iii offers all features functions µc/os-ii biggest difference number tasks µc/os-ii allows only task at each priority levels so maximum tasks µc/os-iii allows unlimited number application tasks at each one unlimited number priority levels constrained only by processor’s access memory µc/os-ii µc/os-iii are currently maintained by micrium inc can be licensed per product per product line uses embedded systems uses are same for µc/os-ii task states µc/os-iii multitasking operating system each task infinite loop can be any one following five states see figure task priorities can range from highest priority maximum lowest possible priority round robin scheduling when two more tasks have same priority kernel allows one task run for predetermined amount time called quantum then selects another task this process called round robin scheduling time slicing kernel gives control next task line if current task has no work do during its time slice current task completes before end its time slice time slice ends kernels kernel functionality for µc/os-iii same for µc/os-ii managing tasks task management also functions same for µc/os-ii however µc/os-iii supports multitasking allows application have any number tasks maximum number tasks limited by only amount memory both code data space available processor task can be implemented via run completion scheduling which task deletes itself when finished more typically infinite loop waiting for events occur processing those events managing memory memory management handled same way performed µc/os-ii managing time µc/os-iii offers same time management features µc/os-ii also provides services applications so that tasks can suspend their execution for user-defined time delays delays are either specified by number clock ticks hours minutes seconds milliseconds communicating between tasks sometimes necessary for task isr communicate information another task because unsafe for two tasks access same specific data hardware resource simultaneously this can be resolved through information transfer called inter-task communication this information transfer called inter-task communication information can be communicated between tasks two ways through global data by sending messages when using global variables each task isr must ensure that has exclusive access variables if isr involved only way ensure exclusive access common variables disable interrupts if two tasks share data each can gain exclusive access variables either by disabling interrupts locking scheduler using semaphore preferably using mutual exclusion semaphore messages can either be sent intermediate object called message queue directly task since µc/os-iii each task has its own built-in message queue use external message queue if multiple tasks are wait for messages send message directly task if only one task will process data received when task waits for message
