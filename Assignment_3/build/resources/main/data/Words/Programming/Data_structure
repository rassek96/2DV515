data structure from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search hash table not be confused with data type computer science data structure particular way organizing data computer so that can be used efficiently data structures can implement one more particular abstract data types adt which specify operations that can be performed on data structure computational complexity those operations comparison data structure concrete implementation specification provided by adt different kinds data structures are suited different kinds applications some are highly specialized specific tasks for example relational databases commonly use b-tree indexes for data retrieval while compiler implementations usually use hash tables look up identifiers data structures provide means manage large amounts data efficiently for uses such large databases internet indexing services usually efficient data structures are key designing efficient algorithms some formal design methods programming languages emphasize data structures rather than algorithms key organizing factor software design data structures can be used organize storage retrieval information stored both main memory secondary memory contents overview examples language support see also references further reading external links overview data structures are generally based on ability computer fetch store data at any place its memory specified by pointer—a bit string representing memory address that can be itself stored memory manipulated by program thus array record data structures are based on computing addresses data items with arithmetic operations while linked data structures are based on storing addresses data items within structure itself many data structures use both principles sometimes combined non-trivial ways xor linking implementation data structure usually requires writing set procedures that create manipulate instances that structure efficiency data structure cannot be analyzed separately from those operations this observation motivates theoretical concept abstract data type data structure that defined indirectly by operations that may be performed on mathematical properties those operations including their space time cost examples main article list data structures there are numerous types data structures generally built upon simpler primitive data types array number elements specific order typically all same type elements are accessed using integer index specify which element required depending on language individual elements may either all be forced be same type may be almost any type typical implementations allocate contiguous memory words for elements arrays but this not always necessity arrays may be fixed-length resizable linked list also just called list linear collection data elements any type called nodes where each node has itself value points next node linked list principal advantage linked list over array that values can always be efficiently inserted removed without relocating rest list certain other operations such random access certain element are however slower on lists than on arrays record also called tuple struct aggregate data structure record value that contains other values typically fixed number sequence typically indexed by names elements records are usually called fields members union data structure that specifies which number permitted primitive types may be stored its instances eg float long integer contrast with record which could be defined contain float integer whereas union there only one value at time enough space allocated contain widest member datatype tagged union also called variant variant record discriminated union disjoint union contains additional field indicating its current type for enhanced type safety class data structure that contains data fields like record well various methods which operate on contents record context object-oriented programming records are known plain old data structures distinguish them from classes language support most assembly languages some low-level languages such bcpl basic combined programming language lack built-in support for data structures on other hand many high-level programming languages some higher-level assembly languages such masm have special syntax other built-in support for certain data structures such records arrays for example c pascal languages support structs records respectively addition vectors one-dimensional arrays multi-dimensional arrays most programming languages feature some sort library mechanism that allows data structure implementations be reused by different programs modern languages usually come with standard libraries that implement most common data structures examples are c++ standard template library java collections framework microsoft's net framework modern languages also generally support modular programming separation between interface library module its implementation some provide opaque data types that allow clients hide implementation details object-oriented programming languages such c++ java smalltalk may use classes for this purpose many known data structures have concurrent versions that allow multiple computing threads access data structure simultaneously see also book data structures abstract data type concurrent data structure data model dynamization linked data structure list
