embossing printmaking main article printmaking printmaking process making artworks by printing on paper other materials surfaces except case monotyping process capable producing multiples same piece which called print each piece not copy but original since not reproduction another work art technically known impression painting drawing on other hand creates unique original piece artwork prints are created from single original surface known technically matrix common types matrices include plates metal usually copper zinc for engraving etching stone used for lithography blocks wood for woodcuts linoleum for linocuts fabric plates for screen-printing but there are many other kinds discussed below works printed from single plate create edition modern times usually each signed numbered form limited edition prints may also be published book form artist's books single print could be product one multiple techniques tools pencil one most basic graphic design tools aside from technology graphic design requires judgment creativity critical observational quantitative analytic thinking are required for design layouts rendering if executor merely following solution eg sketch script instructions provided by another designer such art director then executor not usually considered designer method presentation eg arrangement style medium may be equally important design appropriate development presentation tools can substantially change how audience perceives project image layout produced using external traditional media guides digital image editing tools on computers tools computer graphics often take on traditional names such scissors pen some graphic design tools such grid are used both traditional digital form mid-1980s arrival desktop publishing graphic art software applications introduced generation designers computer image manipulation creation that had previously been manually executed computer graphic design enabled designers instantly see effects layout typographic changes simulate effects traditional media without requiring lot space however traditional tools such pencils markers are useful even when computers are used for finalization designer art director may hand sketch numerous concepts part creative process some these sketches may even be shown client for early stage approval before designer develops idea further using computer graphic design software tools computers are considered indispensable tool graphic design industry computers software applications are generally seen by creative professionals more effective production tools than traditional methods however some designers continue use manual traditional tools for production such milton glaser new ideas can come by way experimenting with tools methods some designers explore ideas using pencil paper others use many different mark-making tools resources from computers sculpture means inspiring creativity one key features graphic design that makes tool out appropriate image selection order possibly convey meaning computers creative process there some debate whether computers enhance creative process graphic design rapid production from computer allows many designers explore multiple ideas quickly with more detail than what could be achieved by traditional hand-rendering paste-up on paper moving designer through creative process more quickly however being faced with limitless choices does not help isolate best design solution can lead endless iterations with no clear design outcome graphic designer may use sketches explore multiple complex ideas quickly without distractions complications software hand-rendered comps are often used get approval for idea execution before designer invests time produce finished visuals on computer paste-up same thumbnail sketches rough drafts on paper may be used rapidly refine produce idea on computer hybrid process this hybrid process especially useful logo design where software learning curve may detract from creative thought process traditional-design/computer-production hybrid process may be used for freeing one's creativity page layout image development well early days computer publishing many traditional graphic designers relied on computer-savvy production artists produce their ideas from sketches without needing learn computer skills themselves however this practice has been increasingly less common since advent desktop publishing over years ago use computers graphics software now taught most graphic design courses nearly all popular industry standard software programs used for
