through series evolutions united states canada from its founding primarily served small communities without access television station ones with adverse location that prevented reception outside signals even if they were not far away such being valley particularly canada communities with their own signals were fertile cable markets viewers wanted receive american signals early systems carried only maximum seven channels using equipment was unable confine signal discreetly within assigned channel bandwidth equipment improved all twelve channels could be utilized except where local vhf television station broadcast local broadcast channels were not usable for signals deemed be priority but technology allowed low-priority signals be placed on such channels by synchronizing their blanking intervals similarly local vhf station could not be carried on its broadcast channel signals would arrive at tv set slightly separated time causing ghosting bandwidth amplifiers also was limited meaning frequencies over mhz were difficult transmit distant portions coaxial network uhf channels could not be used at all expand beyond channels non-standard midband channels had be used located between fm band channel superband beyond channel up about mhz these channels initially were only accessible using separate tuner boxes that sent chosen channel into tv set on channel later cable operators began carry fm radio stations encouraged subscribers connect their fm stereo sets cable before multichannel television sound became common pay-tv channel sound was added fm cable line-ups about this time operators expanded beyond 12-channel dial use midband superband vhf channels adjacent high band 7-13 north american television frequencies some operators cornwall ontario used dual distribution network with channels 2-13 on each two cables during 1980s united states regulations not unlike public educational government access peg created beginning cable-originated live television programming this evolved into today's many cable-only broadcasts diverse programming including cable-only produced television movies miniseries live local programs with local interests were rapidly created all over united states most major television markets early 1980s cable specialty channels starting with channels oriented show movies large sporting performance events diversified further narrowcasting became common by late 1980s cable-only signals outnumbered broadcast signals on cable systems some systems were going beyond channels by mid-1980s canada cable operators were allowed by regulator enter into distribution contracts with cable networks large cable companies used addressable descramblers limit access premium channels paying customers by 1990s tiers became common with customers able subscribe different tiers obtain different selections additional channels above basic selection by subscribing additional tiers customers could get specialty channels movie channels foreign channels during 1990s pressure accommodate growing array offerings resulted digital transmission that made more efficient use vhf signal capacity fibre optics was common carry signals into areas near home where coax could carry higher frequencies over short remaining distance although for time 1980s 1990s television receivers vcrs were equipped receive mid-band super-band channels such cable-ready tuners are rarely used now requiring return set-top boxes used from 1970s onward conversion digital broadcasting has put all signals - broadcast cable - into digital form rendering analog cable television service mostly obsolete functional select markets analog television sets are still accommodated but their tuners are mostly obsolete oftentimes dependent entirely on set-top box distribution cable television distribution box left basement building germany with splitter right which supplies signal separate cables which go different rooms receive cable television at given location cable distribution lines must be available on local utility poles underground utility lines coaxial cable brings signal customer's building through service drop overhead underground cable if subscriber's building does not have cable service drop cable company will install one standard cable used us rg-6 which has ohm impedance connects with type f connector cable company's portion wiring usually ends at distribution box on building exterior built-in cable wiring walls usually distributes signal jacks different rooms which televisions are connected multiple cables different rooms are split off incoming cable with small device called splitter there are two standards for cable television older analog cable newer digital cable which can carry data signals used by digital television receivers such hdtv equipment all cable companies united states have switched are course switching digital cable television since was first introduced late 1990s most cable companies require set-top box view their cable channels even on newer televisions with digital cable qam tuners because most digital cable channels are now encrypted scrambled reduce cable service theft cable from jack wall attached input box output cable from box attached television usually rf-in composite input on older tvs some unencrypted channels usually traditional over-the-air broadcast networks can be displayed without receiver box cable company will provide set top boxes based on level service customer purchases from basic set top boxes with standard definition picture connected through standard coaxial connection on tv high-definition wireless dvr receivers connected via hdmi component older analog television sets are cable ready can receive old analog cable without set-top box receive digital cable channels on analog television set even unencrypted ones requires different type box digital television adapter supplied by cable company new distribution method that takes advantage low cost high quality dvb distribution residential areas uses tv gateways convert dvb-c dvb-c2 stream ip for distribution tv over ip network home principle operation diagram modern hybrid fiber-coaxial cable television system at regional headend tv channels are sent multiplexed on light beam which travels through optical fiber trunklines which fan out from distribution hubs optical nodes local communities here light signal from fiber translated radio frequency electrical signal which distributed through coaxial cable individual subscriber homes most common system multiple television channels many although this varies depending on provider's available channel capacity are distributed subscriber residences through coaxial cable which comes from trunkline supported on utility poles originating at cable company's local distribution facility called headend many channels can be transmitted through one coaxial cable by technique called frequency division multiplexing at headend each television channel translated different frequency by giving each channel different frequency slot on cable separate television signals do not interfere with each other at subscriber's residence either subscriber's television set-top box provided by cable company translates desired channel back its original frequency baseband displayed onscreen due widespread cable theft earlier analog systems signals are typically encrypted on modern digital cable systems set-top box must be activated by activation code sent by cable company before will function which only sent after subscriber signs up there are also usually upstream channels on cable send data from customer box cable headend for advanced features such requesting pay-per-view shows movies cable internet access cable telephone service downstream channels occupy band frequencies from approximately mhz ghz while upstream channels occupy frequencies mhz subscribers pay with monthly fee subscribers can choose from several levels service with premium packages including more channels but costing higher rate at local headend feed signals from individual television channels are received by dish antennas from communication satellites additional local channels such local broadcast television stations educational channels from local colleges community access channels devoted local governments peg channels are usually included on cable service commercial advertisements for local business are also inserted programming at headend individual channels which are distributed nationally also have their own nationally oriented commercials hybrid fiber-coaxial main article hybrid fibre-coaxial modern cable systems are large with single network headend often serving entire metropolitan area most systems use hybrid fiber-coaxial hfc distribution this means trunklines that carry signal from headend local neighborhoods are optical fiber provide greater bandwidth also extra capacity for future expansion at headend radio frequency electrical signal carrying all channels modulated on light beam sent through fiber fiber trunkline goes several distribution hubs from which multiple fibers fan out carry signal boxes called optical nodes local communities at optical node light beam from fiber translated back electrical signal carried by coaxial cable distribution lines on utility poles from which cables branch out

cable television has had little success africa not cost-effective lay cables sparsely populated areas so-called wireless cable microwave-based systems are used instead other cable-based services coaxial cables are capable bi-directional carriage signals well transmission large amounts data cable television signals use only portion bandwidth available over coaxial lines this leaves plenty space available for other digital services such cable internet cable telephony wireless services using both unlicensed licensed spectrum broadband internet access achieved over coaxial cable by using cable modems convert network data into type digital signal that can be transferred over coaxial cable one problem with some cable systems older amplifiers placed along cable routes are unidirectional thus order allow for uploading data customer would need use analog telephone modem provide for upstream connection this limited upstream speed 312k prevented always-on convenience broadband internet typically provides many large cable systems have upgraded are upgrading their equipment allow for bi-directional signals thus allowing for greater upload speed always-on convenience though these upgrades are expensive north america australia europe many cable operators have already introduced cable telephone service which operates just like existing fixed line operators this service involves installing special telephone interface at customer's premises that converts analog signals from customer's in-home wiring into digital signal which then sent on local loop replacing analog last mile
