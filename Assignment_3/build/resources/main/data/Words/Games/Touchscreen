touchscreen from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search for hewlett-packard computer see hp touchscreen touch sensitive redirects here for other uses see touch sensitive touchscreen important source input device output device normally layered on top electronic visual display information processing system user can give input control information processing system through simple multi-touch gestures by touching screen with special stylus and/or one more fingers some touchscreens use ordinary specially coated gloves work while others use special stylus/pen only user can use touchscreen react what displayed control how displayed for example zooming increase text size touchscreen enables user interact directly with what displayed rather than using mouse touchpad any other intermediate device other than stylus which optional for most modern touchscreens touchscreens are common devices such game consoles personal computers tablet computers electronic voting machines smartphones they can also be attached computers terminals networks they also play prominent role design digital appliances such personal digital assistants pdas some e-readers popularity smartphones tablets many types information appliances driving demand acceptance common touchscreens for portable functional electronics touchscreens are found medical field heavy industry well for automated

by bent stumpe danish electronics engineer for control room cern’s accelerator sps super proton synchrotron this was further development self-capacitance screen right also developed by stumpe at cern ea johnson royal radar establishment malvern described his work on capacitive touchscreens short article published then more fully—with photographs diagrams—in article published applicability touch technology for air traffic control was described article published frank beck bent stumpe engineers from cern developed transparent touchscreen early 1970s based on stumpe's work at television factory early 1960s then manufactured by cern was put use resistive touchscreen was developed by american inventor george samuel hurst who received us patent on october first version was produced group at university illinois filed for patent on optical touchscreen that became standard part magnavox plato iv student terminal thousands were built for plato iv system these touchscreens had crossed array by infrared position sensors each composed led on one edge screen matched phototransistor on other edge all mounted front monochrome plasma display panel this arrangement can sense any fingertip-sized opaque object close proximity screen similar touchscreen was used on hp-150 starting this was one world's earliest commercial touchscreen computers hp mounted their infrared transmitters receivers around bezel sony cathode ray tube crt fujitsu released touch pad for micro deal with complexity kanji characters which were stored tiled graphics sega released terebi oekaki also known sega graphic board for sg-1000 video game console sc-3000 home computer consisted plastic pen plastic board with transparent window where pen presses are detected was used primarily for drawing software application graphic touch tablet was released for sega ai computer touch-sensitive control-display units cduswere evaluated for commercial aircraft flight decks early 1980s initial research showed that touch interface would reduce pilot workload crew could then select waypoints functions actions rather than be head down typing latitudes longitudes waypoint codes on keyboard effective integration this technology was aimed at helping flight crews maintain high-level situational awareness all major aspects vehicle operations including its flight path functioning various aircraft systems moment-to-moment human interactions early 1980s general motors tasked its delco electronics division with project aimed at replacing automobile's non essential functions ie other than throttle transmission braking steering from mechanical electro-mechanical systems with solid state alternatives wherever possible finished device was dubbed ecc for electronic control center digital computer software control system hardwired various peripheral sensors servos solenoids antenna monochrome crt touchscreen that functioned both display sole method input ecc replaced traditional mechanical stereo fan heater air conditioner controls displays was capable providing very detailed specific information about vehicle's cumulative current operating status real time ecc was standard equipment on 1985–89 buick riviera later 1988–89 buick reatta but was unpopular with consumers partly due technophobia some traditional buick customers but mostly because costly repair technical problems suffered by ecc's touchscreen which being sole access method would render climate control stereo operation impossible multi-touch technology began when university toronto's input research group developed first human-input multi-touch system using frosted-glass panel with camera placed behind glass university toronto group including bill buxton developed multi-touch tablet that used capacitance rather than bulky camera-based optical sensing systems see history multi-touch first graphical point sale software was demonstrated on 16-bit atari 520st color computer featured color touchscreen widget-driven interface viewtouch point sale software was first shown by its developer gene mosher at fall comdex las vegas nevada visitors at atari computer demonstration area was first commercially available pos system with widget-driven color graphic touchscreen interface casio launched casio pb-1000 pocket computer with touchscreen consisting 4x4 matrix resulting touch areas its small lcd graphic screen until touchscreens had bad reputation being imprecise most user interface books would state that touchscreens selections were limited targets larger than average finger at time selections were done such way that target was selected soon finger came over corresponding action was performed immediately errors were common due parallax calibration problems leading frustration new strategy called lift-off strategy was introduced by researchers at university maryland human – computer interaction lab still used today users touch screen feedback provided what will be selected users can adjust position finger action takes place only when finger lifted off screen this allowed selection small targets down single pixel on vga screen standard best time sears et al gave review academic research on single multi-touch human–computer interaction time describing gestures such rotating knobs adjusting sliders swiping screen activate switch u-shaped gesture for toggle switch university maryland human – computer interaction lab team developed studied small touchscreen keyboards including study that showed that users could type at wpm for touchscreen keyboard compared with wpm for standard keyboard thereby paving way for touchscreen keyboards on mobile devices they also designed implemented multitouch gestures such selecting range line connecting objects tap-click gesture select while maintaining location with another finger university maryland human – computer interaction lab demonstrated touchscreen slider which was later cited prior art lock screen patent litigation between apple other touchscreen mobile phone vendors relation us patent c 1991–92 sun star7 prototype pda implemented touchscreen with inertial scrolling ibm simon—the first touchscreen phone—was released early attempt at handheld game console with touchscreen controls was sega's intended successor game gear though device was ultimately shelved never released due expensive cost touchscreen technology early 1990s touchscreens would not be popularly used for video games until release nintendo ds until recently most consumer touchscreens could only sense one point contact at time few have had capability sense how hard one touching this has changed with commercialization multi-touch technology technologies there are variety touchscreen technologies with different methods sensing touch resistive main article resistive touchscreen resistive touchscreen panel comprises several layers most important which are two thin transparent electrically resistive layers separated by thin space these layers face each other with thin gap between top screen screen that touched has coating on underside surface screen just beneath similar resistive layer on top its substrate one layer has conductive connections along its sides other along top bottom voltage applied one layer sensed by other when object such fingertip stylus tip presses down onto outer surface two layers touch become connected at that point panel then behaves pair voltage dividers one axis at time by rapidly switching between each layer position pressure on screen can be read resistive touch used restaurants factories hospitals due its high resistance liquids contaminants major benefit resistive touch technology its low cost additionally only sufficient pressure necessary for touch be sensed they may be used with gloves on by using anything rigid finger/stylus substitute disadvantages include need press down risk damage by sharp objects resistive touchscreens also suffer from poorer contrast due having additional reflections from extra layers material separated by air gap placed over screen this type touchscreen used by nintendo ds family 3ds family wii u gamepad surface acoustic wave main article surface acoustic wave surface acoustic wave saw technology uses ultrasonic waves that pass over touchscreen panel when panel touched portion wave absorbed this change ultrasonic waves registers position touch event sends this information controller for processing surface acoustic wave touchscreen panels can be damaged by outside elements contaminants on surface can also interfere with functionality touchscreen capacitive capacitive touchscreen mobile phone main article capacitive sensing capacitive touchscreen panel consists insulator such glass coated with transparent conductor such indium tin oxide ito human body also electrical conductor touching surface screen results distortion screen's electrostatic field measurable change capacitance different technologies may be used determine location touch location then sent controller for processing unlike resistive touchscreen one cannot use capacitive touchscreen through most types electrically insulating material such gloves this disadvantage especially affects usability consumer electronics such touch tablet pcs capacitive smartphones cold weather can be overcome with special capacitive stylus special-application glove with embroidered patch conductive thread passing through contacting user's fingertip largest capacitive display manufacturers continue develop thinner more accurate touchscreens with touchscreens for mobile devices now being produced with 'in-cell' technology that eliminates layer such samsung's super amoled screens by building capacitors inside display itself this type touchscreen reduces visible distance within millimetres between user's finger what user touching on screen creating more direct contact with content displayed enabling taps gestures be more responsive simple parallel plate capacitor has two conductors separated by dielectric layer most energy this system concentrated directly between plates some energy spills over into area outside plates electric field lines associated with this effect are called fringing fields part challenge making practical capacitive sensor design set printed circuit traces which direct fringing fields into active sensing area accessible user parallel plate capacitor not good choice for such sensor pattern placing finger near fringing electric fields adds conductive surface area capacitive system additional charge storage capacity added by finger known finger capacitance cf capacitance sensor without finger present denoted cp this article which stands for parasitic capacitance surface capacitance this basic technology only one side insulator coated with conductive layer small voltage applied layer resulting uniform electrostatic field when conductor such human finger touches uncoated surface capacitor dynamically formed sensor's controller can determine location touch indirectly from change capacitance measured from four corners panel has no moving parts moderately durable but has limited resolution prone false signals from parasitic capacitive coupling needs calibration during manufacture therefore most often used simple applications such industrial controls kiosks projected capacitance back side multitouch globe based on projected capacitive touch pct technology schema projected-capacitive touchscreen projected capacitive touch pct also pcap technology variant capacitive touch technology all pct touch screens are made up matrix rows columns conductive material layered on sheets glass this can be done either by etching single conductive layer form grid pattern electrodes by etching two separate perpendicular layers conductive material with parallel lines tracks form grid voltage applied this grid creates uniform electrostatic field which can be measured when conductive object such finger comes into contact with pct panel distorts local electrostatic field at that point this measurable change capacitance if finger bridges gap between two tracks charge field further interrupted detected by controller capacitance can be changed measured at every individual point on grid intersection therefore this system able accurately track touches due top layer pct being glass more robust solution than less costly resistive touch technology additionally unlike traditional capacitive touch technology possible for pct system sense passive stylus gloved fingers however moisture on surface panel high humidity collected dust can interfere with performance pct system there are two types pct mutual capacitance self-capacitance mutual capacitance this common pct approach which makes use fact that most conductive objects are able hold charge if they are very close together mutual capacitive sensors capacitor inherently formed by row trace column trace at each intersection grid 16-by-14 array for example would have independent capacitors voltage applied rows columns bringing finger conductive stylus close surface sensor changes local electrostatic field which reduces mutual capacitance capacitance change at every individual point on grid can be measured accurately determine touch location by measuring voltage other axis mutual capacitance allows multi-touch operation where multiple fingers palms styli can be accurately tracked at same time self-capacitance self-capacitance sensors can have same x-y grid mutual capacitance sensors but columns rows operate independently with self-capacitance capacitive load finger measured on each column row electrode by current meter this method produces stronger signal than mutual capacitance but unable resolve accurately more than one finger which results ghosting misplaced location sensing use styli on capacitive screens capacitive touchscreens don't necessarily need be operated by finger but until recently special styli required could be quite expensive purchase cost this technology has fallen greatly recent years capacitative styli are now widely available for nominal charge often given away free with mobile accessories infrared grid infrared sensors mounted around display watch for user's touchscreen input on this plato v terminal monochromatic plasma display's characteristic orange glow illustrated infrared touchscreen uses array x-y infrared led photodetector pairs around edges screen detect disruption pattern led beams these led beams cross each other vertical horizontal patterns this helps sensors pick up exact location touch major benefit such system that can detect essentially any input including finger gloved finger stylus pen generally used outdoor applications point sale systems which can not rely on conductor such bare finger activate touchscreen unlike capacitive touchscreens infrared touchscreens do not require any patterning on glass which increases durability optical clarity overall system infrared touchscreens are sensitive dirt/dust that can interfere with ir beams suffer from parallax curved surfaces accidental press when user hovers his/her finger over screen while searching for item be selected infrared acrylic projection translucent acrylic sheet used rear projection screen display information edges acrylic sheet are illuminated by infrared leds infrared cameras are focused on back sheet objects placed on sheet are detectable by cameras when sheet touched by user deformation results leakage infrared light which peaks at points maximum pressure indicating user's touch location microsoft's pixelsense tables use this technology optical imaging optical touchscreens are relatively modern development touchscreen technology which two more image sensors are placed around edges mostly corners screen infrared back lights are placed camera's field view on other side screen touch shows up shadow each pair cameras can then be pinpointed locate touch even measure size touching object see visual hull this technology growing popularity due its scalability versatility affordability especially for bigger units dispersive signal technology introduced by 3m this system uses sensors detect piezoelectricity glass that occurs due touch complex algorithms then interpret this information provide actual location touch technology claims be unaffected by dust other outside elements including scratches since there no need for additional elements on screen also claims provide excellent optical clarity also since mechanical vibrations are used detect touch event any object can be used generate these events including fingers stylus downside that after initial touch system cannot detect motionless finger acoustic pulse recognition key this technology that touch at any one position on surface generates sound wave substrate which then produces unique combined sound after being picked up by three more tiny transducers attached edges touchscreen sound then digitized by controller list pre-recorded sounds for every position on surface cursor position instantly updated touch location moving touch tracked by rapid repetition this process extraneous ambient sounds are ignored since they do not match any stored sound profile technology differs from other attempts recognize position touch with transducers microphones using simple table look-up method rather than requiring powerful expensive signal processing hardware attempt calculate touch location without any references with dispersive signal technology system motionless finger cannot be detected after initial touch however for same reason touch recognition not disrupted by any resting objects technology was created by soundtouch ltd early 2000s described by patent family ep1852772 introduced market by tyco international's elo division acoustic pulse recognition touchscreen used by elo made ordinary glass giving good durability optical clarity apr usually able function with scratches dust on screen with good accuracy technology also well suited displays that are physically larger construction there are several principal ways build touchscreen key goals are recognize one more fingers touching display interpret command that this represents communicate command appropriate application most popular techniques capacitive resistive approach there are typically four layers top polyester coated with transparent metallic conductive coating on bottom adhesive spacer glass layer coated with transparent metallic conductive coating on top adhesive layer on backside glass for mounting when user touches surface system records change electric current that flows through display dispersive-signal technology which 3m created measures piezoelectric effect—the voltage generated when mechanical force applied material—that occurs chemically when strengthened glass substrate touched there are two infrared-based approaches one array sensors detects finger touching almost touching display thereby interrupting light beams projected over screen other bottom-mounted infrared cameras record screen touches each case system determines intended command based on controls showing on screen at time location touch development development multipoint touchscreens facilitated tracking more than one finger on screen thus operations that require more than one finger are possible these devices also allow multiple users interact with touchscreen simultaneously with growing use touchscreens marginal cost touchscreen technology routinely absorbed into products that incorporate nearly eliminated touchscreens now have proven reliability thus touchscreen displays are found today airplanes automobiles gaming consoles machine control systems appliances handheld display devices including nintendo ds multi-touch enabled cellphones touchscreen market for mobile devices was projected produce us$5 billion by ability accurately point on screen itself also advancing with emerging graphics tablet/screen hybrids pvdf plays major role this innovation due its high piezoelectric properties tapsense announced october allows touchscreens distinguish what part hand was used for input such fingertip knuckle fingernail this could be used variety ways for example copy paste capitalize letters activate different drawing modes similar ergonomics usage touchscreen accuracy users must be able accurately select targets on touchscreens avoid accidental selection adjacent targets effectively use touchscreen input device design touchscreen interfaces must reflect both technical capabilities system ergonomics cognitive psychology human physiology guidelines for touchscreen designs were first developed 1990s based on early research actual use older systems so assume use contemporary sensing technology such infrared grids these types touchscreens are highly dependent on size user's fingers so their guidelines are less relevant for bulk modern devices using capacitive resistive touch technology from mid-2000s onward makers operating systems for smartphones have promulgated standards but these vary between manufacturers allow for significant variation size based on technology changes so are unsuitable from human factors perspective much more important accuracy humans have selecting targets with their finger pen stylus accuracy user selection varies by position on screen users are most accurate at center less so at left right edges much less accurate at top especially bottom edges r95 accuracy varies from mm center mm lower corners users are subconsciously aware this are also slightly slower taking more time select smaller targets any at edges corners this inaccuracy result parallax visual acuity speed feedback loop between eyes fingers precision human finger alone much much higher than this so when assistive technologies are provided such on-screen magnifiers users can move their finger once contact with screen with precision small mm hand position digit used switching users handheld portable touchscreen devices hold them variety ways routinely change their method holding selection suit position type input there are four basic types handheld interaction holding at least part with both hands tapping with single thumb holding with one hand tapping with finger rarely thumb another hand holding device one hand tapping with thumb from that hand holding with two hands tapping with both thumbs use rates vary widely while two-thumb tapping encountered rarely 1-3% for many general interactions used for 41% typing interaction addition devices are often placed on surfaces desks tables tablets especially are used stands user may point select gesture these cases with their finger thumb also varies use combined with haptics touchscreens are often used with haptic response systems common example this technology vibratory feedback provided when button on touchscreen tapped haptics are used improve user's experience with touchscreens by providing simulated tactile feedback can be designed react immediately partly countering on-screen response latency research from university glasgow scotland demonstrates that sample users reduce input errors 20% increase input speed 20% lower their cognitive load 40% when touchscreens are combined with haptics tactile feedback gorilla arm extended use gestural interfaces without ability user rest their arm referred gorilla arm can result fatigue even repetitive stress injury when routinely used work setting certain early pen-based interfaces required operator work this position for much work day allowing user rest their hand arm on input device frame around solution for this many contexts this phenomenon often cited prima facie example what not do ergonomics unsupported touchscreens are still fairly common applications such atms data kiosks but are not issue typical user only engages for brief widely spaced periods fingerprints fingerprints smudges on tablet computer touchscreen touchscreens can suffer from problem fingerprints on display this can be mitigated by use materials with optical coatings designed reduce visible effects fingerprint oils oleophobic coatings most modern smartphones which lessen actual amount oil residue which includes alcohol by installing matte-finish anti-glare screen protector which creates slightly roughened surface that does not easily retain smudges see also dual-touchscreen pen computing energy harvesting flexible keyboard
