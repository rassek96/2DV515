personnel using vr parachute training simulator research has been done on learning virtual reality its immersive qualities may enhance learning vr used by trainers provide learners with virtual environment where they can develop their skills without real-world consequences failing thomas furness iii was one first develop use vr for military training when he presented air force with his first working model virtual flight simulator he called visually coupled airborne systems simulator vcass by time he started his work on vcass aircraft were becoming increasingly complicated handle virtual reality provided better solution previous training methods furness attempted incorporate his knowledge human visual auditory processing create virtual interface that was more intuitive use second phase his project which he called super cockpit was even more advanced with high resolution graphics for time responsive display furness often credited pioneer virtual reality for this research vr plays important role combat training for military allows recruits train under controlled environment where they are respond different types combat situations fully immersive virtual reality that uses head-mounted display hmd data suits data glove vr weapon are used train for combat this setup allows training's reset time be cut down allows more repetition shorter amount time fully immersive training environment allows soldiers train through wide variety terrains situations scenarios headscreen-wearing soldier sits at gunner station while learning virtual training suite vr also used flight simulation for air force where people are trained be pilots simulator would sit on top hydraulic lift system that reacts user inputs events when pilot steer aircraft module would turn tilt accordingly provide haptic feedback flight simulator can range from fully enclosed module series computer monitors providing pilot's point view most important reasons on using simulators over learning with real aircraft are reduction transference time between land training real flight safety economy absence pollution by same token virtual driving simulations are used train tank drivers on basics before allowing them operate real vehicle finally same goes for truck driving simulators which belgian firemen are for example trained drive way that prevents much damage possible these drivers often have less experience than other truck drivers virtual reality training allows them compensate this near future similar projects are expected for all drivers priority vehicles including police medical
