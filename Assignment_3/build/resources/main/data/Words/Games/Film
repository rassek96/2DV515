one on top other projected together then moving slide would be hand-operated either directly by means lever other mechanism chromotrope slides which produced eye-dazzling displays continuously cycling abstract geometrical patterns colors were operated by means small crank pulley wheel that rotated glass disc mid-19th century inventions such joseph plateau's phenakistoscope later zoetrope demonstrated that carefully designed sequence drawings showing phases changing appearance objects motion would appear show objects actually moving if they were displayed one after other at sufficiently rapid rate these devices relied on phenomenon persistence vision make display appear continuous even though observer's view was actually blocked each drawing rotated into location where its predecessor had just been glimpsed each sequence was limited small number drawings usually twelve so could only show endlessly repeating cyclical motions by late 1880s last major device this type praxinoscope had been elaborated into form that employed long coiled band containing hundreds images painted on glass used elements magic lantern project them onto screen use sequences photographs such devices was initially limited few experiments with subjects photographed series poses because available emulsions were not sensitive enough allow short exposures needed photograph subjects that were actually moving sensitivity was gradually improved late 1870s eadweard muybridge created first animated image sequences photographed real-time row cameras was used each turn capturing one image on photographic glass plate so total number images each sequence was limited by number cameras about two dozen at most muybridge used his system analyze movements wide variety animal human subjects hand-painted images based on photographs were projected moving images by means his zoopraxiscope shot from georges méliès le voyage dans la lune trip moon early narrative film also early science

only one lens allowed several minutes action be captured stored on single compact reel film some early films were made be viewed by one person at time through peep show device such kinetoscope others were intended for projector mechanically similar camera sometimes actually same machine which was used shine intense light through processed printed film into projection lens so that these moving pictures could be shown tremendously enlarged on screen for viewing by entire audience first public screenings films at which admission was charged was made by american woodville latham his sons using films produced by their company by - arguably better known - french brothers auguste louis lumière with ten their own productions private screenings had preceded these by several months with latham's slightly predating lumière brothers' another opinion that first public exhibition projected motion pictures america was at koster bial's music hall new york city on 23rd april early evolution earliest films were simply one static shot that showed event action with no editing other cinematic techniques around turn 20th century films started stringing several scenes together tell story scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances angles other techniques such camera movement were developed effective ways tell story with film until sound film became commercially practical late 1920s motion pictures were purely visual art but these innovative silent films had gained hold on public imagination rather than leave audiences with only noise projector accompaniment theater owners hired pianist organist large urban theaters full orchestra play music that fit mood film at any given moment by early 1920s most films came with prepared list sheet music be used for this purpose complete film scores were composed for major productions play media clip from charlie chaplin silent film bond rise european cinema was interrupted by outbreak world war i

eisenstein f w murnau fritz lang many ways inspired by meteoric wartime progress film through griffith along with contributions charles chaplin buster keaton others quickly caught up with american film-making continued further advance medium sound 1920s development electronic sound recording technologies made practical incorporate soundtrack speech music sound effects synchronized with action on screen resulting sound films were initially distinguished from usual silent moving pictures movies by calling them talking pictures talkies revolution they wrought was swift by silent film was practically extinct us already being referred old medium colour another major technological development was introduction natural color which meant color that was photographically recorded from nature rather than added black-and-white prints by hand-coloring stencil-coloring other arbitrary procedures although earliest processes typically yielded colors which were far from natural appearance while advent sound films quickly made silent films theater musicians obsolete color replaced black-and-white much more gradually pivotal innovation was introduction three-strip version technicolor process first used for animated cartoons then also for live-action short films isolated sequences few feature films then for entire feature film becky sharp expense process was daunting but favorable public response form increased box office receipts usually justified added cost number films made color slowly increased year after year 1950s developments early 1950s proliferation black-and-white television started seriously depressing north american theater attendance attempt lure audiences back into theaters bigger screens were installed widescreen processes polarized projection stereophonic sound were introduced more films were made color which soon became rule rather than exception some important mainstream hollywood films were still being made black-and-white late mid-1960s but they marked end era color television receivers had been available us since mid-1950s but at first they were very expensive few broadcasts were color during 1960s prices gradually came down color broadcasts became common sales boomed overwhelming public verdict favor color was clear after final flurry black-and-white films had been released mid-decade all hollywood studio productions were filmed color with rare exceptions reluctantly made only at insistence star directors such peter bogdanovich martin scorsese 1960s later decades following decline studio system 1960s saw changes production style

film theory this mm spring-wound bolex h16 reflex camera popular entry level camera used film schools main articles film theory philosophy language film analysis film theory seeks develop concise systematic concepts that apply study film art concept film art-form began with ricciotto canudo's birth sixth art formalist film theory led by rudolf arnheim béla balázs siegfried kracauer emphasized how film differed from reality thus could be considered valid fine art andré bazin reacted against this theory by arguing that film's artistic essence lay its ability mechanically reproduce reality not its differences from reality this gave rise realist theory more recent analysis spurred by jacques lacan's psychoanalysis ferdinand de saussure's semiotics among other things has given rise psychoanalytic film theory structuralist film theory feminist film theory others on other hand critics from analytical philosophy tradition influenced by wittgenstein try clarify misconceptions used theoretical studies produce analysis film's vocabulary its link form life language film considered have its own language james monaco wrote classic text on film theory titled how read film that addresses this director ingmar bergman famously said andrei tarkovsky for me greatest director one who invented new language true nature film captures life reflection life dream example language

flashbacks his youth his home-life with added special effects placed into film after filming complete these were all filmed separately perhaps with different actors final version called montage directors developed theory montage beginning with eisenstein complex juxtaposition images his film battleship potemkin incorporation musical visual counterpoint scene development through mise en scene editing effects has led more complex techniques comparable those used opera ballet criticism main article film criticism film criticism analysis evaluation films general these works can be divided into two categories academic criticism by film scholars journalistic film criticism that appears regularly newspapers other media film critics working for newspapers magazines broadcast media mainly review new releases normally they only see any given film once have only day two formulate their opinions despite this critics have important impact on audience response attendance at films especially those certain genres mass marketed action horror comedy films tend not be greatly affected by critic's overall judgment film plot summary description film assessment director's screenwriters' work that makes up majority most film reviews can still have important impact on whether people decide see film for prestige films such most dramas art films influence reviews important poor reviews from leading critics at major papers magazines will often reduce audience interest attendance impact reviewer on given film's box office performance matter debate some observers claim that movie marketing 2000s so intense well-coordinated well financed that reviewers cannot prevent poorly written filmed blockbuster from attaining market success however cataclysmic failure some heavily promoted films which were harshly reviewed well unexpected success critically praised independent films indicates that extreme critical reactions can have considerable influence other observers note that positive film reviews have been shown spark interest little-known films conversely there have been several films which film companies have so little confidence that they refuse give reviewers advanced viewing avoid widespread panning film however this usually backfires reviewers are wise tactic warn public that film may not be worth seeing films often do poorly result journalist film critics are sometimes called film reviewers critics who take more academic approach films through publishing film journals writing books about films using film theory film studies approaches study how film filming techniques work what effect they have on people rather than having their reviews published newspapers appearing on television their articles are published scholarly journals up-market magazines they also tend be affiliated with colleges universities professors instructors industry world cinema african cinema asian cinema east asian cinema south asian cinema southeast asian cinema west asian cinema european cinema latin american cinema north american cinema oceanian cinema main article film industry babelsberg studio near berlin was first large-scale film studio world founded forerunner hollywood still produces global blockbusters every year making showing motion pictures became source profit almost soon process was invented upon seeing how successful their new invention its product

enough found local entrepreneurs various countries europe buy their equipment photograph export import screen additional product commercially oberammergau passion play was first commercial motion picture ever produced other pictures soon followed motion pictures became separate industry that overshadowed vaudeville world dedicated theaters companies formed specifically produce distribute films while motion picture actors became major celebrities commanded huge fees for their performances by charlie chaplin had contract that called for annual salary one million dollars from film was also only image storage playback system for television programming until introduction videotape recorders united states much film industry centered around hollywood california other regional centers exist many parts world such mumbai-centered bollywood indian film industry's hindi cinema which produces largest number films world though expense involved making films has led cinema production concentrate under auspices movie studios recent advances affordable film making equipment have allowed independent film productions flourish profit key force industry due costly risky nature filmmaking many films

countries place where movies are exhibited may be called cinema movie theatre by contrast united states movie predominant form although words film movie are sometimes used interchangeably film more often used when considering artistic theoretical technical aspects term movies more often refers entertainment commercial aspects where go for fun evening on date for example book titled how undertand film would probably be about aesthetics theory film while book entitled let's go movies would probably be about history entertaining movies blockbusters further terminology used distinguish various forms media used film industry motion pictures moving pictures are frequently used terms for film movie productions specifically intended for theatrical exhibition such for instance batman dvd videotape are video formats that can reproduce photochemical film reproduction based on such called transfer after advent theatrical film industry television industry began using videotape recording medium for many decades tape was solely analog medium onto which moving images could be either recorded transferred film filming refer photochemical medium that chemically records visual image act recording respectively however act shooting images with other visual media such with digital camera still called filming resulting works often called films interchangeable movies despite not being shot on film silent films need not be utterly silent but are films movies without audible dialogue including those that have musical accompaniment word talkies refers earliest sound films created have audible dialogue recorded for playback along with film regardless musical accompaniment cinema either broadly encompasses both films movies roughly synonymous with film theatrical exhibition both are capitalized when referring category art silver screen refers projection screen used exhibit films by extension also used metonym for entire film industry widescreen refers larger width height frame compared earlier historic aspect ratios feature-length film feature film conventional full length usually minutes more can commercially stand by itself without other films ticketed screening short film that not long feature-length film often screened with other shorts preceding feature-length film independent film made outside conventional film industry us usage one talks screening projection movie video on screen at public private theater british english film showing happens at cinema never theatre which different medium place altogether cinema usually refers arena designed specifically exhibit films where screen affixed wall while theater usually refers place where live non-recorded action combination thereof occurs from podium other type stage including amphitheater theaters can still screen movies them though theater would be retrofitted do so one might propose going cinema when referring activity sometimes pictures british english whereas us expression usually going movies cinema usually shows mass-marketed movie using front-projection screen process with either film projector more recently with digital projector but cinemas may also show theatrical movies from their home video transfers that include blu-ray disc dvd videocassette when they possess sufficient projection quality based upon need such movies that exist only their transferred state which may be due loss deterioration film master prints from which movie originally existed due advent digital film production distribution physical film might be absent entirely double feature screening two independently marketed stand-alone feature films viewing watching film sales at box office refer tickets sold at theater more currently rights sold for individual showings release distribution often simultaneous screening film preview screening advance main release any film may also have sequel which portrays events following those film bride frankenstein early example when there are more films than one with same characters story arcs subject themes these movies become series such james bond series existing outside specific story timeline usually does not exclude film from being part series film that portrays events occurring earlier timeline with those another film but released after that film sometimes called prequel example being butch sundance early days credits end credits list that gives credit people involved production film films from before 1970s usually start film with credits often ending with only title card saying end some equivalent often equivalent that depends on language production from then onward film's credits usually appear at end most films however films with credits that end film often repeat some credits at near start film therefore appear twice such that film's acting leads while less frequently some appearing near at beginning only appear there not at end which often happens director's credit credits appearing at near beginning film are usually called titles beginning titles post-credits scene scene shown after end credits ferris bueller's day off has post-credit scene which ferris tells audience that film over they should go home film's cast refers collection actors actresses who appear star film star actor actress often popular one many cases celebrity who plays central character film occasionally word can also be used refer fame other members crew such director other personality such martin scorsese crew usually interpreted people involved film's physical construction outside cast participation could include directors film

film buff person who likes often attends films movies any these though more often latter could also see oneself student films movies filmic process intense interest films film theory film criticism known cinephilia cinéaste french preview main article test screening preview performance refers showing film select audience usually for purposes corporate promotions before public film premiere itself previews are sometimes used judge audience reaction which if unexpectedly negative may result recutting even refilming certain sections based on audience response one example film that was changed after negative response from test screening was 1982's first blood after test audience responded very negatively death protagonist john rambo vietnam veteran at end film company wrote re-shot new ending which character survives trailer teaser main article film trailer trailers previews are advertisements for films that will be shown months at cinema back early days cinema with theaters that had only one two screens only certain trailers were shown for films that were going be shown there later when theaters added more screens new theaters were built with lot screens all different trailers were shown even if they weren't going play that film that theater film studios realized that more trailers that were shown even if wasn't going be shown that particular theater more patrons would go different theater see film when came out term trailer comes from their having originally been shown at end film program that practice did not last long because patrons tended leave theater after films ended but name has stuck trailers are now shown before film film double feature program begins film trailers are also common on dvds blu-ray discs well on internet mobile devices trailers are created be engaging interesting for viewers result internet era viewers often seek out trailers watch them ten billion videos watched online annually film trailers ranked third after news user-created videos teasers are much shorter preview advertisement that lasts only seconds teasers are used get patrons excited about film coming out next six twelve months teasers may be produced even before film production completed education propaganda main articles educational film propaganda film film used for range goals including education propaganda when purpose primarily educational film called educational film examples are recordings academic lectures experiments film based on classic novel film may be propaganda whole part such films made by leni riefenstahl nazi germany us war film trailers during world war ii artistic films made under stalin by eisenstein they may also be works political protest films wajda more subtly films andrei tarkovsky same film may be considered educational by some propaganda by others categorization film can be subjective production main article filmmaking at its core means produce film depend on content filmmaker wishes show apparatus for displaying zoetrope merely requires series images on strip paper film production can therefore take little one person with camera even without camera stan brakhage's film mothlight thousands actors extras crewmembers for live-action feature-length epic necessary steps for almost any film can be boiled down conception planning execution revision distribution more involved production more significant each steps becomes typical production cycle hollywood-style film these main stages are defined development pre-production production post-production distribution this production cycle usually takes three years first year taken up with development second year comprises preproduction production third year post-production distribution bigger production more resources takes more important financing becomes most feature films are artistic works from creators' perspective eg film director cinematographer screenwriter for-profit business entities for production companies crew main article film crew film crew group people hired by film company employed during production photography phase for purpose producing film motion picture crew are distinguished from cast who are actors who appear front camera provide voices for characters film crew interacts with but also distinct from production staff consisting producers managers company representatives their assistants those whose primary responsibility falls pre-production post-production phases such screenwriters film editors communication between production crew generally passes through director his/her staff assistants medium-to-large crews are generally divided into departments with well defined hierarchies standards for interaction cooperation between departments other than acting crew handles everything photography phase props costumes shooting sound electrics ie lights sets production special effects caterers known film industry craft services are usually not considered part crew technology see also cinematic techniques film stock consists transparent celluloid acetate polyester base coated with emulsion containing light-sensitive chemicals cellulose nitrate was first type film base used record motion pictures but due its flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials stock widths film format for images on reel have had rich history though most large commercial films are still shot on distributed theaters mm prints originally moving picture film was shot projected at various speeds using hand-cranked cameras projectors though frames per minute 16⅔ frame/s generally cited standard silent speed research indicates most films were shot between frame/s frame/s projected from frame/s on up often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should be shown when sound film was introduced late 1920s constant speed was required for sound head frames per second was chosen because was slowest thus cheapest speed which allowed for sufficient sound quality improvements since late 19th century include mechanization cameras – allowing them record at consistent speed quiet camera design – allowing sound recorded on-set be usable without requiring large blimps encase camera invention more sophisticated filmstocks lenses allowing directors film increasingly dim conditions development synchronized sound allowing sound be recorded at exactly same speed its corresponding action soundtrack can be recorded separately from shooting film but for live-action pictures many parts soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously medium film not limited motion pictures since technology developed basis for photography can be used present progressive sequence still images form slideshow film has also been incorporated into multimedia presentations often has importance primary historical documentation however historic films have problems terms preservation storage motion picture industry exploring many alternatives most films on cellulose nitrate base have been copied onto modern safety films some studios save color films through use separation masters three b&w negatives each exposed through red green blue filters essentially reverse technicolor process digital methods have also been used restore films although their continued obsolescence cycle makes them poor choice for long-term preservation film preservation decaying film stock matter concern both film historians archivists companies interested preserving their existing products order make them available future generations thereby increase revenue preservation generally higher concern for nitrate single-strip color films due their high decay rates black-and-white films on safety bases color films preserved on technicolor imbibition prints tend keep up much better assuming proper handling storage some films recent decades have been recorded using analog video technology similar that used television production modern digital video cameras digital projectors are gaining ground well these approaches are preferred by some film-makers especially because footage shot with digital cinema can be evaluated edited with non-linear editing systems nle without waiting for film stock be processed migration was gradual most major motion pictures were still shot on film independent main article independent film lumière brothers were first filmmakers such they made their films independents without support from studio at that time major film studios did not exist independent filmmaking often takes place outside hollywood other major studio systems independent film indie film film initially produced without financing distribution from major film studio creative business technological reasons have all contributed growth indie film scene late 20th early 21st century on business side costs big-budget studio films also leads conservative choices cast crew there trend hollywood towards co-financing over two-thirds films put out by warner bros were joint ventures up from 10% hopeful director almost never given opportunity get job on big-budget studio film unless he she has significant industry experience film television also studios rarely produce films with unknown actors particularly lead roles before advent digital alternatives cost professional film equipment stock was also hurdle being able produce direct star traditional studio film but advent consumer camcorders more importantly arrival high-resolution digital video early 1990s have lowered technology barrier film production significantly both production post-production costs have been significantly lowered 2000s hardware software for post-production can be installed commodity-based personal computer technologies such dvds firewire connections wide variety professional consumer-grade video editing software make film-making relatively affordable since introduction digital video dv technology means production have become more democratized filmmakers can conceivably shoot film with digital video camera edit film create edit sound music mix final cut on high-end home computer however while means production may be democratized financing distribution marketing remain difficult accomplish outside traditional system most independent filmmakers rely on film festivals get their films noticed sold for distribution arrival internet-based video websites such youtube veoh has further changed film making landscape enabling indie filmmakers make their films available public open content film main article open content film open content film much like
