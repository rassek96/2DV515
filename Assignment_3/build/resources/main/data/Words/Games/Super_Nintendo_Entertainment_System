playstation saturn according nintendo company had sold more than million snes units us according wedbush securities report based on npd sales data snes ultimately outsold genesis us market changes policy during nes era nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles released for system—the company had approve every game each third-party developer could only release up five games per year but some third parties got around this by using different names for example konami's ultra games brand those games could not be released on another console within two years nintendo was exclusive manufacturer supplier nes cartridges however competition from sega's console brought end this practice acclaim began releasing games for both platforms with most nintendo's other licensees following suit over next several years capcom which licensed some games sega instead producing them directly square were most notable holdouts company continued carefully review submitted titles giving them scores using 40-point scale allocating nintendo's marketing resources accordingly each region performed separate evaluations nintendo america also maintained policy that among other things limited amount violence games on its systems one game mortal kombat would challenge this policy surprise hit arcades mortal kombat features splashes blood finishing moves that often depict one character dismembering other because genesis version retained gore while snes version did not outsold snes version by ratio three four-to-one game players were not only ones notice violence this game us

increasing shortage necessary parts technical specifications 16-bit design snes incorporates graphics sound co-processors that allow tiling simulated effects palette colors 8-channel adpcm audio these base platform features plus ability dramatically extend them all through substantial chip upgrades inside each cartridge represent leap over 8-bit nes generation some supposed significant advantages over 16-bit competitors such genesis regional lockout nintendo employed several types regional lockout including both physical hardware incompatibilities cartridge shape comparison top north american design bottom japanese pal region design ------------------------------------------------------------------------ bottom cartridge also illustrates optional pins used by enhancement chips such super fx chip on physical level cartridges are shaped differently for different regions north american cartridges have rectangular bottom with inset grooves matching protruding tabs console while other regions' cartridges are narrower with smooth curve on front no grooves physical incompatibility can be overcome with use various adapters through modification console internally regional lockout chip cic within console each cartridge prevents pal region games from being played on japanese north american consoles vice versa japanese north american machines have same region chip this can be overcome through use adapters typically by inserting imported cartridge one slot cartridge with correct region chip second slot alternatively disconnecting one pin console's lockout chip will prevent from locking console hardware later games can detect this situation so later became common install switch reconnect lockout chip needed pal consoles face another incompatibility when playing out-of-region cartridges ntsc video standard specifies video at hz while pal operates at hz resulting approximately 167% slower framerate additionally pal's higher resolution results letterboxing output image some commercial pal region releases exhibit this same problem therefore can be played ntsc systems without issue while others will face 20% speedup if played ntsc console mostly correct this issue switch can be added place snes ppu into hz mode supported by most newer pal televisions later games will detect this setting refuse run requiring switch be thrown only after check completes casing japanese
