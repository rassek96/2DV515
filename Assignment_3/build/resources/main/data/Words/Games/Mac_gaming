mac gaming websites references external links early game development on mac prior release first macintosh computer number marketing executives at apple were concerned that including game finished operating system would aggravate impression that graphical user interface made mac toy-like more critically limited amount ram original macintosh meant that fitting game into operating system would be very difficult eventually andy hertzfeld created desk accessory called puzzle that occupied only bytes memory this was deemed small enough be safely included operating system shipped with mac when released with puzzle—the first computer game specifically for mouse—the macintosh became first computer with game its rom would remain part mac os for next ten years until being replaced with jigsaw jigsaw puzzle game included part system during development mac chess game similar archon based on alice wonderland was shown development team game was written by steve capps for apple lisa computer but could be easily ported macintosh completed game was shown at mac's launch released few months later under title through looking glass but apple failed put much marketing effort into ensuring its success game was not top seller by mid-1980s most computer companies avoided term home computer because its association with image compute wrote low-powered low-end machine primarily suited for playing games apple's john sculley for example denied that his company sold home computers rather he said apple sold computers for use home company reportedly refused support joysticks on its low-cost macintosh lc iisi computers prevent customers from considering them game machines game development on macintosh nonetheless continued with titles such dark castle microsoft flight simulator simcity though mostly games for mac were developed alongside those for other platforms notable exceptions were myst developed on mac part using hypercard only afterwards ported windows pathways into darkness which spawned halo franchise journeyman project lunicus spaceship warlock jump raven apple was first manufacturer ship cd-rom drives standard equipment on macintosh iivx later centris models many early cd-rom based games were initially developed for mac especially era often confusing multimedia pc standards pippin apple pippin also known bandai pippin was multimedia player based on power mac that ran cut-down version mac os designed among other things play games sold between japan united states was not commercial success with fewer than units sold fewer than thousand games software applications supported attempts by apple promote gaming on mac ] this section needs expansion you can help by adding october apple has at times attempted market platform for gaming april steve jobs gave interview with uk-based arcade magazine promote powerpc g3-based computers apple were selling with then new ati rage graphics cards describing how apple was trying build best gaming platform world so developers are attracted write for trying leapfrog pc industry original mac games although currently most big-name mac games are ports this has not always been case perhaps most popular game which was originally developed for macintosh was 1993's myst by cyan was ported windows next year cyan's later games were released simultaneously for both platforms with exception uru ages beyond myst which was windows-only until mac-compatible re-release currently beta by gametap with help transgaming's cider virtualization software from 1980s atmospheric air hockey game shufflepuck café brøderbund graphical adventure game shadowgate mindscape were among most prominent games developed first for macintosh later ported for other platforms another popular mac game was marathon series first-person shooters these games were released wake popular doom which defined first-person shooter genre but contained many innovations new uncommon similar games from time such weapons with two functions ability for player look fire up down swim through liquids fight alongside allied characters wield two weapons at once bungie studios would port second series marathon durandal windows platform where met with some success they also ported their post-marathon games myth oni windows at macworld conference & expo new york city bungie showed demonstration new game entitled halo be released for mac next year before this happened bungie was purchased by microsoft halo was released exclusively for xbox video game console macintosh windows versions game did not arrive until late almost four half years after its original announcement at macworld today there are many companies both large small creating original games for macintosh however following trend industry these tend be lower-budget casual games with simple graphics that are easy pick up play short bursts opposed high-budget hardcore games that are more graphically intensive require large investments time play master windows games particular problem for companies attempting port windows games macintosh licensing middleware middleware off-the-shelf software that handles certain aspects games making easier for game creators develop games return for paying middleware developer licensing fee however since license mac porting house obtains from game creator does not normally include rights use middleware well mac porting company must either license middleware separately attempt find alternative examples middleware include havok physics engine gamespy internet-based multiplayer gaming client because smaller market companies developing games for mac usually seek lower licensing fee than windows developers when middleware company refuses such terms porting that particular windows game mac may be uneconomical engineering viable alternative within available budget impossible result some popular games which use havok engine have not yet been ported macintosh other cases workaround solutions may be found case gamespy one workaround limit mac gamers play against each other but not with users playing windows version however some cases gamespy has been reverse-engineered implemented into mac game so that able network seamlessly with windows version game in-house porting only few companies have developed continue develop games for both mac windows platforms notable examples these are transgaming aspyr big fish games blizzard entertainment brøderbund linden lab microsoft many ways this ideal situation those creating mac version have direct access original programmers case any questions concerns arise about source code also increases likelihood that mac windows versions game will launch concurrently nearly so many obstacles inherent third-party porting process are avoided another benefit in-house porting if carried out simultaneously with game development that company can release hybrid discs easing game distribution largely eliminating shelf space problem among mac versions popular windows games that were developed in-house are diablo microsoft flight simulator second life stubbs zombie call duty world warcraft third-party porting most high-budget games that come macintosh are originally created for microsoft windows ported mac operating system by one relatively small number porting houses among most notable these are aspyr feral interactive macsoft games red marble games coladia games macplay critical factor for financial viability these porting houses number copies game sold successful title may sell only units licensing deal between original game developer porting house may be flat one-time payment percentage profits from mac game's sale both while this license gives porting house access artwork source code does not normally cover middleware such third-party game engines modifying source code macintosh platform may be difficult code for games often highly optimized for windows operating system intel-compatible processors latter presented obstacle previous years when macintosh platform utilized powerpc processors due difference endianness between two types processors but today's macintosh computers employ intel processors well obstacle has been mitigated somewhat one example common work for porting house converting graphics instructions targeted for microsoft's directx graphics library instructions for opengl library directx favored by most windows game developers but incompatible with macintosh due time involved licensing porting product macintosh versions games ported by third-party companies are usually released anywhere from three months more than year after their windows-based counterparts for example windows version civilization iv was released on october but mac gamers had wait eight months until june for release mac version boot camp april apple released beta version boot camp product which allows intel-based macintoshes boot directly into windows xp windows vista reaction from mac game developers software journalists introduction boot camp has been mixed ranging from assuming mac will be dead platform for game development cautious optimism that mac owners will continue play games within mac os rather than by rebooting windows number mac ports windows games released was never likely be very great despite steadily increasing number mac users emulation virtualization over years there have been number emulators for macintosh that allowed run ms-dos windows software most notably realpc softpc softwindows virtual pc although more less adequate for business applications these programs have tended deliver poor performance when used for running games particularly where high-end technologies like directx were involved since introduction intel processor into macintosh platform windows virtualization software such parallels desktop for mac vmware fusion have been seen more promising solutions for running windows software on mac operating systemin some ways they are better solutions than boot camp they do not require rebooting machine vmware fusion's public beta supports hardware-accelerated graphics which utilize directx library up version parallels desktop for mac version has announced support for gpu acceleration allowing mac users play windows-based games wine-based projects main article wine software transgaming technologies has developed product called cider which popular method among publishers port games mac cider's engine enables publishers developers target mac os x shares much same core technology transgaming's linux portability engine cedega public reception games ported with cider mixed due inconsistency performance between titles because this ciderized games are neither seen work cross-platform development nor native optimized ports both cider cedega are based on wine electronic arts announced their return mac publishing various titles simultaneously on both windows mac using cider open source wine-based project called wineskin allows anyone attempt port games mac os x since uses all open source components open source itself its technology very similar what transgaming does with cider but free use anyone wineskin creates self-contained clickable mac applications out installation wrappers that can be made from this are often shared with friends others legal versions games can then be installed easily into shared wrapper then final result works like normal mac app wineskin mainly only used hobbyist porting not professional porting but some professional game companies have used major releases since end there paulthetallcom app called porting kit which automatically creates ready-to-use wineskin wrappers for some specific games codeweavers' crossover products use compatibility layer translate windows' application instructions native macintosh operating system without need run windows crossover built from wine project adds graphical frontend process installing running windows applications through wine codeweavers active supporter wine routinely shares programming code patches back project playonmac free version same technology also based on wine list wine-compatible windows software including over games how well each individual game works with wine can be found at appdbwinehqorg games are listed platinum which means they work out-of-the-box while more are listed gold meaning they require some tweaking installation run flawlessly shelf space problem one problem afflicting both porting houses original mac game developers that shelf space which refers amount space retail store allocates stocking mac games due its small market share macintosh software whole receives very little if any shelf space most major computer retail stores within that space retailers are usually reluctant stock relatively inexpensive games which may may not sell well opposed high-cost top-selling products such microsoft office adobe photoshop because this most smaller mac game companies release their products using shareware business model either exclusively addition more traditional retail boxed version all porting houses larger game companies have stuck traditional model but recent rise digital download model may lead some companies eventually releasing games paid downloads model similar valve corporation's steam service mmorpgs are largely immune shelf space problem ncsoft's lineage was one first games made available for mac os x virtual programming was one few porting companies offer commercial games via digital download although with launch deliver2mac gamersgate early other companies are beginning move towards digital distribution aside from getting around shelf space problem shareware digital download models also provide larger percentage profit company wholesaler middleman avoided costs turnaround times involved media replication are eliminated latest player transgaming technologies' gametreeonlinecom which was launched march with focus offer mac gaming community digital downloads major published mac titles linux gaming free software games more recent years mac gaming has become more intertwined with gaming on another unix-like platform linux gaming this trend began when linux began gain mac-style porting houses first which was loki software later linux game publishing linux porters born from this new industry have also been commonly hired mac porters often releasing games for both systems this includes game porters like ryan c gordon who brought unreal tournament linux mac companies like hyperion entertainment who primarily supports amigaos well mac linux runesoft german publisher that has done ports for linux game publishing recently mac-focused porter aspyr has also started releasing titles for linux starting with civilization v feral interactive has also released xcom enemy unknown middle-earth shadow mordor for linux indie game development has also been conducive intertwining with developers like wolfire games lugaru overgrowth frictional games penumbra amnesia boy world goo sillysoft games lux basilisk games eschalon supporting both platforms with native versions id software was also pioneer both mac linux gaming with ports their games once done by timothee besset illwinter game design also notable for supporting both platforms open source video games have also proved modestly popular on mac although due free software nature system development free software titles mostly begins on linux afterwards major games are typically ported mac microsoft windows mac has less mainstream games than windows result free games have had more impact on platform notable free games popular on mac include battle for wesnoth openarena bzflag lincity more valve corporation interview with valve corporation's half-life counter-strike team fortress source engine gabe newell included question why his company was keeping their games gaming technology strictly windows project newell answered “ we tried have conversation with apple for several years they never seemed well we have this pattern with apple where we meet with them people there go wow gaming incredibly important we should do something with gaming then we'll say ok here are three things you could do make that better then they say ok then we never see them again then year later new group people show up who apparently have no idea that last group people were there never follow through on anything so they seem think that they want do gaming but there's never any follow through on any things they say they're going do that makes hard be excited about doing games for their platforms ” on february after release public open beta version steam member on steam forums found new files pertaining mac os x program files beta after several days
