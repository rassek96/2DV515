television by analogy term used for raster graphics pattern image storage transmission used most computer bitmap image systems word raster comes from latin word rastrum rake which derived from radere scrape see also rastrum instrument for drawing musical staff lines pattern left by lines rake when drawn straight resembles parallel lines raster this line-by-line scanning what creates raster systematic process covering area progressively one line at time although often great deal faster similar most-general sense how one's gaze travels when one reads lines text contents description o scan lines o scanning pattern o printers o fonts video timing perception theory history o interlaced scanning o radar history see also references description scan lines raster scan image subdivided into sequence usually horizontal strips known scan lines each scan line can be transmitted form analog signal read from video source television systems can be further divided into discrete pixels for processing computer system this ordering pixels by rows known raster order raster scan order analog television has discrete scan lines discrete vertical resolution but does not have discrete pixels horizontal resolution – instead varies signal continuously over scan line thus while number scan lines vertical resolution unambiguously defined horizontal resolution more approximate according how quickly signal can change over course scan line scanning pattern beam position sweeps follow roughly sawtooth wave raster scanning beam sweeps horizontally left-to-right at steady rate then blanks rapidly moves back left where turns back on sweeps out next line during this time vertical position also steadily increasing downward but much more slowly – there one vertical sweep per image frame but one horizontal sweep per line resolution thus each scan line sloped slightly downhill towards lower right with slope approximately –1/horizontal resolution while sweep back left retrace significantly faster than forward scan essentially horizontal resulting tilt scan lines very small dwarfed effect by screen convexity other modest geometrical imperfections there misconception that once scan line complete crt display effect suddenly jumps internally by analogy with typewriter printer's paper advance line feed before creating next scan line discussed above this does not exactly happen vertical sweep continues at steady rate over scan line creating small tilt steady-rate sweep done instead stairstep advancing every row because steps are hard implement technically while steady-rate much easier resulting tilt compensated most crts by tilt parallelogram adjustments which impose small vertical deflection beam sweeps across screen when properly adjusted this deflection exactly cancels downward slope scanlines horizontal retrace turn slants smoothly downward tilt deflection removed there's no jump at either end retrace detail scanning crts performed by magnetic deflection by changing current coils deflection yoke rapidly changing deflection jump requires voltage spike be applied yoke deflection can only react fast inductance spike magnitude permit electronically inductance deflection yoke's vertical windings relatively high thus current yoke therefore vertical part magnetic deflection field can change only slowly fact spikes do occur both horizontally vertically corresponding horizontal blanking interval vertical blanking interval give deflection currents settle time retrace settle their new value this happens during blanking interval electronics these usually steady-rate movements beam are called sweeps circuits that create currents for deflection yoke voltages for horizontal deflection plates oscilloscope are called sweep circuits these create sawtooth wave steady movement across screen then typically rapid move back other side likewise for vertical sweep furthermore wide-deflection-angle crts need horizontal sweeps with current that changes proportionally faster toward center because center screen closer deflection yoke than edges linear change current would swing beams at constant rate angularly this would cause horizontal compression toward center printers computer printers create their images basically by raster scanning laser printers use spinning polygonal mirror optical equivalent scan across photosensitive drum paper movement provides other scan axis considering typical printer resolution downhill effect minuscule inkjet printers have multiple nozzles their printheads so many dozens hundreds scan lines are written together paper advance prepares for next batch scan lines transforming vector-based data into form required by display printer requires raster image processor rip fonts computer text mostly created from font files that describe outlines each printable character symbol glyph minority are bit maps these outlines have be converted into what are effectively little rasters one per character before being rendered displayed printed text effect merging their little rasters into that for page video timing detail each line horizontal frame hframe consists scanline when beam unblanked moving steadily right front porch when beam blanked moving steadily right sync pulse when beam blanked moves rapidly back left back porch when beam blanked again moving steadily right porches associated blanking are provide fall time settle time for beam move back left voltage decrease for ringing die down vertical frame vframe consists exactly same components but only occurs once per image frame times are considerably longer details these intervals are called video timing see video timing details revealed for diagram these these are mostly not visible end users but were visible case xfree86 modelines where users xfree86 could sometimes needed manually adjust these timings particularly achieve certain resolutions refresh rates perception raster scan on crts produces both impression steady image from single scanning point only one point being drawn at time through several technical psychological processes these images then produce impression motion largely same way film – high enough frame rate still images yields impression motion – though raster scans differ few respects particularly interlacing firstly due phosphor persistence even though only one pixel being drawn at time recall that on analog display pixel ill-defined there are no fixed horizontal divisions rather there flying spot by time whole screen has been painted initial pixel still relatively illuminated its brightness will have dropped some which can cause perception flicker this one reason for use interlacing – since only every other line drawn single field broadcast video bright newly-drawn lines interlaced with somewhat dimmed older drawn lines create relatively more even illumination second by persistence vision viewed image persists for moment on retina perceived relatively steady by related flicker fusion threshold these pulsating pixels appear steady these perceptually steady still images are then pieced together produce moving picture similar movie projector however one must bear mind that film projectors full image projected at once not raster scan uninterlaced based on frame rate frames per second by contrast raster scanned interlaced video produces image fields per second field being every other line thus corresponding frame rate frames per second with each field being drawn pixel at time rather than entire image at once these both produce video but yield somewhat different perceptions feel theory history cathode ray tube crt display when electron beams are unblanked horizontal deflection component magnetic field created by deflection yoke makes beams scan forward from left right at constant rate data for consecutive pixels goes at pixel clock rate digital-to-analog converters for each three primary colors for modern flat-panel displays however pixel data remains digital scan line drawn at right edge display all beams are blanked but magnetic field continues increase magnitude for short while after blanking clear up possible confusion referring magnetic deflection fields if there were none all beams would hit screen near center farther away from center greater strength field needed fields one polarity move beam up left those opposite polarity move down right at some point near center magnetic deflection field zero so therefore scan begins field decreases midway passes through zero smoothly increases again complete scan after one line has been created on screen beams are blanked magnetic field reaches its designed maximum relative time required for forward scan then changes back relatively quickly what's required position beam beyond left edge visible unblanked area this process occurs with all beams blanked called retrace at left edge field steadily decreases magnitude start another forward scan soon after start beams unblank start new visible scan line similar process occurs for vertical scan but at display refresh rate typically hz complete field starts with polarity that would place beams beyond top visible area with vertical component deflection field at maximum after some tens horizontal scans but with beams blanked vertical component unblank combined with horizontal unblank permits beams show first scan line once last scan line written vertical component magnetic field continues increase by equivalent few percent total height before vertical retrace takes place vertical retrace comparatively slow occurring over span time required for several tens horizontal scans analog crt tvs setting brightness maximum typically made vertical retrace visible zigzag lines on picture analog tv originally was too costly create simple sequential raster scan type just described with fast-enough refresh rate sufficient horizontal resolution although french 819-line system had better definition than other standards its time obtain flicker-free display analog tv used variant scheme moving-picture film projectors which each frame film shown twice three times do that shutter closes opens again increase flicker rate but not data update rate interlaced scanning main article interlaced video reduce flicker analog crt tvs write only odd-numbered scan lines on first vertical scan then even-numbered lines follow placed interlaced between odd-numbered lines this called interlaced scanning this case positioning even-numbered lines does require precise position control old analog tvs trimming vertical hold adjustment made scan lines space properly if slightly misadjusted scan lines would appear pairs with spaces between modern high-definition tv displays use data formats like progressive scan computer monitors such 1080p lines progressive interlaced such 1080i radar raster scans have been used naval gun fire-control radar although they were typically narrow rectangles they were used pairs for bearing for elevation each display one axis was angular offset from line sight other range radar returns brightened video search weather radars have circular display plan position indicator ppi that covers round screen but this not technically raster analog ppis have sweeps that move outward from center angle sweep matches antenna rotation up being north bow ship history

patent paul nipkow term raster was used for halftone printing screen pattern early similar terminology was used german at least from eder writes die herstellung von rasternegativen für zwecke der autotypie production raster negatives for halftones max dieckmann gustav glage were first produce actual raster images on cathode-ray tube crt they patented their techniques germany has not been determined whether they used word raster their patent other writings early use term raster with respect image scanning via rotating drum arthur korn's book which says german als rasterbild auf metall solcher weise aufgetragen dass die hellen töne metallisch rein sind oder umgekehrt raster image laid out on metal such way that bright tones are metallically pure vice versa korn was applying
