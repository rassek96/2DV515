computing platforms cross-platform software may be divided into two types one requires individual building compilation for each platform that supports other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation eg software written interpreted language pre-compiled portable bytecode for which interpreters run-time packages are common standard components all platforms for example cross-platform application may run on microsoft windows on x86 architecture linux on x86 architecture mac os x on either powerpc x86-based apple macintosh systems cross-platform programs may run on many all existing platforms on few two platforms contents platforms o hardware platforms o software platforms + java platform cross-platform software o web applications + design strategies + testing strategies o traditional applications + binary software + scripts interpreted languages o video games + cross-platform play cross-platform programming o approaches cross-platform programming o cross-platform programming toolkits environments challenges cross-platform development see also references platforms main article platform computing platform can refer type processorcpu other hardware on which given operating system application runs type operating system on computer combination type hardware type operating system running on example common platform microsoft windows running on x86 architecture other well-known desktop computer platforms include linux/unix mac os x - both which are themselves cross-platform there are however many devices such smartphones that are also effectively computer platforms but less commonly thought about that way application software can be written depend on features particular platform—either hardware operating system virtual machine runs on java platform virtual machine platform which runs on many operating systems hardware types common platform for software be written for hardware platforms hardware platform can refer computer’s architecture processor architecture for example x86 architecture its variants such ia-32 x86-64 these machines often run one version microsoft windows though they can run other operating systems well including linux openbsd netbsd mac os x freebsd 32-bit arm architecture newer 64-bit version common on smartphones tablet computers which run android ios other mobile operating systems software platforms software platforms can either be operating system programming environment though more commonly combination both notable exception this java which uses operating system independent virtual machine for its compiled code known world java bytecode examples software platforms include blackberry android for smartphones tablet computers x86 arm ios arm microsoft windows x86 arm o cli also known by implementation names net framework from microsoft cross-platform variant mono previously by novell now by xamarin java web browsers – more less compatible with each other running javascript web-apps linux x86 powerpc arm other architectures os x x86 powerpc on below solaris sparc x86 playstation x86 playstation powerpc based playstation vita arm minor/historical amigaos m68k amigaos powerpc aros x86 powerpc m68k morphos powerpc bsd many platforms see netbsd for example dos-type systems on x86 ms-dos ibm pc dos dr-dos freedos os/2 ecomstation java platform main article java platform previously noted java platform exception general rule that operating system software platform java language typically compiles virtual machine virtual cpu which runs all code that written for language this enables same executable binary run on all systems that implement java virtual machine jvm java programs can be executed natively using java processor this isn't common mostly used for embedded systems java code running jvm has access os-related services like disk i/o network access if appropriate privileges are granted jvm makes system calls on behalf java application this setup allows users decide appropriate protection level depending on acl for example disk network access usually enabled for desktop applications but not for browser-based applets jni can also be used enable access operating system specific functions currently java standard edition programs can run on microsoft windows mac os x several unix-like operating systems several more non-unix-like operating systems like embedded systems for mobile applications browser plugins are used for windows mac based devices android has built-in support for java there are also subsets java such java card java platform micro edition designed for resource-constrained devices cross-platform software for piece software be considered cross-platform must be able function on more than one computer architecture operating system developing such program can be time-consuming task because different operating systems have different application programming interfaces api for example linux uses different api for application software than windows does just because particular operating system may run on different computer architectures that does not mean that software written for that operating system will automatically work on all architectures that operating system supports one example august was openofficeorg which did not natively run on amd64 intel lines processors implementing x86-64 standards for computers this has since been changed openofficeorg suite software “mostly” ported these 64-bit systems this also means that just because program written popular programming language such c c++ does not mean will run on all operating systems that support that programming language—or even on same operating system on different architecture web applications web applications are typically described cross-platform because ideally they are accessible from any various web browsers within different operating systems such applications generally employ client–server system architecture vary widely complexity functionality this wide variability significantly complicates goal cross-platform capability which routinely at odds with goal advanced functionality basic web applications perform all most processing from stateless server pass result client web browser all user interaction with application consists simple exchanges data requests server responses these types applications were norm early phases world wide web application development such applications follow simple transaction model identical that serving static web pages today they are still relatively common especially where cross-platform compatibility simplicity are deemed more critical than advanced functionalities prominent examples advanced web applications include web interface gmail a9com google maps website live search service from microsoft such advanced applications routinely depend on additional features found only more recent versions popular web browsers these dependencies include ajax javascript dynamic html svg other components rich internet applications older versions popular web browsers tend lack support for certain features design strategies because competing interests cross-platform compatibility advanced functionality numerous alternative web application design strategies have emerged such strategies include graceful degradation graceful degradation attempts provide same similar functionality all users platforms while diminishing that functionality least common denominator for more limited client browsers for example user attempting use limited-feature browser access gmail may notice that gmail switches basic mode with reduced functionality this differs from other cross-platform techniques which attempt provide equivalent functionality not just adequate functionality across platforms multiple codebases multiple codebase applications maintain distinct codebases for different hardware os platforms with equivalent functionality this obviously requires duplication effort maintaining code but can be worthwhile where amount platform-specific code high single codebase this strategy relies on having one codebase that may be compiled multiple platform-specific formats one technique conditional compilation with this technique code that common all platforms not repeated blocks code that are only relevant certain platforms are made conditional so that they are only interpreted compiled when needed another technique separation functionality which disables functionality not supported by client browsers operating systems while still delivering complete application user see also separation concerns this technique used web development where interpreted code scripting languages can query platform running on execute different blocks conditionally third-party libraries third-party libraries attempt simplify cross-platform capability by hiding complexities client differentiation behind single unified api responsive web design responsive web design rwd web design approach aimed at crafting visual layout sites provide optimal viewing experience—easy reading navigation with minimum resizing panning scrolling—across wide range devices from mobile phones desktop computer monitors little no platform-specific code used with this technique testing strategies one complicated aspect cross-platform web application design need for software testing addition complications mentioned previously there additional restriction that some web browsers prohibit installation different versions same browser on same operating system although there are several development approaches that companies use target multiple platforms all them result software that requires substantial manual effort for testing maintenance across supported platformstechniques such full virtualization are sometimes used workaround for this problem using tools such page object model cross platform tests can be scripted such way that one test case usable for multiple versions app so long different versions have similar user interfaces both versions can be tested at one time with one test case traditional applications although web applications are becoming increasingly popular many computer users still use traditional application software which does not rely on client/web-server architecture distinction between traditional web applications not always unambiguous however because applications have many different features installation methods architectures some these can overlap occur ways that blur distinction nevertheless this simplifying distinction common useful generalization binary software traditionally modern computing application software has been distributed end-users binary file especially executable files executables only support operating system computer architecture that they were built for—which means that making single cross-platform executable would be something massive task generally replaced by offering selection executables for platforms supported for software that distributed binary executable such software written c c++ programmer must build software for each different operating system computer architecture ie must use toolset that translates—transcompiles—a single codebase into multiple binary executables for example firefox open-source web browser available on windows os x both powerpc x86 through what apple inc calls universal binary linux bsd on multiple computer architectures four platforms this case windows os x linux bsd are separate executable distributions although they come from same source code use different toolsets perform different builds may not be sufficient achieve variety working executables for different platforms this case software engineer must port ie amend code be suitable new computer architecture operating system for example program such firefox which already runs on windows on x86 family can be modified re-built run on linux on x86 potentially other architectures well multiple versions code may be stored separate codebases merged into one codebase by conditional compilation see above note that while porting must be accompanied by cross-platform building reverse not case alternative porting cross-platform virtualization allows applications compiled for one cpu operating system run on system with different cpu and/or operating system without modification source code binaries example apple's rosetta which built into intel-based macintosh computers runs applications compiled for previous generation macs that used powerpc cpus another example ibm powervm lx86 which allows linux/x86 applications run unmodified on linux/power operating system scripts interpreted languages script can be considered be cross-platform if its interpreter available on multiple platforms script only uses facilities provided by language that script written python for unix-like system will likely run with little no modification on windows because python also runs on windows there also more than one implementation python that will run same scripts eg ironpython for net framework same goes for many open-source programming languages that are available are scripting languages unlike binary executable files same script can be used on all computers that have software interpret script this because script generally stored plain text text file there may be some issues however such type new line character that sits between lines generally however little no work has be done make script written for one system run on another some quite popular cross-platform scripting interpreted languages are bash – unix shell commonly run on linux other modern unix-like systems well on windows via cygwin posix compatibility layer perl – scripting language first released used for cgi www programming small system administration tasks more php – scripting language most popular use for web applications python – modern scripting language where focus on rapid application development ease-of-writing instead program run-time efficiency ruby – scripting language whose purpose be object-oriented easy read can also be used on web through ruby on rails tcl – dynamic programming language suitable for wide range uses including web desktop applications networking administration testing many more video games cross-platform crossplay term that can also apply video games released on range video game consoles specialized computers dedicated task playing games order populate servers extend lifespan game examples cross-platform video games include 4x4 evolution miner 2049er phantasy star online tomb raider legend nhl series each has been released across variety gaming platforms such wii playstation xbox personal computers pcs mobile devices characteristics particular system may lengthen time taken implement video game across multiple platforms so video game may initially be released on few platforms then later released on remaining platforms typically this situation occurs when new gaming system released because video game developers need acquaint themselves with hardware software associated with new console some games may not become cross-platform because licensing agreements between developers video game console manufacturers that limit development game one particular console example disney could create game with intention release on latest nintendo sony game consoles should disney license game with sony first disney may exchange be required release game solely on sony’s console for short time indefinitely—effectively prohibiting cross-platform release for duration cross-platform play main article cross-platform play several developers have implemented means play games online while using

assault uno rocket league war thunder cross-platform programming cross-platform programming practice actively writing software that will work on more than one platform approaches cross-platform programming there are different ways approaching problem writing cross-platform application program one such approach simply create multiple versions same program different source trees—in other words windows version program might have one set source code files macintosh version might have another while foss nix system might have another while this straightforward approach problem has potential be considerably more expensive development cost development time both especially for corporate entities idea behind this create more than two different programs that have ability behave similarly each other also possible that this means developing cross-platform application will result more problems with bug tracking fixing because two different source trees would have different programmers thus different defects each version another approach that used depend on pre-existing software that hides differences between platforms—called abstraction platform—such that program itself unaware platform running on could be said that such programs are platform agnostic programs that run on java virtual machine jvm are built this fashion some applications mix various methods cross-platform programming create final application example this firefox web browser which uses abstraction build some lower-level components separate source subtrees for implementing platform-specific features like gui implementation more than one scripting language help facilitate ease portability firefox implements xul css javascript for extending browser addition classic netscape -style browser plugins much

cross-platform development some these include testing cross-platform applications may be considerably more complicated since different platforms can exhibit slightly different behaviors subtle bugs this problem has led some developers deride cross-platform development write once debug everywhere take on sun microsystems' write once run anywhere marketing slogan developers are often restricted using lowest common denominator subset features which are available on all platforms this may hinder application's performance prohibit developers from using platforms’ most advanced features different platforms often have different user interface conventions which cross-platform applications do not always accommodate for example applications developed for mac os x gnome are supposed place most important button on right-hand side window dialog whereas microsoft windows kde have opposite convention though many these differences are subtle cross-platform application which does not conform appropriately these conventions may feel clunky alien user when working quickly such opposing conventions may even result data loss such dialog box confirming whether user wants save discard changes file scripting languages virtual machines must be translated into native executable code each time application executed imposing performance penalty this penalty can be alleviated using advanced techniques like just-in-time compilation but even using such techniques some computational overhead may be unavoidable different platforms require use native package formats such rpm msi multi-platform installers such installanywhere address this need cross-platform execution environments may suffer cross-platform security flaws creating fertile environment for cross-platform malware
