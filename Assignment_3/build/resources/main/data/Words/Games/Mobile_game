hp-41c few other games exist for earliest programmable calculators including hewlett-packard 9100a one first scientific calculators including long-popular lunar lander game often used early programming exercise however limited program address space lack easy program storage made calculator gaming rarity even programmables became cheap relatively easy obtain wasn't until early 1990s when graphing calculators became more powerful cheap enough be common among high school students for use mathematics new graphing calculators with their ability transfer files one another from computer for backup could double game consoles calculators such hp-48 ti-82 could be programmed proprietary programming languages such rpl programming language ti-basic directly on calculator programs could also

networks including openfeint now defunct facebook some companies use regular turn based system where end results are posted so all players can see who won tournament other companies take screen recordings live players broadcast them other players at later point time allow players feel that they are always interacting with another human opponent infrared older mobile phones supporting mobile
