code indicating pdip packaging surface-mounted 74hc595 shift registers on pcb this ic actually high-speed cmos circuit if product code had been 74hct595 would have been compatible with ttl signalling levels series transistor–transistor logic ttl integrated circuits are most popular family ttl integrated circuit logic quickly replacing diode–transistor logic was used build mini mainframe computers 1960s 1970s several generations pin-compatible descendants original family have since become de facto standard electronic components contents overview series derivative families history part numbering scheme second sources europe eastern bloc see also references external links overview series contains hundreds devices that provide everything from basic logic gates flip-flops counters special purpose bus transceivers arithmetic logic units alu specific functions are described list series integrated circuits today surface-mounted cmos versions series are used various applications electronics for glue logic computers industrial electronics original through-hole devices dual in-line packages dip/dil which were mainstay industry for many decades are very useful for rapid breadboard-prototyping education so remain available from most manufacturers fastest types very low voltage versions are typically surface-mount only however first part number series designates device containing four two-input nand gates each gate uses two pins for input one pin for its output remaining two contacts supply power v connect ground this part was made various packages including flat pack plastic ceramic dual in-line packages with pins surface mount packages well additional numbers letters full part number identify package other variations while designed family digital logic some ttl chips were used analog circuits like schmitt triggers like series newer cmos versions series are also usable analog amplifiers using negative feedback similar operational amplifiers with only inverting input series derivative families part series cascadable 8-bit alu texas instruments sn74as888 die 74hc595 8-bit shift register die 74ahc00d quad 2-input nand gate manufactured by nxp semiconductors series parts were constructed using bipolar transistors forming what referred transistor–transistor logic ttl newer series more less compatible function logic level with original parts use cmos technology combination two bicmos originally bipolar circuits provided higher speed but consumed more power than competing series cmos devices bipolar devices are also limited fixed power supply voltage typically v while cmos parts often support range supply voltages milspec-rated devices for use extended temperature conditions are available series texas instruments also manufactured radiation-hardened devices with prefix rsn company offered beam-lead bare dies for integration into hybrid circuits with bl prefix designation regular-speed ttl parts were also available for time series – these had extended industrial temperature range −40 °c °c while companies such mullard listed 6400-series compatible parts data sheets by there was no mention family texas instruments ttl data book some companies have also offered industrial extended temperature range variants using regular series part numbers with prefix suffix indicate temperature grade integrated circuits series were made different technologies usually compatibility was retained with original ttl logic levels power supply voltages integrated circuit made cmos not ttl chip since uses field-effect transistors fets not bipolar junction transistors but similar part numbers are retained identify similar logic functions electrical power i/o voltage compatibility different subfamilies over different logic subfamilies use this standardized part number scheme bipolar o – standard ttl original logic family had no letters between part number ns gate delay mw dissipation 475–525 v released o 74l – low-power larger resistors allowed mw dissipation at cost very slow ns gate delay obsolete replaced by 74ls cmos technology introduced o 74h – high-speed ns gate delay but mw power dissipation used 1970s era supercomputers still produced but generally superseded by 74s series introduced o 74s – high-speed schottky implemented with schottky diode clamps at inputs prevent charge storage this provides faster operation than 74h series at cost increased power consumption cost ns gate delay mw dissipation released o 74ls – low-power schottky implemented using same technology 74s but with reduced power consumption switching speed typical ns gate delay remarkable for time mw dissipation 475–525 v o 74as – advanced schottky next iteration 74s series with greater speed fan-out despite lower power consumption implemented using 74s's technology with miller killer circuitry speed up low-to-high transition ns gate delay mw 45–55 v o 74als – advanced low-power schottky same technology 74as but with
