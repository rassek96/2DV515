geophysical year 1957–58 effort for this was american project vanguard after soviet launch world's first artificial satellite sputnik on october attention united states turned toward its own fledgling space efforts us congress alarmed by perceived threat national security technological leadership known sputnik crisis urged immediate swift action president dwight d eisenhower his advisers counseled more deliberate measures this led agreement that new federal agency mainly based on naca was needed conduct all non-military activity space advanced research projects agency arpa was created february

reacting loss national prestige security fears caused by early leads space exploration by soviet union president john f kennedy proposed ambitious goal landing man on moon by end returning him safely earth this goal was met by apollo program nasa planned even more ambitious activities leading manned mission mars however reduction perceived threat changing political priorities almost immediately

was one most expensive american scientific programs ever cost more than $20 billion 1960s dollars estimated $206 billion present-day us dollars comparison manhattan project cost roughly $263 billion accounting for inflation used saturn rockets launch vehicles which were far bigger than rockets built for previous projects spacecraft was also bigger had two main parts combined command service module csm lunar landing module lm lm was be left on moon only command module cm containing three astronauts would eventually return earth second manned mission apollo brought astronauts for first time flight around moon december shortly before soviets had sent unmanned spacecraft around moon on next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for moon landing were practiced then finally moon landing was made on apollo mission july apollo lunar vehicle first person stand on moon was neil armstrong who was followed by buzz aldrin while michael collins orbited above five subsequent

maximum payload low orbit kg lb missions could last from days crews could be from astronauts on missions 1983–98 space shuttle carried spacelab designed cooperation with european space agency esa spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight but remained shuttle's cargo bay astronauts entered left through airlock another famous series missions were launch later successful repair

nasa mission since 1960s main article budget nasa nasa's budget has generally been approximately 1% federal budget from early 1970s on after briefly peaking at approximately 441% during apollo program public perception nasa's budget has differed significantly from reality poll indicated that most americans responded that 20% federal budget went nasa percentage federal budget that nasa has been allocated has been steadily dropping since apollo program was estimated at 048% federal budget march meeting united states senate science committee neil degrasse tyson testified that right now nasa’s annual budget half penny on your tax dollar for twice that—a penny on dollar—we can transform country from sullen dispirited nation weary economic struggle one where has reclaimed its 20th century

environmental impact exhaust gases produced by rocket propulsion systems both earth's atmosphere space can adversely effect earth's environment some hypergolic rocket propellants such hydrazine are highly toxic prior combustion but decompose into less toxic compounds after burning rockets using hydrocarbon fuels such kerosene release carbon dioxide soot their exhaust however carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant compared those from other sources on average united states consumed us gallons 30382×109 l gallons liquid fuels per day while single falcon rocket first stage burns around us gallons l kerosene fuel per launch even if falcon were launched every single day would only represent 0006% liquid fuel consumption carbon dioxide emissions for that day additionally exhaust from
