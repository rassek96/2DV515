internal cleaning modern mice use optical technology directly trace movement surface under mouse are much more accurate durable almost maintenance free they work on wider variety surfaces can even operate on walls ceilings other non-horizontal surfaces other components proper ergonomic design personal computer workplace necessary prevent repetitive strain injuries which can develop over time can lead long-term disability all computers require either fixed removable storage for their operating system programs user-generated material early home computers used compact audio cassettes for file storage these were at time very low cost storage solution but were displaced by floppy disk drives when manufacturing costs dropped by mid-1980s initially 525-inch 35-inch floppy drives were principal forms removable storage for backup user files distribution software memory sizes increased capacity floppy did not keep pace zip drive other higher-capacity removable media were introduced but never became prevalent floppy drive by late 1990s optical drive cd later dvd blu-ray disc forms became main method for software distribution writeable media provided means for data backup file interchange result floppy drives became uncommon desktop personal computers since about were dropped from many laptop systems even earlier second generation tape recorders was provided when videocassette recorders were pressed into service backup media for larger disk drives all these systems were less reliable slower than purpose-built magnetic tape drives such tape drives were uncommon consumer-type personal computers but were necessity business industrial use interchange data such photographs from digital cameras greatly expedited by installation card reader which often compatible with several forms flash memory devices usually faster more convenient move large amounts data by removing card from mobile device instead communicating with mobile device through usb interface usb flash drive performs much data transfer backup functions formerly done with floppy drives zip disks other devices mainstream operating systems for personal computers provide built-in support for usb flash drives allowing interchange even between computers with different processors operating systems compact size lack moving parts dirt-sensitive media combined with low cost high capacity have made usb flash drives popular useful accessory for any personal computer user operating system can be located on any storage but typically installed on hard disk solid-state drive live cd represents
