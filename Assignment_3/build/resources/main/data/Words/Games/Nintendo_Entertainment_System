entertainment system following series arcade game successes early 1980s nintendo made plans create cartridge-based console called famicom which short for family computer masayuki uemura designed system original plans called for advanced 16-bit system which would function full-fledged computer with keyboard floppy disk drive but nintendo president hiroshi yamauchi rejected this instead decided go for cheaper more conventional cartridge-based game console he felt that features such keyboards disks were intimidating non-technophiles test model was constructed october verify functionality hardware after which work began on programming tools because 65xx cpus had not been manufactured sold japan up that time no cross-development software was available had be produced from scratch early famicom games were written on system that ran on nec pc-8001 computer leds on grid were used with digitizer design graphics no software design tools for this purpose existed at that time code name for project was gamecom but masayuki uemura's wife proposed name famicom arguing that japan 'pasokon' used mean personal computer but neither home personal computer perhaps we could say family computer meanwhile hiroshi yamauchi decided that console should use red white theme after seeing billboard for dx antenna which used those colors original plans called for famicom's cartridges be size cassette tape but ultimately they ended up being twice big careful design attention was paid cartridge connectors since loose faulty connections often plagued arcade machines necessitated taking connection lines for memory expansion nintendo decided produce their own connectors in-house rather than use ones from outside supplier game pad controllers were more-or-less copied directly from game & watch machines although famicom design team originally wanted use arcade-style joysticks even taking apart ones from american game consoles see how they worked was eventually decided that children might step on joysticks left on floor their durability was also questioned katsuyah nakawaka attached game & watch d-pad famicom prototype found that was easy use had no discomfort ultimately though they did install 15-pin expansion port on front console so that arcade-style joystick could be used optionally controllers were hard-wired console with no connectors for cost reasons uemura added eject lever cartridge slot which was not really necessary but he felt that children could be entertained by pressing he also added microphone second controller with idea that could be used make players' voices sound through tv speaker release console was released on july family computer famicom for short for ¥14800 alongside three ports nintendo's successful arcade games donkey kong donkey kong jr popeye famicom was slow gather momentum bad chip set caused initial release system crash following product recall reissue with new motherboard famicom’s popularity soared becoming best-selling game console japan by end encouraged by these successes nintendo soon turned its attention north american market nintendo entered into negotiations with atari release famicom under atari’s name name nintendo advanced video gaming system deal was set be finalized signed at summer consumer electronics show june however atari discovered at that show that its competitor coleco was illegally demonstrating its coleco adam computer with nintendo's donkey kong game this violation atari's exclusive license with nintendo publish game for its own computer systems delayed implementation nintendo's game console marketing contract with atari atari's ceo ray kassar was fired next month so deal went nowhere nintendo decided market its system on its owng proposed advanced video system bundle including cassette drive wireless accessories subsequent plans market famicom console north america featuring keyboard cassette data recorder wireless joystick controller special basic cartridge under name nintendo advanced video system likewise never materialized by beginning famicom had sold more than million units japan nintendo soon announced plans release north america advanced video entertainment system avs that same year american video game press was skeptical that console could have any success region with march issue electronic games magazine stating that videogame market america has virtually disappeared that this could be miscalculation on nintendo's part at june 1985's consumer electronics show ces nintendo unveiled american version its famicom with new case redesigned by lance barr featuring zero insertion force cartridge slot this system which would eventually be officially deployed nintendo entertainment system colloquial nes nintendo seeded these first systems limited american test markets starting new york city on october following up with full-fledged north american release console february following year nintendo released launch titles 10-yard fight baseball clu clu land duck hunt excitebike golf gyromite hogan’s alley ice climber kung fu pinball soccer stack-up tennis wild gunman wrecking crew super mario bros h some varieties these launch games contained famicom chips with adapter inside cartridge so they would play on north american consoles which why title screen gyromite has famicom title robot gyro title screen stack-up has famicom title robot block rob robotic operating buddy accessory for nes's launch although ended up having short product lifespan rob was initially used market nes novel sophisticated compared previous game consoles system was originally targeted for release spring but release date was pushed back after test-marketing new york city area late fall retailers had reportedly stated system failed miserably while others stated that nintendo had excellent nine-week market test new york last fall due moderate success launch new york city nintendo tried second time system was test-marketed further beginning february with nationwide release occurring september for more details on this topic see history nintendo entertainment system § north america system's launch represented not only new product but also reframing severely damaged home video game market segment whole video game market crash had occurred significant part due lack consumer retailer confidence video games which had turn been due partially confusion misrepresentation marketing video games prior nes packaging many video games presented bombastic artwork which exaggerated graphics actual game terms product identity single game such pac-man would appear many versions on many different game consoles computers with large variations graphics sound general quality between versions by stark contrast nintendo's marketing strategy aimed regain consumer retailer confidence by delivering singular platform whose technology was not need heavy exaggeration whose qualities were clearly defined differentiate nintendo's new home platform from early 1980s' common perception troubled shallow video game market company freshened its product nomenclature positioning established strict product approval licensing policy overall system was referred entertainment system instead video game system which was centered upon machine called control deck instead console which featured software cartridges called game paks instead video games 10nes lockout chip system acted lock-and-key coupling each game pak control deck deterring copying production nes games which had not first achieved nintendo's licensed approval packaging launch lineup nes games bore pictures very close representation actual onscreen graphics game which were sufficiently recognizable quality on their own symbols on launch games' packaging clearly indicated genre game order reduce consumer confusion 'seal quality' was printed on all appropriately licensed game accessory packaging initial seal stated this seal your assurance that nintendo has approved guaranteed quality this product this text was later changed official nintendo seal quality for more details on this topic see nintendo entertainment system § third-party licensing unlike with famicom nintendo america marketed console primarily children instituting rather strict policy censoring profanity sexual religious political content games most famous case this was lucasfilm's attempts port maniac mansion game with considerable amount material nintendo had issues with nes noa continued their censorship policy until with advent entertainment software rating board system optional robotic operating buddy rob was part marketing plan portray nes's technology being novel sophisticated when compared previous game consoles portray its position being within reach better established toy market while at first american public exhibited limited excitement for console itself peripherals such light gun rob also attracted extensive attention europe australia system was released two separate marketing regions one region consisted most mainland europe excluding italy distribution there was handled by number different companies with nintendo responsible for most cartridge releases most this region saw release mattel handled distribution for other region consisting united kingdom ireland canada italy australia new zealand starting following year not until 1990s did nintendo's newly created european branch direct distribution throughout europe nintendo entertainment system's control deck for its complete north american release

nintendo-released bundle package package included new style nes-101 console one redesigned dogbone game controller released october north america this final bundle retailed for us$4999 remained production until discontinuation nes reception by industry observers stated that nes's popularity had grown so quickly that market for nintendo cartridges was larger than that for all home computer software compute reported that nintendo had sold seven million nes systems almost many number commodore 64s sold its first five years computer game makers scared stiff magazine said stating that nintendo's popularity caused most competitors have poor sales during previous christmas resulted serious financial problems for some june nintendo america's vice president marketing peter main said that famicom was present 37% japan's households by 30% american households owned nes compared 23% for all personal computers by nes had outsold all previously released consoles worldwide slogan for this brand was can't be beaten europe south america nes was outsold by sega's master system while nintendo entertainment system was not available soviet union 1990s dawned gamers predicted that competition from technologically superior systems such 16-bit sega mega drive/genesis would mean immediate end nes’s dominance instead during first year nintendo's successor console super famicom named super nintendo entertainment system outside japan famicom remained second highest-selling video game console japan outselling newer more powerful nec pc engine sega mega drive by wide margin console remained popular japan north america until late when demand for new nes software abruptly plummeted final famicom game released japan takahashi meijin no bōken jima iv adventure island iv while north america wario's woods final licensed game last game be released europe was lion king wake ever decreasing sales lack new software titles nintendo america officially discontinued nes by nintendo kept producing new famicom units japan until september continued repair famicom consoles until october attributing discontinuation support insufficient supplies parts legacy nes was released after video game crash early 1980s whereupon many retailers adults had regarded electronic games being merely passing fad many believed at first that nes was another fad before nes/famicom nintendo was known moderately successful japanese toy playing card manufacturer popularity nes/famicom helped company grow into internationally recognized name almost synonymous with video games atari had been during era set stage for japanese dominance video game industry with nes nintendo also changed relationship console manufacturers third-party software developers by restricting developers from publishing distributing software without licensed approval this led higher quality software titles which helped change attitude public that had grown weary from poorly produced titles for other game systems day nes hardware was also very influential nintendo chose name nintendo entertainment system for us market redesigned system so would not give appearance child's toy front-loading cartridge input allowed be used more easily tv stand with other entertainment devices such videocassette recorder there were many prominent game franchises that originated on nes system's hardware limitations led game design similarities that still influence video game design culture some more important franchises that debuted on nes were nintendo's own super mario bros legend zelda metroid capcom's mega man franchise konami's castlevania franchise square's final fantasy enix's dragon quest franchises most these still exist today nes imagery especially its controller has become popular motif for variety products including nintendo's own game boy advance clothing accessories food items adorned with nes-themed imagery are still produced sold stores such items include hats shirts underwear

popularize battery-backed save functionality game pak main article nintendo entertainment system game pak north american pal nes cartridges game paks are significantly larger than japanese famicom cartridges nes uses 72-pin design compared with pins on famicom reduce costs inventory some early games released north america were simply famicom cartridges attached adapter fit inside nes hardware originally nes cartridges were held together with five small slotted screws games released after were redesigned slightly incorporate two plastic clips molded into plastic itself removing need for top two screws back cartridge bears label with instructions on handling production software revision codes were imprinted stamps on back label correspond with software version producer with exception legend zelda zelda ii adventure link manufactured gold-plastic carts all licensed ntsc pal cartridges are standard shade gray plastic unlicensed carts were produced black robin egg blue gold are all slightly different shapes than standard nes cartridges nintendo also produced yellow-plastic carts for internal use at nintendo service centers although these test carts were never made available for purchase all licensed us cartridges were made by nintendo konami acclaim for promotion ducktales remastered capcom sent limited-edition gold nes cartridges with original game featuring remastered art sticker different gaming news agencies instruction label on back included opening lyric from show's theme song life like hurricane japanese famicom cartridges are shaped slightly differently while nes used 72-pin interface famicom system used 60-pin design unlike nes games official famicom cartridges were produced many colors plastic adapters similar design popular accessory game genie are available that allow famicom games be played on nes japan several companies manufactured cartridges for famicom this allowed these companies develop their own customized chips designed for specific purposes such chips that increased quality sound their games third-party licensing famicom family mark started appearing games peripherals released from onward that were approved by nintendo for compatibility with official famicom consoles derivatives nintendo's near monopoly on home video game market left with degree influence over industry unlike atari which never actively courted third-party developers even went court attempt force activision cease production atari games nintendo had anticipated encouraged involvement third-party software developers strictly on nintendo's terms some nintendo platform-control measures were adopted by later console manufacturers such sega sony microsoft although not stringent this end 10nes authentication chip was placed every console another was placed every officially licensed cartridge if console's chip could not detect counterpart chip inside cartridge game would not load nintendo portrayed these measures intended protect public against poor-quality games placed golden seal approval on all licensed games released for system nintendo was not restrictive sega which did not permit third-party publishing until mediagenic late summer nintendo's intention was reserve large part nes game revenue for itself nintendo required that they be sole manufacturer all cartridges that publisher had pay full before cartridges for that game be produced cartridges could not be returned nintendo so publishers assumed all risk result some publishers lost more money due distress sales remaining inventory at end nes era than they ever earned profits from sales games because nintendo controlled production all cartridges was able enforce strict rules on its third-party developers which were required sign contract by nintendo that would obligate these parties develop exclusively for system order at least cartridges only make five games per year shortage dram rom chips also reportedly caused nintendo only permit 25% publishers' requests for cartridges this was average figure with some publishers receiving much higher amounts others almost none gamespy noted that nintendo's iron-clad terms made company many enemies during 1980s some developers tried circumvent five game limit by creating additional company brands like konami's ultra games label others tried circumventing 10nes chip further information § unlicensed games nintendo was accused antitrust behavior because strict licensing requirements united states department justice several states began probing nintendo's business practices leading involvement congress federal trade commission ftc ftc conducted extensive investigation which included interviewing hundreds retailers during ftc probe nintendo changed terms its publisher licensing agreements eliminate two-year rule other restrictive terms nintendo ftc settled case april with nintendo required send vouchers giving $5 discount off new game every person that had purchased nes title between june december gamespy remarked that nintendo's punishment was particularly weak giving case's findings although has been speculated that ftc did not want damage video game industry united states with nes near its end its life many third-party publishers such electronic arts supported upstart competing consoles with less strict licensing terms such sega genesis then playstation which eroded then took over nintendo's dominance home console market respectively consoles from nintendo's rivals post-snes era had always enjoyed much stronger third-party support than nintendo which relied more heavily on first-party games unlicensed games several companies refusing pay licensing fee having been rejected by nintendo found ways circumvent console's authentication system most these companies created circuits that used voltage spike temporarily disable 10nes chip nes few unlicensed games released europe australia came form dongle that would be connected licensed game order use licensed game's 10nes chip for authentication order combat unlicensed games nintendo america threatened retailers who sold them with losing their supply licensed titles addition multiple revisions were made nes pcbs prevent these games from working atari games created line nes products under name tengen took different approach company attempted reverse engineer lockout chip develop its own rabbit chip tengen also obtained description lockout chip from united states patent trademark office by falsely claiming that was required defend against present infringement claims legal case nintendo sued tengen for copyright infringement which tengen lost could not prove that legally obtained patent documents had not been used by reverse engineering team tengen's antitrust claims against nintendo were never finally decided color dreams produced christian video games under subsidiary name wisdom tree they were never sued by nintendo company probably feared public relations backlash emulation further information list video game emulators § nintendo entertainment system nes can be emulated on many other systems most notably pc first emulator was japanese-only pasofami was soon followed by ines which was available english was cross-platform was described being first nes emulation software that could be used by non-expert nesticle popular ms-dos emulator was released on april there have since been many other emulators virtual console for wii nintendo 3ds wii u also offers emulation many nes games game rentals nintendo entertainment system grew popularity entered millions american homes some small video rental shops began buying their own copies nes games renting them out customers for around same price video cassette rental for few days nintendo received no profit from practice beyond initial cost their game unlike movie rentals newly released game could hit store shelves be available for rent on same day nintendo took steps stop game rentals but didn't take any formal legal action until blockbuster video began make game rentals large-scale service nintendo claimed that allowing customers rent games would significantly hurt sales drive up cost games nintendo lost lawsuit but did win on claim copyright infringement blockbuster was banned from including original copyrighted instruction booklets with their rented games compliance with ruling blockbuster produced their own short instructions—usually form small booklet card label stuck on back rental box—that explained game's basic premise controls video rental shops continued practice renting video games still do today there were some risks with renting cartridge-based games most rental shops did not clean connectors they would become dirty over time renting using cartridge with dirty connectors posed problem for consoles especially nintendo entertainment system which was particularly susceptible operation problems failures when its internal connectors became dirty see design flaws section below hardware configurations although japanese famicom north american european nes versions included essentially same hardware there were certain key differences among systems original japanese famicom was predominantly white plastic with dark red trim featured top-loading cartridge slot grooves on both sides deck which hardwired game controllers could be placed when not use 15-pin expansion port located on unit's front panel for accessories original nes meanwhile featured front-loading cartridge covered by small hinged door that can be opened insert remove cartridge closed at other times features more subdued gray black red color scheme expansion port was found on bottom unit cartridge connector pinout was changed uk italy australia which share pal region two versions nes were released mattel version nes version when nes was first released those countries was distributed by mattel nintendo decided use lockout chip specific those countries different from chip used other european countries when nintendo took over european distribution they produced consoles that were then labelled nes version therefore only differences between two are text on front flap texture on top/bottom casing nes-101 control deck alongside its similarly redesigned nes-039 game controller october nintendo redesigned nes follow many same design cues newly introduced super nintendo entertainment system japanese super famicom like snes nes-101 model loaded cartridges through covered slot on top unit replacing complicated mechanism earlier design for this reason nes-101 known informally top-loader among nintendo fans hvc-101 control deck alongside its similarly redesigned hvc-102 game controller december famicom received similar redesign also loads cartridges through covered slot on top unit uses non-hardwired controllers because hvc-101 used composite video output instead being rf only like hvc-001 nintendo marketed newer model av famicom av仕様ファミコン eibui shiyō famikon since new controllers don't have microphones on them like second controller on original console certain games such disk system version legend zelda raid on bungeling bay will have certain tricks that cannot be replicated when played on hvc-101 famicom without modded controller hvc-101 famicom compatible with most nes controllers due having same controller port october nintendo had also released graphic capable headset called famicom system hvc-031 this peripheral accessory was never released outside japan design flaws vcr-like loading mechanism nes led problems over time design wore connector pins out quickly could easily become dirty resulting difficulties with nes reading game carts when nintendo released nes us design styling was deliberately different from that other game consoles nintendo wanted distinguish its product from those competitors avoid generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following video game crash one result this philosophy was disguise cartridge slot design front-loading zero insertion force zif cartridge socket designed resemble front-loading mechanism vcr newly designed connector worked quite well when both connector cartridges were clean pins on connector were new unfortunately zif connector was not truly zero insertion force when user inserted cartridge into nes force pressing cartridge down into place bent contact pins slightly well pressing cartridge’s rom board back into cartridge itself frequent insertion removal cartridges caused pins wear out from repeated usage over years zif design proved more prone interference by dirt dust than industry-standard card edge connector these design issues were not alleviated by nintendo’s choice materials console slot nickel connector springs would wear due design game cartridge copper connectors were also prone tarnishing many players would try alleviate issues game caused by this corrosion by blowing into cartridges then reinserting them which actually hurt copper connectors by speeding up tarnishing 10nes authentication chip contributed system's reliability problems circuit was ultimately removed from remodeled nes lockout famicom contained no lockout hardware result unlicensed cartridges both legitimate bootleg were extremely common throughout japan far east original nes but not top-loading nes-101 contained 10nes lockout chip which significantly increased challenges faced by unlicensed developers tinkerers at home later years discovered that disassembling nes cutting fourth pin lockout chip would change chip’s mode operation from lock key removing all effects greatly improving console’s ability play legal games well bootlegs converted imports nes consoles sold different regions had different lockout chips so games marketed one region would not work on consoles from another region known regions are usa/canada lockout chip most europe asia uk italy australia since two types lockout chip were used europe european nes game boxes often had b letter on front indicating whether game compatible with uk/italian/australian consoles rest europe b rest-of-europe games typically had text on box stating this game not compatible with mattel nes versions nintendo entertainment system similarly uk / italy / australia games stated this game only compatible with mattel nes versions nintendo entertainment system pirate cartridges for nes were rare but famicom ones were common widespread asia most were produced hong kong taiwan they usually featured variety small 32k less games which were selected from menu bank switched some were also hacks existing games especially super mario bros few were cartridge conversions famicom disk system titles such japanese smb2 problems with 10nes lockout chip frequently resulted console's most infamous problem blinking red power light which system appears turn itself on off repeatedly because 10nes would reset console once per second lockout chip required constant communication with chip game work dirty aging bent connectors would often disrupt communication resulting blink effect alternatively console would turn on but only show solid white gray green screen users attempted solve this problem by blowing air onto cartridge connectors inserting cartridge just far enough get zif lower licking edge connector slapping side system after inserting cartridge shifting cartridge from side side after insertion pushing zif up down repeatedly holding zif down lower than should have been cleaning connectors with alcohol these attempted solutions often became notable their own right are often remembered alongside nes many most frequent attempts fix this problem instead ran risk damaging cartridge and/or system nintendo released official nes cleaning kit help users clean malfunctioning cartridges consoles with release top-loading nes-101 nes toward end nes's lifespan nintendo resolved problems by switching standard card edge connector eliminating lockout chip all famicom systems used standard card edge connectors did nintendo’s subsequent game consoles super nintendo entertainment system nintendo response these hardware flaws nintendo authorized repair centers sprang up across us according nintendo authorization program was designed ensure that machines were properly repaired nintendo would ship necessary replacement parts only shops that had enrolled authorization program practice authorization process consisted nothing more than paying fee nintendo for privilege recent trend many sites have sprung up offer nintendo repair parts guides services that replace those formerly offered by authorized repair centers famicom system nintendo released headset peripheral called famicom system for stereoscopic entertainment this was

featured only radio frequency rf modulator output when console was released north america europe support for composite video through rca connectors was added addition rf modulator hvc-101 model famicom dropped rf modulator entirely adopted composite video output via proprietary 12-pin multi-out connector first introduced for super famicom/super nintendo entertainment system conversely north american re-released nes-101 model most closely resembled original hvc-001 model famicom that featured rf modulator output only finally playchoice-10 utilized inverted rgb video output stock nes

controllers could be unplugged they nevertheless lacked microphone featured famicom controllers controllers game controller used for both nes famicom featured oblong brick-like design with simple four button layout two round buttons labeled b start button select button additionally controllers utilized cross-shaped joypad designed by nintendo employee gunpei yokoi for nintendo game & watch systems replace bulkier joysticks on earlier gaming consoles’ controllers original model famicom featured two game controllers both which were hardwired back console second controller lacked start select buttons but featured small microphone relatively few games made use this feature earliest produced famicom units initially had square b buttons this was changed circular designs because square buttons being caught controller casing when pressed down glitches within hardware causing system freeze occasionally while playing game nes dropped hardwired controllers instead featuring two custom 7-pin ports on front console also contrast famicom controllers included with nes were identical swappable neither controller possessed microphone that was present on famicom model both controllers included start select buttons allowing some nes localizations games such legend zelda use start button on second controller save game without dying first however nes controllers lacked microphone which was used on famicom version zelda kill certain enemies nes zapper light gun accessory number special controllers designed for use with specific games were released for system though very few such devices proved particularly popular such devices included but were not limited zapper light gun rob power pad original famicom featured deepened da-15 expansion port on front unit which was used connect most auxiliary devices on nes these special controllers were generally connected one two control ports on front console nintendo also made two turbo controllers for nes called nes advantage nes max both controllers had turbo feature feature where one tap button represented multiple taps this feature allowed players shoot much faster during shooter games nes advantage had two knobs that adjusted firing rate turbo button from quick turbo well slow button that slowed down game by rapidly pausing game slow button did not work with games that had pause menu pause screen can interfere with jumping shooting nes max also had turbo feature but was not adjustable contrast with advantage also did not have slow button its wing-like shape made easier hold than advantage also improved on joystick turbo features were also featured on nes satellite nes four score u-force other accessories include power pad power glove which was featured movie wizard near end nes's lifespan upon release av famicom
