was not long before technology began appearing arcade shooting games beginning with seeburg ray-o-lite these early light gun games like modern laser tag used small targets usually moving onto which light-sensing tube was mounted player used gun usually rifle that emitted beam light when trigger was pulled if beam struck target hit was scored these games evolved throughout subsequent decades culminating sega's periscope company's first successful game released which required player target cardboard ships periscope was early electro-mechanical game first arcade game cost quarter per play sega's game missile featured electronic sound moving film strip represent targets on projection screen their game killer shark featured mounted light gun that shot at targets whose movement reactions were displayed using back image projection onto screen nintendo released beam gun laser clay shooting system followed by arcade game wild gunman which used video projection display target on screen sega released early co-operative light gun shooters balloon gun bullet mark use video games video game light gun typically modeled on ballistic weapon usually pistol used for targeting objects on video screen with force feedback light gun can also simulate recoil weapon first gun for home console was fact big rifle magnavox odyssey's shooting gallery which looked very lifelike even needed be cocked after each shot light guns are very popular arcade games but had not caught on well home video game console market until after nintendo entertainment system nes sega master system sms mega drive/genesis super nintendo entertainment system snes systems atari xegs many home 'pong' systems 1970s included pistol gun for shooting simple targets on screen nintendo's nes zapper for nes most popular example light gun duck hunt its most popular game traditional light guns cannot be used on newer lcd plasma screens have problems with projection screens there are also light guns for sega saturn xbox several other console arcade systems recent light gun video games include resident evil umbrella chronicles time crisis virtua cop house dead overkill nintendo released wii zapper for wii peripheral which actually plastic shell that houses both wii remote nunchuk for gun-style video games while does not contain any traditional light gun technology peripheral makes use wii remote's built-in infrared tracking system shoot targets that correspond on-screen its name reference classic nes zapper for nintendo entertainment system sony have also released attachments that house playstation move motion controller form pistol rifle latter named sharp shooter namco's guncon also uses infrared optical sensor system similar wii remote design light gun named because uses light its method detecting where on screen user targeting name leads one believe that gun itself emits beam light but fact most light guns actually receive light through photodiode gun barrel there are two versions this technique that are commonly used but concept same when trigger gun pulled screen blanked out black diode begins reception all part screen painted white way that allows computer judge where gun pointing based on when diode detects light user light gun notices little nothing because period which screen blank usually only fraction second see persistence vision sequential targets first detection method used by zapper involves drawing each target sequentially white light after screen blacks out computer knows that if diode detects light drawing square after screen refreshes then that target at which gun pointed essentially diode tells computer whether not player hit something for n objects sequence drawing targets tell computer which target player hit after + ceillog2 n refreshes one refresh determine if any target at all was hit ceillog2n do binary search for object that was hit interesting side effect this that on poorly designed games often player can point gun at light bulb pull trigger hit first target every time better games account for this either by detecting if all targets appear match by displaying black screen verifying that no targets match cathode ray timing black guncon made by namco for playstation blue top pink middle konami justifiers made for super nintendo entertainment system green bottom one made for playstation second method used by super nintendo entertainment system's super scope computer light pens more elaborate more accurate trick this method lies nature cathode ray tube inside video monitor crts were only affordable tv monitors late 1980s early 1990s when this method was popularized screen drawn by scanning electron beam that travels across screen starting at top until hits end then moves down update next line this done repeatedly until entire screen drawn appears instantaneous human eye done very quickly when player pulls trigger computer often assisted by display circuitry times how long takes electron beam excite phosphor at location at which gun pointed light gun sends signal after sensing sudden small change brightness point on screen when electron gun refreshes that spot computer then calculates targeted position based on monitor's horizontal refresh rate fixed amount time takes beam get from left right side screen either computer provides time base for horizontal refresh rate through controller's connector super scope gun reads composite video signal through t-connector on a/v cable guncon once computer knows where gun pointed can tell through collision detection if coincides with target not many guns this type including super scope ignore red light red phosphors have much slower rate decay than green blue phosphors result some but not all games brighten entire screen's green/blue pixels somewhat when trigger pulled order get more reliable fix on position display timing not possible with plasma lcd dlp monitors since they do not have off state between refreshes combined method some light guns designed for sequential targeting are not timed precisely enough get x y reading against video signal but they can use combination two methods first screen brightened response time measured cathode ray timing but computer measures only which scanline was hit not which horizontal pixel was hit this does not need nearly fast timer that pure cathode ray timing uses on order khz for y vs mhz for x y on standard resolution display then using sequential targets game cycles among those targets on line infrared emitters new method was developed compensate for display technologies other than crt relies on one several infrared light emitters placed near screen one ir sensor on muzzle gun when trigger pressed gun sends intensity ir beam detects since this intensity depends upon both distance relative angle screen angle sensors are located gun this way trigonometric equation system solved muzzle's position relative screen calculated then by projecting muzzle on screen with measured angles impact point determined early example this technology though not using ir can be seen nes power glove accessory which used three ultrasonic sensors serving same function ir emitters used some lightguns simpler variant commonly used arcades where there are no angle detectors but ir sensors however this can prove inaccurate when shooting from certain distances angles since calculation angles position has larger margin error other variants include more emitters with different infrared wavelengths same number sensors with this method proper calibration three more relative angles are obtained thus not needing angle detectors position gun sometimes sensors are placed around screen emitter on gun but calculations are similar wii remote uses infrared video camera handheld controller rather than simple sensor this family methods are used for wii remote guncon modern arcade light gun games image capture when user pulls trigger screen replaced for split-second with seemingly random display black white pixels groups pixels blocks light gun contains fine-resolution but low pixel count digital camera with very narrow field view with just handful encrypted random dot image pixels captured gun converts small image into binary array which allows computer locate exact position gun was pointed at this method compatible with any screen any size size screen distance shooter entered into gun driver software determine dimensions random blocks/pixels best allow rendering on light gun ccd multiplayer game that uses more than one gun reads both triggers continuously then when one player pulls gun's trigger game reads that gun until knows which object was hit positional guns positional guns are fairly common video arcades positional gun gun mounted cabinet on swivel that allows player aim gun these are often confused with light guns but work quite differently these guns may not be removed from cabinet like their optical counterparts which are tethered stored mounted holster they are typically more expensive initially but easier maintain repair games that use positional guns include silent scope arcade version resident evil survivor space gun revolution x terminator judgment day console ports sometimes use light guns positional gun essentially analog joystick that records position gun determine where player aiming on screen gun must be calibrated which usually happens after powering up early examples positional gun include sega's sea devil taito's attack cross fire nintendo's battle shark some games however have mounted optical guns
