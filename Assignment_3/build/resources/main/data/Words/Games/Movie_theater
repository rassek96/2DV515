lot cinema's best tricks – like good production values top tier actors – brought them into people's living rooms since 2010s one increasing sources competition for movie theaters increasing ownership by people home theater systems which can display high-resolution blu-ray disks movies on large widescreen flat-screen tvs with surround sound powerful subwoofer for low-pitched sounds ticket price uniformity relatively strong uniformity movie ticket prices particularly us common economics puzzle because conventional supply demand theory would suggest higher prices for more popular more expensive movies lower prices for unpopular bomb for documentary with less audience appeal unlike seemingly similar forms entertainment such rock concerts which popular performer's tickets cost much more than unpopular performer's tickets demand for movies very difficult predict ahead time indeed some films with major stars such gigli which starred then-supercouple ben affleck jennifer lopez have turned out be box-office bombs while low-budget films with unknown actors have become smash hits eg blair witch project demand for films usually determined from ticket sale statistics after movie already out uniform pricing therefore strategy cope with unpredictable demand historical cultural factors are sometimes also cited ticket check some movie theater complexes theaters are arranged such that tickets are checked at entrance into entire plaza rather than before each theater at theater with sold-out show there often additional ticket check make sure that everybody with ticket for that show can find seat lobby may be before after ticket check controversies advertising some moviegoers complain about commercial advertising shorts played before films arguing that their absence used be one main advantages going movie theater other critics such roger ebert have expressed concerns that these advertisements plus excessive number movie trailers could lead pressure restrict preferred length feature films themselves facilitate playing schedules so far theater companies have typically been highly resistant these complaints citing need for supplementary income some chains like famous players amc theatres have compromised with commercials restricted being shown before scheduled start time for trailers feature film individual theaters within chain also sometimes adopt this policy loudness another major recent concern that dramatic improvements stereo sound systems subwoofer systems have led cinemas playing soundtracks films at unacceptably high volume levels usually trailers are presented at very high sound level presumably overcome sounds busy crowd sound not adjusted downward for sparsely occupied theater some patrons employ earplugs for trailer period volume normally adjusted based on projectionist's judgment high low attendance film usually shown at lower volume level than trailers response audience complaints manager at cinemark theater california explained that studios set trailer sound levels not theater copyright piracy recent years cinemas have started show warnings before movie starts against using cameras camcorders during movie camming some patrons record movie order sell bootleg copies on black market these warnings threaten customers with being removed from cinema arrested by police this example was shown at cinemas united kingdom you are not permitted use any camera recording equipment this cinema this will be treated attempt breach copyright any person doing so can be ejected such articles may be confiscated by police we ask audience be vigilant against any such activity report any matters arousing suspicion cinema staff thank you some theaters including those with imax stadiums have detectors at doors pick up recording smugglers at particularly anticipated showings theaters may employ night vision equipment detect working camera during screening some jurisdictions this illegal unless practice has been announced public advance crowd control movie theaters have grown into multiplexes megaplexes crowd control has become major concern overcrowded megaplex can be rather unpleasant emergency can be extremely dangerous indeed shouting fire crowded theater standard example american english limits free speech because could cause deadly panic therefore all major theater chains have implemented crowd control measures most well-known measure ubiquitous holdout line which prevents ticket holders for next showing that weekend's most popular movie from entering building until their particular auditorium has been cleared out cleaned since 1980s some theater chains especially amc theatres have developed policy co-locating their theaters shopping centers opposed old practice building stand-alone theaters some cases lobbies corridors cannot hold many people auditoriums thus making holdout lines necessary turn ticket holders may be enticed shop eat while stuck outside holdout line however given fact that rent based on floor area practice having smaller lobby somewhat understandable bag popcorn from plaza theater atlanta refunds most cinema companies issue refunds if there technical fault such power outage that stops people from seeing movie refunds may be offered during initial minutes screening new york times reported that some audience members walked out terrence malick's film tree life asked for refunds at amc theaters patrons who sat through entire film then decided they wanted their money back were out luck amc's policy only offer refunds minutes into screening same goes for landmark independent movie chain whose policy states if film not what expected… feature viewed less than minutes refund can be processed for you at box office snack prices price soft drinks candy at theaters typically significantly higher than cost those items at fast food chain food store respectively popcorn prices can also be exorbitant has been estimated that movie theaters make 85% profit at concessions stand on overpriced soda candy nachos hot dogs course popcorn movie-theater popcorn has been called one america's biggest rip-offs with retail price nine times what costs make intimacy even prior invention motion pictures darkened auditoriums opera houses were associated with physical intimacy between couples particularly expensive private boxes loges balcony which had curtains that could be drawn since introduction movie theater this tradition continued some couples attend movies for additional reason that darkened auditorium provides possibility some kissing physical intimacy with additional privacy back row ie same amount intimacy lesser form public display affection this applies particular for young people who still live with their parents whose parents tend monitor
