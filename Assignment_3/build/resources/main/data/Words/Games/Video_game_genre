classified independent their setting game-world content unlike other works fiction such films books for example shooter game still shooter game regardless whether takes place fantasy world outer space with nearly all varieties genre classification matter any individual video game's specific genre open personal interpretation moreover each individual game may belong several genres at once contents history definition practice studies see also references history first attempt classify different genres video games was made by chris crawford his book art computer game design this book crawford primarily focused on player's experience activities required for gameplay here he also stated that state computer game design changing quickly we would therefore expect taxonomy presented become obsolete inadequate short time since then among other genres platformer shooter genres which hardly existed at time have gained lot popularity though genres were mostly just interesting for game studies 1980s more money was made video game industry 1990s both smaller independent publishers had little chance surviving because this games settled more into set genres that larger publishers retailers could use for marketing definition this space-themed video game shoot 'em up side-scrolling shooter due direct active participation player video game genres differ from literary film genres though one could state that space invaders science-fiction video game such classification ignores differences similarities which are be found player's experience game contrast visual aesthetics games which can vary greatly argued that interactivity characteristics that are common all games focusing on these characteristics would allow more nuanced meaningful critical vocabulary for discussing video games regardless there little agreement on how game genres are created classified resulting multiple classification schemes descriptive names genres take into account goals game protagonist even perspective offered player for example first-person shooter game that played from first-person perspective involves practice shooting term subgenre may be used refer category within genre further specify genre game under discussion whereas shooter game genre name first-person shooter third-person shooter are common subgenres shooter genre other examples such prefixes are real-time turn based top-down side-scrolling video games may have aspects that don't fall within genre game classified however aberrations are tolerated some degree for example one weapons shooter game might be something other than gun which may be seen breach game's rules if shooter game only featured weapons that aren't guns would no longer be accepted representative its genre game might fail commercially because its misleading label target audience underlying theme purpose game are sometimes used genre identifier such with games for girls christian game serious game respectively however because these terms do not indicate anything about gameplay video game these are not considered genres practice video game genres vary specificity with popular video game reviews using genre names varying from action baseball this practice basic themes more fundamental characteristics are used alongside each other game may combine aspects multiple genres such way that becomes hard classify under existing genres for example because grand theft auto iii combined shooting driving roleplaying unusual way was hard classify using existing terms since then term grand theft auto clone has been used describe games mechanically similar grand theft auto iii similarly term roguelike has been developed for games that share similarities with rogue elements role-playing genre which focuses on storytelling character improvements have been implemented many different genres video games this because addition story action strategy puzzle video games does not take away from core gameplay but adds incentive other than survival experience studies studying video game genres discipline has only been done some extent historical genre video game genres developed naturally are therefore uncategorized according lars konzack university copenhagen one should not expect that may fully describe field video game genres though hat not say that no formal approach unwelcome discouraged furthermore konzack states that with every new video game video game genres slowly radically transform with most games having small changes but once while new game comes along radically change how specific genre perceived richard van eck argues that there are multiple ways for categorizing video game genres use one them being popular genre system used by game publishers mainstream gaming press these are used by players well interpret characteristics individual games another way defining genres are proposed by designers who have extended revised popular genre system lastly van eck claims that academics various disciplines have approached topic their own way attempted create categorization video games though all these approaches share objective making meaningful distinctions they differ somewhat purpose where publishers marketers use genres buzzword attract sales academics might attempt understand how issue genre fits into digital games extended from tradition print-based writing film other forms cultural production
