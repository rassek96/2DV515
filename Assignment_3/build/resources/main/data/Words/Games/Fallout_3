this over-the-shoulder third-person perspective at any time after initial stages game while many elements from previous titles are used such special system enemies encountered combat played out differently while new features are included into series character creation attributes pip-boy wrist computer remains key feature series for character menus fallout players get use pip-boy shown here character creation done through tutorial prologue that encompasses different ages player's characters which also covers tutorials on movement hud combat interactions with game world use pip-boy character's creation done steps with player first setting up their appearance along with what race gender their character name they have next they customize their character's primary attributes via special system - strength perception endurance charisma intelligence agility luck - which retained fallout determines base level skills game uses what three skills their character focuses on can either be left choices they make with series question by choosing manually what they desire character creation not finalized until player finally leaves vault enters capital wastelands allowing players option modify their character's appearance primary attributes skill choices if they are not satisfied with their choices character progresses through game experience points xp are earned from accomplishing various actions such completing quest killing enemy so forth with new level granted upon reaching necessary amount xp new level grants player ability allocate points various skills available thus improve upon them making them more effective for instance higher lock-picking skill allows player be able tackle more difficult locks on doors containers while higher medicine skill increases amount health recovered with stimpaks once character achieves their second level they can be granted perk which offers advantages varying quality form such being able carry more items finding more ammo containers having higher chance perform critical hit many perks have set prerequisites that need be satisfied often requiring certain skill level acquire them while new perk can be granted for every two levels earned by character additional improvements skill levels can be made by finding skill books which confer permanent boost levels while players can also search for find series around bobbleheads that also confer bonus these also primary attributes important statistic tracked by game karma which affected by decisions actions character performs during game positive actions karma include freeing captives helping others while negative actions towards this include killing good characters stealing actions vary level karma change they cause thus pickpocketing produces less negative karma than killing good character karma can have tangible effects player beyond acting flavor for game's events that can affect ending player gets alter dialogue with non-player characters npcs give off unique reactions from other characters while also granting access certain perks that require specific karma level however player's relationships with game's factions are distinct so any two groups settlements may view player contrasting ways depending on player's conduct health weapons apparel character's health divided between two types hp limbs while hp general amount health that character other npcs have friendly neutral hostile which depletes when damage taken either from combat setting off traps falling from height self injury limb health specific each portion body - namely arms legs head torso although non-human enemies feature additional appendages robotic enemies feature different types appendages limbs can be damaged same way hp though once depleted they become crippled induce negative status effect such blurred vision if head crippled reduced movement speed if one both legs are crippled both hp limbs can be recovered through use medical medicine form stimpaks well sleeping visiting doctor while hp can be slowly recovered by consuming food drinking water and/of soft drinks players can also be effected by other negative health effects including radiation poisoning withdrawal symptoms while latter occurs when player's character becomes addicted drugs alcohol confers negative effects if player does not continue using them radiation poisoning occurs when character absorbs radiation either by walking through areas with background radiation consuming food drink that irradiated with small amount radiation negative impacts both can affect special attributes can be treated by doctor though radiation can be dealt with by using rad away furthermore amount background radiation absorbed can be reduced through use rad-x drugs special apparel both which improve resistance radiation all weapons apparel found within wastelands regardless whether they are makeshift-weapon such lead pipe gun degrade over time more they are used thus become less effective for firearms degrading into poor condition causes them do less damage possibly jam when reloading while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective gradually absorbs damage from attacks when too much damage taken items breaks cannot be used ensure weapons apparel are working effectively such items require constant maintenance repairs which can be done one two ways first method find certain vendors that repair items though how much they can repair item depends on their skill level while cost repairs depends upon item itself second method for players find second same item that needs repairs comparable item salvaging parts from for repair though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level repairs addition finding weaponry out wastelands player can also create their own craft such weapons player must use workbench possess either necessary schematics right perk scavenge for items needed make them these weapons usually possess significant advantages over other weapons their type each weapon's schematic has three copies that can be found possessing additional copies improves condition number items produced at workbench while higher repair skill will result better starting condition for related weapon weapon schematics can be found lying certain locations bought from vendors received quest rewards vats vats system new gameplay element for fallout series seen here real-time action stopped player can see both damage that has been done target's limbs percentage ratio for attempting attack that limb vault-tec assisted targeting system referred vats new element for fallout series plays important part combat within fallout system was introduced by bethesda's developers who described hybrid between timeturn-based real-time combat so much that while using vats real-time combat paused action played out from varying camera angles computer graphics version bullet time using system costs action points ap amount which depends on weapon being used thus limiting actions player's combat during turn through system player can not only switch between multiple targets if there more than one around at any time but also target specific areas them inflict damage - player could either target head for quick kill go for legs slow enemy's movements shoot at their weapons disarm them for some enemies they can put them into berserker rage by hitting specific parts chance striking different area displayed percentage ratio dependent on weapon being used distance between character target character who higher level when using vats also more likely hit enemy with system than lower level character use vats does confer negative effect that eliminates most first-person shooter elements game aiming taken over by computer player unable move means avoiding attacks furthermore ranged weapons are capable hitting limbs while melee weapons focus on target whole when using vats companions during their travels across wastelands player can be accompanied by single non-player character npc companion who can assist combat which companion can accompany player depends on who they have encountered that can join them possible not encounter all depending on how game played only one companion may travel with player should they wish take another with them first must be dismissed either voluntarily by player consequence other events die combat one unique companion player can have that can allow third join without issue dog named dogmeat who can be killed during game if player misuses him places him
