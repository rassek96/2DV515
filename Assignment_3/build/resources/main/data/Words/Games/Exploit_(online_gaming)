hit boxes speed etc by player their advantage manner not intended by game's designers exploits have been classified form cheating however precise determination what not considered exploit can be controversial this debate stems from number factors but typically involves argument that issues are part game require no changes external programs take advantage them contents controversy griefing common types response see also references external links controversy whether exploit considered cheat all exploits are cheats matter widespread debate that varies between genres games other factors distinction important decides how developers community responds issue players who exploit issue on one hand exploits can be considered illegitimate cheats that developers should address exploiters should be banned while on other hand exploits can be considered simply part game arguments favor cheating view involve spirit game potentially damaging effects exploit on game's community while rules game code may not explicitly disallow specific exploit may be seen that using that exploit goes against spirit game potential damage exploit on game has been described by world warcraft community manager devastating defense these behaviors are arguments that rules game allow that players might not know they are behaving against designer's intention so-called exploits this view are not cheats because they do not change game any way therefore could be accessible all players if they know how do players who use such techniques may consider them fair for use game cases when they are not explicitly disallowed terms service other such rules governing participation griefing see also griefing while players more frequently exploit issues gain advantage for themselves sometimes they may use them instead irritate other players known griefing one team gamers team fortress produced popular online videos demonstrating their griefing also several exploits present game most them being little use for personal gain another famous incident during ultima online beta test saw player kill lord british when that character was supposed be invincible tester was later banned for exploiting rather than reporting bugs he found common types common types exploits include duping duplicating items money lag disconnection exploits game with inadequate lag handling may let players intentionally cause lag for themselves cause advantage similarly game that lets player disconnect immediately with no consequences may let players exit game without suffering loss shogun total war geometry taking advantage how game world built typically goal these exploits reach normally inaccessible areas take unintended shortcuts game world these are commonly achieved by going through walls crossing invisible barriers made by programmers scaling ledges not intended be climbable twinking twinking usually refers taking advantage design flaws game's gearing system order equip new low level character with much higher level gear other actions commonly referred twinking include giving new character large amount gold intentionally keeping character at low level while gaining much better equipment movement speed bugs these usually allow player move faster than intended such bunny hopping many these have been embraced by certain games such skiing tribes series safe zones places where player can attack with no risk being attacked back this often form exploit geometry terrain game—however game may have areas that make players within them safe especially pvp games/zones where opposing factions may not enter from attack while not disallowing safe players attack game mechanics taking advantage systems that make up gameplay game mechanics exploit not bug—it working designed but at same time not working intended example wavedash super smash bros melee where momentum gained from using directional aerial dodge could be retained on landing with proper timing this allows characters use stationary attack while sliding across ground cheesing performing repeated usually considered cheap attack moves such way that doesn't allow enemy respond fight back example would be street fighter ii which you can perform repeated moves that keep enemy being attacked against side screen with no way for them perform counterattack each game has potential for exploits unique that game's rules for example world warcraft wall-walking allowed player climb steep mountains that are supposed be impassable get into unfinished areas make one's character not attackable by mobs other players everquest had exploit player versus player analogous weight cutting sports whereby player would intentionally lose levels by dying order compete against lower-level players while wielding higher-level items skills game mechanics exploit game city heroes people were using teleport powers place others inside pvp zones' watchtowers which originally designed props for atmosphere had no way out if you could not teleport towers have since gained doorway response developers may find difficult identify respond exploit because player who discovers vulnerability game may be reluctant inform game's developers order continue exploiting however once developers do find exploits response may include banning players who took advantage exploit changing game's rules combat even embracing exploit positive opinion exploit can lead designers embracing emergent gameplay such when skiing tribes series games gained developer support now-standard practice rocket jumping originated similar way by exploiting game mechanics not foreseen by developers otherwise developers may try fix underlying problem discourage use exploit if issue cannot be clearly addressed by technical means severe cases players may be banned further game state world may need be reset restore game balance for example following serious currency dupe exploit everquest ii developers removed large amounts duped money from game address
