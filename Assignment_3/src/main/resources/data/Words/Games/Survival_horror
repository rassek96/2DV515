action-adventure elements from metal gear while retaining horror atmosphere its predecessor sweet home pictured above was role-playing video game often called first survival horror cited main inspiration for resident evil however game often considered first true survival horror due having most influence on resident evil was release sweet home for nintendo entertainment system was created by tokuro fujiwara who would later go on create resident evil sweet home's gameplay focused on solving variety puzzles using items stored limited inventory while battling escaping from horrifying creatures which could lead permanent death for any characters thus creating tension emphasis on survival was also first attempt at creating scary frightening storyline within game mainly told through scattered diary entries left behind fifty years before events game developed by capcom game would become main inspiration behind their later release resident evil which also borrowed various other elements from game such its mansion setting opening door load screen death animations multiple endings depending on which characters survive dual character paths individual character skills limited item management story told through diary entries frescos emphasis on atmosphere horrific imagery latter prevented its release western world though its influence was felt through resident evil which was originally intended be remake game some consider sweet home be first true survival horror game electronic arts published project firestart developed by dynamix unlike most other early games genre featured science fiction setting inspired by film alien but had gameplay that closely resembled later survival horror games many ways fahs considers first achieve kind fully formed vision survival horror we know today citing its balance action adventure limited ammunition weak weaponry vulnerable main character feeling isolation storytelling through journals graphic violence use dynamically triggered music - all which are characteristic elements later games survival horror genre despite this not likely direct influence on later games genre similarities are largely example parallel

replicate successful formula seen resident evil every subsequent survival horror game has arguably taken stance relation golden age 1996–2004 success resident evil was responsible for its template being used basis for wave successful survival horror games many which were referred resident evil clones golden age survival horror started by resident evil reached its peak around turn millennium with silent hill followed by general decline few years later among resident evil clones at time there were several survival horror titles that stood out such clock tower clock tower ghost head for playstation these clock tower games proved be hits capitalizing on success resident evil while staying true graphic-adventure gameplay original clock tower rather than following resident evil formula another survival horror title that differentiated itself was corpse party indie psychological horror adventure game created using rpg maker engine much like clock tower later haunting ground player
