discovered by johann hittorf primitive crookes tubes he observed that some unknown rays were emitted from cathode negative electrode which could cast shadows on glowing wall tube indicating rays were traveling straight lines arthur schuster demonstrated cathode rays could be deflected by electric fields william crookes showed they could be deflected by magnetic fields j j thomson succeeded measuring mass cathode rays showing that they consisted negatively charged particles smaller than atoms first subatomic particles which were later named electrons earliest version crt was known braun tube invented by german physicist ferdinand braun was cold-cathode diode modification crookes tube with phosphor -coated screen russian scientist boris rosing used crt receiving end experimental video signal form picture he managed display simple geometric shapes onto screen which marked first time that crt technology was used for what now known television first cathode ray tube use hot cathode was developed by john b johnson who gave his name term johnson noise harry weiner weinhart western electric became commercial product was named by inventor vladimir k zworykin rca was granted trademark for term for its cathode ray tube voluntarily released term public domain first commercially made electronic television sets with cathode ray tubes were manufactured by telefunken germany oscilloscope crts oscilloscope showing lissajous curve oscilloscope crts electrostatic deflection used rather than magnetic deflection commonly used with television other large crts beam deflected horizontally by applying electric field between pair plates its left right vertically by applying electric field plates above below televisions use magnetic rather than electrostatic deflection because deflection plates obstruct beam when deflection angle large required for tubes that are relatively short for their size phosphor persistence various phosphors are available depending upon needs measurement display application brightness color persistence illumination depends upon type phosphor used on crt screen phosphors are available with persistences ranging from less than one microsecond several seconds for visual observation brief transient events long persistence phosphor may be desirable for events which are fast repetitive high frequency short-persistence phosphor generally preferable microchannel plate when displaying fast one-shot events electron beam must deflect very quickly with few electrons impinging on screen leading faint invisible image on display oscilloscope crts designed for very fast signals can give brighter display by passing electron beam through micro-channel plate just before reaches screen through phenomenon secondary emission this plate multiplies number electrons reaching phosphor screen giving significant improvement writing rate brightness improved sensitivity spot size well graticules most oscilloscopes have graticule part visual display facilitate measurements graticule may be permanently marked inside face crt may be transparent external plate made glass acrylic plastic internal graticule eliminates parallax error but cannot be changed accommodate different types measurements oscilloscopes commonly provide means for graticule be illuminated from side which improves its visibility image storage tubes tektronix type first mass produced analog phosphor storage oscilloscope these are found analog phosphor storage oscilloscopes these are distinct from digital storage oscilloscopes which rely on solid state digital memory store image where single brief event monitored by oscilloscope such event will be displayed by conventional tube only while actually occurs use long persistence phosphor may allow image be observed after event but only for few seconds at best this limitation can be overcome by use direct view storage cathode ray tube storage tube storage tube will continue display event after has occurred until such time erased storage tube similar conventional tube except that equipped with metal grid coated with dielectric layer located immediately behind phosphor screen externally applied voltage mesh initially ensures that whole mesh at constant potential this mesh constantly exposed low velocity electron beam from 'flood gun' which operates independently main gun this flood gun not deflected like main gun but constantly 'illuminates' whole storage mesh initial charge on storage mesh such repel electrons from flood gun which are prevented from striking phosphor screen when main electron gun writes image screen energy main beam sufficient create 'potential relief' on storage mesh areas where this relief created no longer repel electrons from flood gun which now pass through mesh illuminate phosphor screen consequently image that was briefly traced out by main gun continues be displayed after has occurred image can be 'erased' by resupplying external voltage mesh restoring its constant potential time for which image can be displayed was limited because practice flood gun slowly neutralises charge on storage mesh one way allowing image be retained for longer temporarily turn off flood gun then possible for image be retained for several days majority storage tubes allow for lower voltage be applied storage mesh which slowly restores initial charge state by varying this voltage variable persistence obtained turning off flood gun voltage supply storage mesh allows such tube operate conventional oscilloscope tube data storage tubes main article williams tube williams

not display device fact could not be viewed since metal plate covered its screen color crts magnified view delta-gun shadow mask color crt magnified view trinitron color crt spectra constituent blue green red phosphors common crt color tubes use three different phosphors which emit red green blue light respectively they are packed together stripes aperture grille designs clusters called triads shadow mask crts color crts have three electron guns one for each primary color arranged either straight line equilateral triangular configuration guns are usually constructed single unit triangular configuration often called delta-gun based on its relation shape greek letter delta δ grille mask absorbs electrons that would otherwise hit wrong phosphor shadow mask tube uses metal plate with tiny holes placed so that electron beam only illuminates correct phosphors on face tube holes are tapered so that electrons that strike inside any hole will be reflected back if they are not absorbed eg due local charge accumulation instead bouncing through hole strike random wrong spot on screen another type color crt uses aperture grille tensioned vertical wires achieve same result convergence purity color crts due limitations dimensional precision with which crts can be manufactured economically has not been practically possible build color crts which three electron beams could be aligned hit phosphors respective color acceptable coordination solely on basis geometric configuration electron gun axes gun aperture positions shadow mask apertures etc shadow mask ensures that one beam will only hit spots certain colors phosphors but minute variations physical alignment internal parts among individual crts will cause variations exact alignment beams through shadow mask allowing some electrons from for example red beam hit say blue phosphors unless some individual compensation made for variance among individual tubes color convergence color purity are two aspects this single problem firstly for correct color rendering necessary that regardless where beams are deflected on screen all three hit same spot nominally pass through same hole slot on shadow mask this called convergence more specifically convergence at center screen with no deflection field applied by yoke called static convergence convergence over rest screen area called dynamic convergence beams may converge at center screen yet stray from each other they are deflected toward edges such crt would be said have good static convergence but poor dynamic convergence secondly each beam must only strike phosphors color intended strike no others this called purity like convergence there static purity dynamic purity with same meanings static dynamic for convergence convergence purity are distinct parameters crt could have good purity but poor convergence vice versa poor convergence causes color shadows ghosts along displayed edges contours if image on screen were intaglio printed with poor registration poor purity causes objects on screen appear off-color while their edges remain sharp purity convergence problems can occur at same time same different areas screen both over whole screen either uniformly greater lesser degrees over different parts screen solution static convergence purity problems set color alignment magnets installed around neck crt these movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on back end deflection yoke assembly are set at factory compensate for any static purity convergence errors that are intrinsic unadjusted tube typically there are two three pairs two magnets form rings made plastic impregnated with magnetic material with their magnetic fields parallel planes magnets which are perpendicular electron gun axes each pair magnetic rings forms single effective magnet whose field vector can be fully freely adjusted both direction magnitude by rotating pair magnets relative each other their relative field alignment can be varied adjusting effective field strength pair they rotate relative each other each magnet's field can be considered have two opposing components at right angles these four components form two pairs one pair reinforcing each other other pair opposing canceling each other rotating away from alignment magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease they are traded for increasing opposed mutually cancelling components by rotating pair magnets together preserving relative angle between them direction their collective magnetic field can be varied overall adjusting all convergence/purity magnets allows finely tuned slight electron beam deflection lateral offset be applied which compensates for minor static convergence purity errors intrinsic uncalibrated tube once set these magnets are usually glued place but normally they can be freed readjusted field eg by tv repair shop if necessary on some crts additional fixed adjustable magnets are added for dynamic convergence dynamic purity at specific points on screen typically near corners edges further adjustment dynamic convergence purity typically cannot be done passively but requires active compensation circuits dynamic color convergence purity are one main reasons why until late their history crts were long-necked deep had biaxially curved faces these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence purity only starting around 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked flat-faced crts workable these active compensation circuits use deflection yoke finely adjust beam deflection according beam target location same techniques major circuit components also make possible adjustment display image rotation skew other complex raster geometry parameters through electronics under user control degaussing if shadow mask becomes magnetized its magnetic field deflects electron beams passing through causing color purity distortion beams bend through mask holes hit some phosphors color other than that which they are intended strike eg some electrons from red beam may hit blue phosphors giving pure red parts image magenta tint magenta additive combination red blue this effect localized specific area screen if magnetization shadow mask localized therefore important that shadow mask unmagnetized magnetized aperture grille has similar effect everything stated this subsection about shadow masks applies well aperture grilles most color crt displays ie television sets computer monitors each have built-in degaussing demagnetizing circuit primary component which degaussing coil which mounted around perimeter crt face inside bezel upon power-up crt display degaussing circuit produces brief alternating current through degaussing coil which smoothly decays strength fades out zero over period few seconds producing decaying alternating magnetic field from coil this degaussing field strong enough remove shadow mask magnetization most cases unusual cases strong magnetization where internal degaussing field not sufficient shadow mask may be degaussed externally with stronger portable degausser demagnetizer however excessively strong magnetic field whether alternating constant may mechanically deform bend shadow mask causing permanent color distortion on display which looks very similar magnetization effect degaussing circuit often built thermo-electric not electronic device containing small ceramic heating element positive thermal coefficient ptc resistor connected directly switched ac power line with resistor series with degaussing coil when power switched on heating element heats ptc resistor increasing its resistance point where degaussing current minimal but not actually zero older crt displays this low-level current which produces no significant degaussing field sustained along with action heating element long display remains switched on repeat degaussing cycle crt display must be switched off left off for at least several seconds reset degaussing circuit by allowing ptc resistor cool ambient temperature switching display-off immediately back on will result weak degaussing cycle effectively no degaussing cycle this simple design effective cheap build but wastes some power continuously later models especially energy star rated ones use relay switch entire degaussing circuit on off so that degaussing circuit uses energy only when functionally active needed relay design also enables degaussing on user demand through unit's front panel controls without switching unit off on again this relay can often be heard clicking off at end degaussing cycle few seconds after monitor turned on on off during manually initiated degaussing cycle vector monitors main article vector monitor vector monitors were used early computer aided design systems are some late-1970s mid-1980s arcade games such asteroids they draw graphics point-to-point rather than scanning raster either monochrome color crts can be used vector displays essential principles crt design operation are same for either type display main difference beam deflection patterns circuits crt resolution dot pitch defines maximum resolution display assuming delta-gun crts these scanned resolution approaches dot pitch resolution moiré appears detail being displayed finer than what shadow mask can render aperture grille monitors do not suffer from vertical moiré however because their phosphor stripes have no vertical detail smaller crts these strips maintain position by themselves but larger aperture-grille crts require one two crosswise horizontal support strips gamma crts have pronounced triode characteristic which results significant gamma nonlinear relationship electron gun between applied video voltage beam intensity other types cat's eye main article magic eye tube better quality old-fashioned tube radio sets tuning guide consisting phosphor tube was used aid tuning adjustment this was also known magic eye tuning eye tuning would be adjusted until width radial shadow was minimized this was used instead more expensive electromechanical meter which later came be used on higher-end tuners when transistor sets lacked high voltage required drive device same type device was used with tape recorders recording level meter for various other applications including electrical test equipment charactrons some displays for early computers those that needed display more text than was practical using vectors that required high speed for photographic output used charactron crts these incorporate perforated metal character mask stencil which shapes wide electron beam form character on screen system selects character on mask using one set deflection circuits but that causes extruded beam be aimed off-axis so second set deflection plates has re-aim beam so headed toward center screen third set plates places character wherever required beam unblanked turned on briefly draw character at that position graphics could be drawn by selecting position on mask corresponding code for space practice they were simply not drawn which had small round hole center this effectively disabled character mask system reverted regular vector behavior charactrons had exceptionally long necks because need for three deflection systems nimo main article nimo
