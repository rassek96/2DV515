history see also open source video game § history doom was one first major commercial games be released for linux linux gaming started largely extension already present unix gaming scene with both systems sharing many similar titles these games were either mostly original clones arcade games text adventures notable example this was so-called bsd games collection interactive fiction titles free software open source methodologies which spawned development operating system general also spawned creation various early free games popular early titles included nethack netrek xbill xevil xbattle xconq xpilot operating system itself grew expanded amount free open source games also increased scale complexity beginning linux gaming platform for commercial video games widely credited have begun when dave d taylor ported game doom linux well many other systems during his spare from there he would also help found development studio crack dot com which released video game abuse with game's linux port even being published by linux vendor red hat id software original developers doom also continued release their products for linux their game quake was ported linux once again by dave d taylor working his free time later id products continued be ported by david kirsch timothee besset respectively practice that continued until studio's acquisition by zenimax media dux software contracted don hopkins port simcity linux other early commercial linux games included hopkins fbi adventure game released by mp entertainment inner worlds which was released for mostly developed on linux two programmers from origin ported ultima online linux former loki software employee ryan c gordon on november new software firm called loki software was founded by scott draeker former lawyer who became interested porting games linux after being introduced system through his work software licensing attorney loki although commercial failure credited with birth modern linux game industry loki developed several free software tools such loki installer also known loki setup supported development simple directmedia layer well starting openal audio library project these are still often credited being cornerstones linux game development they were also responsible for bringing nineteen high-profile games platform before its closure loki's initial success also attracted other firms invest linux gaming market such tribsoft hyperion entertainment macmillan digital publishing usa titan computer xatrix entertainment philos laboratories vicarious visions during this time michael simms founded tux games one first online linux game retailers - we can observe that several well-known indie game companies eg cipsoft chronic logic illwinter game design introversion software s2 games started publish games for linux they are exceptions who successfully have ported sold games linux for such long period time after loki's closure linux game market experienced some changes although some new firms such linux game publishing runesoft would largely continue role standard porting house focus began change with linux game proponents encouraging game developers port their game products themselves through individual contractors influential this was ryan c gordon former loki employee who would over next decade port several game titles multiple platforms including linux around this time many companies starting with id software also began release legacy source code leading proliferation source ports older games linux other systems this also helped expand already existing free open source gaming scene especially with regards creation free first person shooters sales breakdown across systems first humble indie bundle by number purchasers top dollar value payments bottom linux gaming market also started experience some growth towards end decade with rise independent video game development with many indie developers favouring support for multiple platforms humble indie bundle initiatives helped formally demonstrate this trend with linux users representing sizable population their purchase base well consistently being most financially generous terms actual money spent release linux version desura digital distribution platform with primary focus on small independent developers was also heralded by several commentators important step greater acknowledgement linux gaming platform small indie game company entourev llc published voltley linux which first commercial exclusive game for this operating system same year lgp released shadowgrounds which was first commercial game for linux using nvidia physx middleware valve co-founder gabe newell has stated that linux open source are future gaming july game developer content distributor valve software announced port their source engine for linux well stating their intention release their steam digital distribution service for linux potential availability linux steam client has already attracted other developers consider porting their titles linux including previously mac os only porting houses such aspyr media feral interactive november unity technologies ported their unity engine game creation system linux starting with version all games created with unity engine can now be ported linux easily september valve announced that they were releasing gaming oriented linux based operating system called steamos with valve saying they had come conclusion that environment best suited delivering value customers operating system built around steam itself march gogcom announced they would begin support linux titles on their drm free store starting same year after previously stating they would not be able due too many distributions gogcom began their initial roll out on july by offering linux supporting titles including several new platform march april two major developers epic games crytek announced linux support for their next generation engines unreal engine cryengine respectively market share vs installed base see also linuxadoption § desktop linux adoption market share can be estimated based on sales numbers e g during q2 793% smartphones sold worldwide were running android when discussing free open-source software term installed base seems rather popular installation not embedment pre-installation that tailors product owner's personal needs unfortunately installed base opposed market share proves be tricky thing gauge surveys conducted by software such ubuntu software center steam can only tell about installed base particular program version hardware only on machines on which digital distribution software already installed first humble bundle sales linux accounted for 18% steam client tracks usage reported march that less than 12% users are using some form linux their platforms primary operating system may was below 1% unity game engine gathers user statistics showed march 04% linux users supported hardware linux gaming platform can also refer operating systems based on linux kernel specifically designed for sole purpose gaming examples are steamos which operating system for steam machines computers video game consoles built from components found classical home computer embedded operating systems like tizen pandora handheld game consoles like gp2x neo geo x nvidia shield runs android operating system which based on modified linux kernel open source design linux software platform allows operating system be compatible with various computer instruction sets many peripherals such game controllers head-mounted displays example oculus rift which upcoming virtual reality head-mounted display supports linux gaming platform performance tests by phoronix showed real-world performance games on linux with proprietary nvidia amd drivers were mostly comparable results on windows phoronix found similar results though ars technica described 20% performance drop with linux drivers mostly software engineers programmers who further compare performance these proprietary drivers with performance available free open-source graphics device drivers intel known for distributing their graphics drivers only free open-source software for all operating systems they support compared amd apus intel dedicates much less die-surface gpu software architecture operating system based on linux kernel customized specifically for gaming could adopt vanilla linux kernel with only little changes or—like android operating system—be based on relative extensively modified linux kernel could adopt gnu c library bionic something like entire middleware parts could very well be closed-source proprietary software same true for video games there are free open-source video games available for linux operating system well proprietary ones linux kernel subsystems already mainlined available linux kernel are most probably performant enough so not impede gaming experience any way however additional software available such eg brain fuck scheduler process scheduler budget fair queueing bfq scheduler i/o scheduler similar way linux kernel can be for example adapted run better on supercomputers there are adaptations targeted at improving performance games project concerning itself with this issue called liquorix available software for video game designers debuggers several game development tools have been available for linux including gnu debugger lldb valgrind glslang others vogl debugger for opengl was released on march see also game editor apitrace gtkradiant amd codexl open-source cross-platform clone enterbrain 's rpg maker xp vx called openrpg maker currently development available interfaces sdks there are couple interfaces software development kits available for linux almost all them are cross-platform most are free open-source software subject terms zlib license making possible static link against them from fully closed-source proprietary software one difficulty due this abundance interfaces difficulty for programmers choose best suitable audio api for their purpose main developer pulseaudio project lennart poettering commented on this issue physics engines audio libraries that are available modules for game engines have been available for linux for long time book programming linux games covers couple available apis suited for video game development for linux while linux programming interface covers

there also software which can be simply described middleware multitude companies exist worldwide whose main only product software that meant be licensed integrated into game engine their primary target video game industry but film industry also utilizes such software for special effects some very few well known examples are classical physics havok newton game dynamics physx audio audiokinetic wwise fmod other speedtree significant share available middleware already runs natively on linux only very few run exclusively on linux available ides source code editors numerous source code editors ides are available for linux among which are sublime text codeblocks qt creator emacs vim multi-monitor multi-monitor setup supported on linux at least by amd eyefinity & amd catalyst xinerama randr

kaveri desktop apu 3x1 portrait mode voice over ip specifications mumble protocol are freely available there are bsd-licensed implementations for both servers clients positional audio api mumble supported by eg cube sauerbraten wine main article wine software wine compatibility layer that provides binary compatibility makes possible run software that was written compiled for microsoft windows on linux wine project hosts user-submitted application database known wine appdb that lists programs games along with ratings reviews which detail how well they run with wine wine appdb also has commenting system which often includes instructions on how modify system run certain game which cannot run on normal default configuration many games are rated running flawlessly there are also many other games that can be run with varying degrees success use wine for gaming has proved controversial linux community some feel preventing at least hindering further growth native gaming on platform emulators there are numerous emulators for linux there are also apis virtual machines machine emulators that provide binary compatibility basilisk ii for macintosh dosbox dosemu for ms-dos/pc dos

several gaming peripherals also work with linux adoption by game engines this section may need be rewritten entirely comply with wikipedia's quality standards you can help discussion page may contain suggestions august game engine important for players developers alike development-kit build around game editors use build levels tools such blender 3ds max are employed create geometry object and/or animations those game data has reached enormous amounts while game engines are sometimes released under some free software license instead additionally licensing them game data usually not see also list game engines list game engine recreations distinction between game engine other related software game engine software ie some algorithms solely responsible for game mechanics thus there are completely different game engines for first-person shooters strategy video games etc besides game mechanics we also need software do calculations regarding graphics audio video physics vegetation input-handling you name computer games are considered be among most complex software there graphics for fps eg game mechanics calculates with vector data polygon mesh data this data needs be transformed into picture that can be sent computer monitor this called rendering well known rendering techniques used computer games are rasterisation real-time ray tracing software doing rendering called rendering engine rendering software completely distinct form game engine augments game engine but since almost any computer games are played via monitor rendering engine obligate since can be much more difficult program efficient rendering engine that some game engine instead pairing game engines with rendering engines done other way around audio audio effect other techniques require calculations well software doing such calculations could be called audio engine eg fmod software doing this soundrenderer well but not for computer games other software augmenting game engine most common term game engine middleware physics engine potential augmentation that can be incorporated by game engine well-known one havok various eg speedtree middleware solely concerned with trees euphoria middleware solely concerned with human body mechanics game editor software create game levels other game elements can be distinct such eg gtkradiant heavily interwoven with game engine software such cryengine that can be licensed much more than just game engine rather software suite that includes most above-mentioned software more when licensed by some 3rd party code for game engine probably one being adjusted most cryengine has more common with integrated development environment ide software development kit sdk than with mere game engine game engines that are used by many video
