game studies from wikipedia free encyclopedia   redirected from ludology jump navigation search not be confused with game theory game studies study games act playing them players cultures surrounding them discipline cultural studies that deals with all types games throughout history this field research utilizes tactics at least anthropology sociology psychology while examining aspects design game players game finally role game plays its society culture game studies oftentimes confused with study video games but this only one area focus reality game studies encompasses all types gaming including sports board games etc before video games game studies often only included anthropological work studying games past societies however once video games were introduced became mainstream game studies were updated perform sociological psychological observations observe effects gaming on individual his her interactions with society way could impact world around us there are three main approaches game studies social science approach asks itself how games affect people uses tools such surveys controlled lab experiments humanities approach asks itself what meanings are expressed through games uses tools such ethnography patient observation industrial engineering approach applies mostly video games less games general examines things such computer graphics artificial intelligence networking like other media disciplines such television film studies game studies often involves textual analysis audience theory contents history social sciences humanities industry engineering approach other areas research o video game pre-history o games aging o virtual economies gaming see also references o works cited further reading external links history before creation popularization video games late-twentieth century study games was mostly confined fields such anthropology studying games past civilizations some most popular examples ludology during these times are works such stewart culin’s comprehensive catalog native american games gaming implements north mexico johan huizinga roger caillois discussed importance gaming play societies culture even how may help define video games became more more popular 1980s so too did interest studying games rise wasn’t until gonzalo frasca popularized term ludology from latin word for game ludus publication first issue academic journal game studies creation digital games research association that scholars began get sense that study games could should be considered field its own right game studies young field gathers scholars from different disciplines that had been broadly studying games such psychology anthropology economy education sociology field's influences may be characterized broadly three ways social science approach humanities approach industry engineering approach addition asking different types questions each approach tends use different methods tools large body social scientists prefer quantitative tools methods while smaller group makes use qualitative research academics from humanities tend prefer tools methods that are qualitative industry approach practice-driven usually less concerned with theory than other two course these approaches are not mutually exclusive significant part game studies research blends them together tracy fullerton kenji ito’s work are examples interdisciplinary work being pursued game studies youth field game studies also another reason for blurred boundaries between approaches williams call for greater interdisciplinary work communications-oriented games scholarship noted how study videogames poised repeat mistakes past academic inquiry he argues that youth field means that not bound follow traditional divisions scholarly work that opportunity exists rediscover strengths contributions that different scholarly traditions can offer social sciences people studying researching social scientific approach game studies ludology ask themselves question “what do games do people” they conduct these studies perform this research by using resources such surveys controlled laboratory experiments ethnography researchers this field investigate both potential benefits potential detriments that gaming may have on populations one earliest social science theories about role video games society involved violence video games later becoming known catharsis theory theory suggests that playing video games which you perform violent acts might actually channel latent aggression resulting less aggression players real lives however meta-study performed by craig anderson brad j bushman examined data starting from 1980s up until article was published purpose this study was examine whether not playing violent video games led increase aggressive behaviors they concluded that exposure violence video games did indeed cause increase aggression however has been pointed out even stressed by psychologist jonathan freedman that this research was very limited even problematic since overly strong claims were made authors themselves seemed extremely biased their writings more recent studies such one performed by christopher j ferguson at texas a&m international university have come drastically different conclusions this study individuals were either randomly assigned game allowed choose game both randomized choice conditions exposure violent video games caused no difference aggression later study performed by same people looked for correlations between trait aggression violent crimes exposure both real life violence violence video games this study suggests that while family violence trait aggression are highly correlated with violent crime exposure video game violence was not good predictor violent crime having little no correlation unless also paired with above traits that had much higher correlation over past years large number meta-studies have been applied this issue each coming its own conclusion resulting little consensus ludology community for positive effects educators learning scientists have also debated how leverage motivation students had for playing games well exploring medium video games for educational pedagogical purposes malone explored intrinsically motivating qualities that games have how they might be useful designing educational games malone malone lepper recommended four main heuristics namely challenge fantasy curiosity control for game designers researchers improve user interaction interface kafai had schoolchildren design games learn computer programming mathematics concepts kafai similarly squire has explored use commercial games means for engaging disenfranchised students school squire while gerber has explored how video games shape students' peripheral literacy activities mainly reading writing both online offline spaces gerber gerber & price addition their motivational factors gee shaffer have argued that certain qualities present medium video games provide valuable opportunities for learning gee shaffer game designers amy jo kim jane mcgonigal have suggested that platforms which leverage powerful qualities video games non-game contexts can maximize learning known gamification learning using game elements non-game contexts extracts properties games from within game context applies them learning context such classroom another positive aspect video games its conducive character towards involvement person other cultural activities probability game playing increases with consumption other cultural goods eg listening music watching television active involvement artistic activities eg writing visual arts production video games by being complementary towards more traditional forms cultural consumption inhibit thus value from cultural perspective more sociologically-informed research has sought move away from simplistic ideas gaming either 'negative' 'positive' but rather seeking understand its role location complexities everyday life garry crawford for example her book life on screen sherry turkle explored how people who participated online multiplayer games such muds used their experiences with game explore personal issues identity turkle her book play between worlds t l taylor documents her ethnography massively multiplayer online game everquest doing so she seeks understand nuanced border relationship that exists between mmog players game worlds they inhabit economists are also studying massive multiplayer online games understand human behavior better economic activity these games being studied one would study economy real-earth nation castronova different theories such coordination game theory can be put test because games can produce contexts for natural experiments high number participants well tightly controlled experimental conditions castronova from this perspective games provide unique context which human activity may be explored better understood for example has been suggested that very popular mmo world warcraft could be used study dissemination infectious diseases because accidental spread plague-like disease gameworld humanities this section needs

message question that ludologists humanities field ask themselves “what meanings are expressed through game player” they conduct these studies by using methods like interviews ethnographies observations players they progress through game purpose this field ludology investigate role that gaming may play peoples lives be they hardcore casual gamers what meanings players may extract from their experiences with different games for example consalvo explores how players choose play games they buy negotiate how when for what reasons subvert game’s rules turns out that cheating complex phenomenon whose meaning continually negotiated by players game industry various gaming subcultures that revolve around specific games however this particular field has also caused lot controversy ludology known ‘ludology vs narratology’ debates narratological perspective that games should be looked at for their stories like movies novels while ludological perspective says that games are not like these other mediums due fact that player actively taking part experience should therefore be understood on their own terms there third party however that says separating scholars into different camps not good idea can hurt field whole idea that videogame radically different narratives cognitive communicative structure has led development new approaches criticism that are focused on videogames well adapting repurposing proposing new ways studying theorizing about videogames recent approach towards game studies starts with analysis interface structures challenges keyboard-mouse paradigm with what called ludic interface other researchers have focused on understanding videogames cultural artifacts with embedded meaning exploring what medium videogame situating context other forms human expression brenda laurel’s book computers theatre while principally focused on applying tenets theatre criticism design human-computer interfaces describes how videogames are natural result capacity represent action which humans could participate computers rather than considering computer highly efficient tool for calculating computing she proposed understanding computer medium thesis her book attempts draw parallels between drama computer with computers allowing their users play equivalent roles both drama performer well audience member throughout her book laurel uses different videogames exemplars many ideas principles henry jenkins on other hand explores role that videogames play broader context he refers transmedia storytelling jenkins' view content moves between different media videogames are part general ecology storytelling media that include movies novels comic books jenkins similarly janet murray’s hamlet on holodeck describes computer new medium for practice storytelling by analyzing videogames along with other digital artifacts such hypertext interactive chat characters murray explores new expressive possibilities allowed by computers particular she views videogames part expanded concept storytelling she calls cyberdrama espen aarseth his book cybertext disagrees with murray’s idea holds claim there no difference between games narratives ignore essential qualities both categories aarseth jesper juul's half-real explores how videogames blend formal rules with imaginative experiences provided by fictional worlds he describes tensions faced by games studies scholars when choosing focus on game player game we can examine rules they are found mechanically game program manual board game we can examine rules something that players negotiate learn we can also treat fictional world set signs that game presents we can treat fictional world something that game cues player into imagining that players then imagine their own way ian bogost's comparative approach videogame criticism also stands out one more recent steps direction proposing new ways studying theorizing about games unit operations he argues for explicating videogames through new form criticism that encompasses programmatic algorithmic underpinnings games together with cultural ideological units studies on video games sexuality suggests that exposure sexualized phantasmagorias females video games might consequence gender stereotyping females by both males females industry engineering approach industry engineering approach perhaps hardest three approaches present from engineering perspective videogames have been context for wide variety technological innovations advancements areas such computer graphics artificial intelligence networking while research pursued these areas mostly not about games quite common for videogames be used context which demonstrate solutions problems solved counter-example above mateas stern’s façade interactive drama whose design development resulted contributions field ai mateas mateas stern from industry perspective lot game studies research can be seen academic response videogame industry’s questions regarding products creates sells main question this approach deals with can be summarized how can we create better games with accompanying what makes game good good can be taken mean many different things does game provide entertaining engaging experience player game easy for some players challenging enough learn play game innovative does provide player with novel experiences different approaches studying this problem have looked at describing how design games crawford rollings morris rouse iii extracting guidelines rules thumb for making better games fabricatore et al falstein abstracting commonalities from games understanding how they relate each other björk holopainen zagal et al studying gaming experience from player's point view pagulayan et al sykes brown koster much this research also dedicated defining constructing vocabulary for describing games thinking through design new ones church kreimeier industrial approach can be characterized design product driven methodologically wide variety approaches have been taken most often they are attempts re-imagine existing practices other fields industries videogame industry pagulayan colleagues for example have worked on developing tools practices for evaluating usability games pagulayan et al while bjork holopainen borrowing from literature on software patterns software engineering toward creating patterns for gameplay also bateman boon using myers–briggs type indicator have conducted research create tools help guide design games for certain demographic groups by incorporating elements specifically designed meet their needs other areas research common with most academic disciplines there are number more specialized areas sub-domains study video game pre-history emerging field study oliver grau others looks at pre-history video games suggesting that origins modern digital games lie fairground attractions sideshows such shooting games early coney island-style pleasure parks with elements such large roller-coasters haunted house simulations nineteenth century landscape simulations such dioramas panoramas planetariums stereographs amusement arcades that had mechanical game machines also peep-show film machines games aging light population ageing there has been interest into use games improve overall health social connectedness ageing players for example adam gazzaley his team have designed neuroracer game that improves cognitive tasks outside game among its 60+ year old participants while aarp has organized game jam improve older people's social connections researchers such sarah mosberg iversen have argued that most academic work on games ageing has been informed by notions economical productivity iversen while bob de schutter vero vanden abeele have suggested game design approach that not focused on age-related decline but instead rooted positive aspects older age de schutter & vanden abeele virtual economies gaming main article virtual economy massive multiplayer online games can give economists clues about real world markets based on digital information can be fully tracked they are used by players thus real problems economy such inflation deflation even recession solutions game designers come up with can therefore be studied with full information experiments can be performed where economy can be studied whole these games allow economists be omniscient they can find every piece information they need study economy while real world they have work with presumptions former finance minister greece valve's in-house economist yanis varoufakis studied eve online argued that video game communities give economists venue for experimenting simulating economies future see also art game video game art video games art form references
