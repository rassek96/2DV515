criterion filling horizontal line tile-matching video game type puzzle video game where player manipulates tiles order make them disappear according matching criterion many tile-matching games that criterion place given number tiles same type so that they adjoin each other that number often three corresponding subset tile-matching games referred match-three games core challenge tile-matching games identification patterns on seemingly chaotic board their origins lie late 1980s games such tetris chain shot samegame puzznic tile-matching games were made popular 2000s form casual games distributed played over internet notably bejeweled series games they have remained popular since with game candy crush saga becoming most-played game on facebook tile-matching games cover broad range design elements mechanics gameplay experiences they include purely turn-based games but may also feature arcade-style action elements such time pressure shooting hand-eye coordination tile matching mechanic also minor feature some larger games video game researcher jesper juul therefore considers tile matching be game mechanic rather than distinct genre games contents history features o timing o tile arrangement manipulation matching o scoring o victory loss significance computational complexity list bibliography references history mechanism matching game pieces make them disappear feature many non-digital games including mahjong solitaire solitaire card games jesper juul traces history tile-matching video games back tetris chain shot both published while both focus on pattern matching they differ important design points such time pressure tile manipulation match criteria second generation influential matching games – puzznic columns dr mario plotting – was published games building on dr mario's mechanics include puyo puyo baku baku animal puzzle fighter building on shooting mechanic introduced plotting dr mario also influenced puzzle bobble which turn inspired puzz loop hexic zuma luxor columns was basis line development tile matching games based on shifting swapping tiles includes yoshi's cookie panel de pon which introduced swapping mechanic first what eventually became known match three games where goal create clusters three more identical items on grid was shariki led directly successful bejeweled which became series inspired similar games including zoo keeper big kahuna reef jewel quest chuzzle many casual tile matching games continue be published their development characterized by gradual evolution where new games makes only small changes if any formula known from previous games highly competitive market for downloadable casual games new entries must be familiar enough appeal players earlier games but innovative enough differentiate new game from earlier ones this leads developers according juul simultaneously trying out-innovate out-clone each other features tile-matching games that are set fictional background are normally based bright positive fiction opposed warlike background strategy games fantasy background massively multiplayer games tile matching game mechanics have been combined with other mechanics produce great variety puzzle game experiences this section discusses number these mechanics timing many tile-matching games are timed – that new tiles are continuously added player under pressure make matches before board fills up untimed turn-based games which new tiles are added only after player has made move used be exception although game chain shot already had untimed mode addition untimed mode bejeweled was integral that game's success well one its most important influences on subsequent games made game more accessible less skilled players tile arrangement manipulation matching tiles may be arranged on horizontal surface vertically that stacked atop one another dropping down when tiles below are removed latter case some games allow moving rotating new tiles they fall down from top playing area tetris dr mario they may allow only manipulation tiles that have already fallen yoshi's cookie panel de pon introduced bejeweled popularized mechanism tile swapping which tiles may be moved by exchanging position two adjacent tiles another frequently used tile manipulation method having player shoot tiles onto board such plotting its descendants including zuma first method which allows only moves that create match results more strategic thoughtful style play whereas second method requires hand-eye coordination addition pattern recognition skills makes for more hectic style play tetris its derivatives are somewhat unusual that they feature irregularly shaped tiles composed squares which match with all other tiles no matter what their color other games tiles are most often uniformly square round are distinguished for purpose matching by color some other decoration this shifts game's focus towards pattern recognition away from act manipulating tiles tetris's matching criterion filling full line on board has not been taken up by most other tile-matching games most games match occurs when given number often three more tiles same type adjoin each other at that time they are removed from board great number gameplay variations are possible by introducing special tiles that behave differently such by being indestructible by destroying surrounding tiles when involved match scoring most tile-matching games players obtain points for each match higher scores are awarded for more difficult matches such those involving greater number similar tiles victory loss most tile-matching games new tiles are randomly added board continuously either turn by turn real time this may continue indefinitely for given period time number turns player must continuously remove newly added tiles through matching game may end with loss when board filled with tiles if there are no more possible matches may end with victory when player clears board reaches given score significance among downloadable casual video games according survey referred by juul tile-matching games were second most popular game type by far most popular after that their popularity declined they were fourth most popular several genres games publisher referred them niche genre but they became well known therefore assumed be immediately playable by many people tile-matching games migrated other more ubiquitous distribution channels such cell phones smartphones despite their commercial popularity tile-matching games are among games with lowest status among video game enthusiasts point where reviewers have advised gamers not be ashamed playing them this may be because critics consider that there are too many these games which differ only slightly from each other may also be because casual games tile-matching games are designed be easily accessible easy play which conflicts with traditional video gaming ethos that demands games be challenging punishing computational complexity bejeweled
