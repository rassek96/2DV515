chiptunes which combines simple melodic styles with more complex patterns traditional music styles became most popular sound first video games with advances technology video game music has now grown include same breadth complexity associated with television film scores allowing for much more creative freedom while simple synthesizer pieces are still common game music now includes full orchestral

video game technology computer chip music see also chiptune original synthesized composition imitating early video game music ------------------------------------------------------------------------ problems playing this file see media help at time video games had emerged popular form entertainment late 1970s golden age arcade video games second-generation consoles music was stored on physical medium analog waveforms such compact cassettes phonograph records such components were expensive prone breakage under heavy use making them less than ideal for use arcade cabinet though rare cases they were used journey more affordable method having music video game was use digital means where specific computer chip would change electrical impulses from computer code into analog sound waves on fly for output on speaker sound effects for games were also generated this fashion early example such approach video game music was opening chiptune tomohiro nishikado's gun fight 1975also games have original soundtracks that people remember back 80s while this allowed for inclusion music early arcade video games was usually monophonic looped used sparingly between stages at start new game such namco titles pac-man composed by toshio kai pole position composed by nobuyuki ohnogi first game use continuous background soundtrack was tomohiro nishikado 's space invaders released by taito had four descending chromatic bass notes repeating loop though was dynamic interacted with player increasing pace enemies descended on player first video game feature continuous melodic background music was rally-x released by namco featuring simple tune that repeats continuously during gameplay decision include any music into video game meant that at some point would have be transcribed into computer code by programmer whether not programmer had musical experience some music was original some was public domain music such folk songs sound capabilities were limited popular atari home system for example was capable generating only two tones notes at time advances were made silicon technology costs fell definitively new generation arcade machines home consoles allowed for great changes accompanying music arcades machines based on motorola cpu accompanying various yamaha ym programmable sound generator sound chips allowed for several more tones channels sound sometimes eight more earliest known example this was sega's arcade game carnival which used ay-3-8910 chip create electronic rendition classical composition over waves by juventino rosas konami's arcade game frogger introduced dynamic approach video game music using at least eleven different gameplay tracks addition level-starting game over themes which change according player's actions this was further improved upon by namco's arcade game dig dug where music stopped when player stopped moving dig dug was composed by yuriko keino who also composed music for other namco games such xevious phozon sega's arcade game super locomotive featured chiptune rendition yellow magic orchestra's rydeen several later computer games also covered song such trooper truck by rabbit software well daley thompson's decathlon stryker's run composed by martin galway home console systems also had comparable upgrade sound ability beginning with colecovision capable four channels however more notable was japanese release famicom which was later released us nintendo entertainment system was capable five channels one being capable simple pcm sampled sound home computer commodore released was capable early forms filtering effects different types waveforms eventually ability play 4-bit samples on fourth sound channel its comparatively low cost made popular alternative other home computers well its ability use tv for affordable display monitor approach game music development this time period usually involved using simple tone generation and/or frequency modulation synthesis simulate instruments for melodies use noise channel for simulating percussive noises early use pcm samples this era was limited short sound bitesmonopoly alternate for percussion sounds super mario bros music on home consoles often had share available channels with other sound effects for example if laser beam was fired by spaceship laser used hz tone then whichever channel was use by music would stop playing music start playing sound effect mid-to-late 1980s software releases for these platforms had music developed by more people with greater musical experience than before quality composition improved noticeably evidence popularity music this time period remains even today composers who made name for themselves with their software include koichi sugiyama dragon quest nobuo uematsu final fantasy rob hubbard monty on run international karate koji kondo super mario bros legend zelda miki higashino gradius yie-ar kung fu teenage mutant ninja turtles hiroshi kawaguchi space harrier hang-on out run hirokazu tanaka metroid kid icarus earthbound martin galway daley thompson's decathlon stryker's run times lore yuzo koshiro dragon slayer ys shinobi actraiser streets rage mieko ishikawa dragon slayer ys ryu umemoto visual novels shoot 'em ups by late 1980s video game music was being sold cassette tape soundtracks japan inspiring american companies such sierra cinemaware interplay give more serious attention video game music by golden joystick awards introduced category for best soundtrack year won by sanxion near end life-cycle famicom some game producers at their own expense custom manufactured their cartridges with additional tone generating chip these chips added existing sound chip famicom but also sported extra features modulate additional channels early digital synthesis sampling see also chiptune from around some arcade games began taking steps toward digitized sampled sounds namco's arcade game rally-x was first known game use digital-to-analog converter dac produce sampled tones instead tone generator that same year first known video game feature speech synthesis was also released sunsoft's shoot 'em up game stratovox around same time introduction frequency modulation synthesis fm synthesis first commercially released by yamaha for their digital synthesizers fm sound chips allowed tones be manipulated have different sound characteristics where before tone generated by chip was limited design chip itself konami 's arcade game gyruss used five synthesis sound chips along with dac which were somewhat used create electronic version j s bach 's toccata fugue d minor beyond arcade games significant improvements personal computer game music were made possible with introduction digital fm synth boards which yamaha released for japanese computers such nec pc-8801 pc-9801 early 1980s by mid-1980s pc-8801 fm-7 had built-in fm sound this allowed computer game music have greater complexity than simplistic beeps from internal speakers these fm synth boards produced warm pleasant sound that musicians such yuzo koshiro takeshi abo utilized produce music that still highly regarded within chiptune community widespread adoption fm synthesis by consoles would later be one major advances 16-bit era by which time 16-bit arcade machines were using multiple fm synthesis chips one earliest home computers make use digital signal processing form sampling was commodore amiga computer's sound chip featured four independent 8-bit digital-to-analog converters developers could use this platform take samples music performance sometimes just single note long play back through computer's sound chip from memory this differed from rally-x that its hardware dac was used play back simple waveform samples sampled sound allowed for complexity authenticity real instrument that fm simulation could not offer for its role being one first affordable amiga would remain staple tool early sequenced music composing especially europe amiga offered these features before other competing home computer platforms amiga's main rival atari st sourced yamaha ym2149 programmable sound generator psg compared in-house designed amiga sound engine psg could only handle channel sampled sound needed computer's cpu process data for this made impractical for game development use until with release atari ste which used dma techniques play back pcm samples at up khz st however remained relevant was equipped with midi controller external ports became choice by many professional musicians midi programming device ibm pc clones would not see any significant development multimedia abilities for few more years sampling would not become popular other video game systems for several years though sampling had potential produce much more realistic sounds each sample required much more data memory this was at time when all memory solid state rom cartridge magnetic floppy disk otherwise was still very costly per kilobyte sequenced soundchip generated music on other hand was generated with few lines comparatively simple code took up far less precious memory arcade systems pushed game music forward with introduction fm frequency modulation synthesis providing more realistic sounds than previous psgs first such game marble madness used yamaha ym2151 fm synthesis chip home consoles moved into fourth generation 16-bit era hybrid approach sampled tone music composing continued be used sega genesis offered advanced graphics over nes improved sound synthesis features also using yamaha chip ym2612 but largely held same approach sound design ten channels total for tone generation with one for pcm samples were available stereo instead nes's five channels mono one for pcm before was often used for percussion samples genesis did not support 16-bit sampled sounds despite additional tone channels writing music still posed challenge traditional composers forced much more imaginative use fm synthesizer create enjoyable listening experience composer yuzo koshiro utilized genesis hardware effectively produce progressive catchy techno-style compositions far more advanced than what players were used for games such revenge shinobi streets rage series setting new high watermark for what music games could sound like soundtrack for streets rage particular considered revolutionary ahead its time for its blend house music with dirty electro basslines trancey electronic textures that would feel comfortable nightclub video game another important fm synth composer was late ryu umemoto who composed music for many visual novels shoot 'em ups during 1990s cost magnetic memory declined form diskettes evolution video game music on amiga some years later game music development general shifted sampling some form took some years before amiga game designers learned wholly use digitized sound effects music early exception case was title music text adventure game pawn by this time computer game music had already begun form its own identity thus many music makers intentionally tried produce music that sounded like that heard on commodore nes which resulted chiptune genre unreal introduction theme flight castle excerpt from intro theme unreal composed by alexander brandon with impulse tracker tracker for dos platform ------------------------------------------------------------------------ problems playing this file see media help release freely-distributed amiga program named soundtracker by karsten obarski started era mod-format which made easy for anyone produce music based on digitized samples module files were made with programs called trackers after obarski's soundtracker this mod/tracker tradition continued with pc computers 1990s examples amiga games using digitized instrument samples include david whittaker's soundtrack for shadow beast chris hülsbeck's soundtrack for turrican matt furniss's tunes for laser squad richard joseph also composed some theme songs featuring vocals lyrics for games by sensible software most famous being cannon fodder with song war has never been so much fun sensible world soccer with song goal scoring superstar hero these songs used long vocal samples similar approach sound music developments had become common arcades by this time had been used many arcade system boards since mid-1980s this was further popularized early 1990s by games like street fighter ii on cps-1 which used voice samples extensively along with sampled sound effects percussion neo geo's mvs system also carried powerful sound development which often included surround sound super nes brought digitized sound console games evolution also carried into home console video games such release super famicom its us/eu version super nes sported specialized custom sony chip for both sound generation for special hardware dsp was capable eight channels sampled sounds at up 16-bit resolution had wide selection dsp effects including type adsr usually seen high end synthesizers time full stereo sound this allowed experimentation with applied acoustics video games such musical acoustics early games like super castlevania iv f-zero final fantasy iv gradius iii later games like chrono trigger directional star fox spatial acoustics dolby pro-logic was used some games like king arthur's world jurassic park well environmental architectural acoustics zelda iii secret evermore many games also made heavy use high quality sample playback capabilities super star wars tales phantasia only real limitation this powerful setup was still-costly solid state memory other consoles generation could boast similar abilities yet did not have same circulation levels super nes neo-geo home system was capable same powerful sample processing its arcade counterpart but was several times cost super nes sega cd mega cd outside north america hardware upgrade mega drive genesis us offered multiple pcm channels but they were often passed over instead use its capabilities with cd-rom itself popularity super nes its software remained limited regions where ntsc television was broadcast standard partly because difference frame rates pal broadcast equipment many titles released were never redesigned play appropriately ran much slower than originally intended were never released this showed divergence popular video game music between pal ntsc countries that still shows this day this divergence would be lessened fifth generation home consoles launched globally commodore began take back seat general purpose pcs macs for developing gaming though mega cd/sega cd greater extent pc engine japan would give gamers preview direction video game music would take streaming music use both sampled sequenced music continues game consoles even today huge data storage benefit optical media would be coupled with progressively more powerful audio generation hardware higher quality samples fifth generation cd-rom equipped playstation supported channels 16-bit samples up khz sample rate samples equal cd audio quality also sported few hardware dsp effects like reverb many square titles continued use sequenced music such final fantasy legend mana final fantasy tactics sega saturn also with cd drive supported channels pcm at same resolution original playstation nintendo still using solid state cartridge actually supported integrated scalable sound system that was potentially capable channels pcm improved sample rate khz games for n64 because cost solid state memory typically had samples lesser quality than other two however music tended be simpler construct more dominant approach for games based on cds however was shifting toward streaming audio midi on pc first developers ibm pc computers neglected audio capabilities first ibm model same timeframe late 1980s mid-1990s ibm pc clones using x86 architecture became more ubiquitous yet had very different path sound design than other pcs consoles early pc gaming was limited pc speaker some proprietary standards such ibm pcjr 3-voice chip while sampled sound could be achieved on pc speaker using pulse width modulation doing so required significant proportion available processor power rendering its use games rare with increase x86 pcs market there was vacuum sound performance home computing that expansion cards attempted fill first two recognizable standards were roland mt-32 followed by adlib sound card roland's solution was driven by midi sequencing using advanced la synthesizers this made first choice for game developers produce upon but its higher cost end-user solution made prohibitive adlib used low-cost fm synthesis chip from yamaha many boards could operate compatibly using midi standard adlib card was usurped by creative's sound blaster which used same yamaha fm chip adlib for compatibility but also added 8-bit khz later khz digital audio recording playback single stereo channel affordable end-user product sound blaster constituted core sound technology early 1990s combination simple fm engine that supported midi dac engine one more streams only minority developers ever used amiga-style tracker formats commercial pc games unreal typically preferring use mt-32 adlib/sb-compatible devices general purpose pcs using x86 became more ubiquitous than other pc platforms developers drew their focus towards that platform last major development before streaming music came roland corporation released first general midi card sample-based scc-1 add-in card version sc-55 desktop midi module comparative quality samples spurred similar offerings from soundblaster but costs for both products were still high both companies offered 'daughterboards' with sample-based synthesizers that could be later added less expensive soundcard which only had dac midi controller give features fully integrated card unlike standards amiga atari pc using x86 even then could be using broad mix hardware developers increasingly used midi sequences instead writing soundtrack data for each type soundcard they generally wrote fully featured data set for roland application that would be compatible with lesser featured equipment so long had midi controller run sequence however different products used different sounds attached their midi controllers some tied into yamaha fm chip simulate instruments some daughterboards samples had very different sound qualities meaning that no single sequence performance would be accurate every other general midi device all these considerations products reflected high cost memory storage which rapidly declined with optical cd format pre-recorded streaming music main article streaming audio video games taking entirely pre-recorded music had many advantages over sequencing for sound quality music could be produced freely with any kind number instruments allowing developers simply record one track be played back during game quality was only limited by effort put into mastering track itself memory space costs that was previously concern was somewhat addressed with optical media becoming dominant media for software games cd quality audio allowed for music voice that had potential be truly indistinguishable from any other source genre music fourth generation home video games pcs this was limited playing mixed mode cd audio track from cd while game was play such sonic cd earliest examples mixed mode cd audio video games include turbografx-cd rpg franchises tengai makyō composed by ryuichi sakamoto from ys series composed by yuzo koshiro mieko ishikawa arranged by ryo yonemitsu ys soundtracks particularly ys i & ii are still regarded some most influential video game music ever composed however there were several disadvantages regular cd-audio optical drive technology was still limited spindle speed so playing audio track from game cd meant that system could not access data again until stopped track from playing looping most common form game music was also problem when laser reached end track had move itself back beginning start reading again causing audible gap playback address these drawbacks some pc game developers designed their own container formats house for each application some cases stream compressed audio this would cut back on memory used for music on cd allowed for much lower latency seek time when finding starting play music also allowed for much smoother looping due being able buffer data minor drawback was that use compressed audio meant had be decompressed which put load on cpu system computing power increased this load became minimal some cases dedicated chips computer such sound card would actually handle all decompressing fifth generation home console systems also developed specialised streaming formats containers for compressed audio playback games would take full advantage this ability sometimes with highly praised results castlevania symphony night games ported from arcade machines which continued use fm synthesis often saw superior pre-recorded music streams on their home console counterparts street fighter alpha even though game systems were capable cd quality sound these compressed audio tracks were not true cd quality many them had lower sampling rates but not so significant that most consumers would notice using compressed stream allowed game designers play back streamed music still be able access other data on disc without interruption music at cost cpu power used render audio stream manipulating stream any further would require far more significant level cpu power available 5th generation some games such wipeout series continued use full mixed mode cd audio for their soundtracks this overall freedom offered music composers gave video game music equal footing with other popular music had lacked musician could now with no need learn about programming game architecture itself independently produce music their satisfaction this flexibility would be exercised popular mainstream musicians would be using their talents for video games specifically early example way warrior on 3do with music by white zombie more well-known example trent reznor's score for quake alternate approach with tmnt arcade was take pre-existing music not written exclusively for game use game game star wars x-wing vs tie fighter subsequent star wars games took music composed by john williams for star wars films 1970s 1980s used for game soundtracks both using new music streams made specifically for game using previously released/recorded music streams are common approaches for developing sound tracks this day common for x-games sports-based video games come with some popular artists recent releases ssx tony hawk initial d well any game with heavy cultural demographic theme that has tie-in music need for speed underground gran turismo grand theft auto sometimes hybrid two are used such dance dance revolution sequencing samples continue be used modern gaming for many uses mostly rpgs sometimes cross between sequencing samples streaming music used games such republic revolution music composed by james hannigan command & conquer generals music composed by bill brown have utilised sophisticated systems governing flow incidental music by stringing together short phrases based on action on screen player's most recent choices see dynamic music other games dynamically mixed sound on game based on cues game environment processing power increased dramatically 6th generation home consoles became possible apply special effects realtime streamed audio ssx recent video game series if snowboarder takes air after jumping from ramp music softens muffles bit ambient noise wind air blowing becomes louder emphasize being airborne when snowboarder lands music resumes regular playback until its next cue lucasarts company pioneered this interactive music technique with their imuse system used their early adventure games star wars flight simulators star wars x-wing star wars tie fighter action games such these will change dynamically match amount danger stealth-based games will sometimes rely on such music either by handling streams differently dynamically changing composition sequenced soundtrack personalized soundtracks being able play one's own music during game past usually meant turning down game audio using alternative music player some early exceptions were possible on pc/windows gaming which was possible independently adjust game audio while playing music with separate program running background some pc games such quake play music from cd while retrieving game data exclusively from hard disk thereby allowing game cd be swapped for any music cd first pc game introduce in-game support for custom soundtracks was lionhead studio's black white game included in-game interface for winamp that enabled players play audio tracks from their own playlists addition this would sometimes trigger various reactions from player's creature like dancing laughing some playstation games supported this by swapping game cd with music cd although when game needed data players had swap cds again one earliest games ridge racer was loaded entirely into ram letting player insert music cd provide soundtrack throughout entirety gameplay vib ribbon this became gameplay feature with game generating levels based entirely on music on whatever cd player inserted microsoft's xbox competitor sixth generation home consoles opened new possibilities its ability copy music from cd onto its internal hard drive allowed gamers use their own music more seamlessly with gameplay than ever before feature called custom soundtrack had be enabled by game developer feature carried over into seventh generation with xbox except now supported by system software enabled at any point wii also able play custom soundtracks if enabled by game excite truck endless ocean playstation portable can games like need for speed carbon own city fifa play music from memory stick playstation has ability utilize custom soundtracks games using music saved on hard drive however few game developers have used this function so far mlb show released north america on march has my mlb sound track feature which allows user play music tracks their choice saved on hard drive their ps3 rather than preprogrammed tracks incorporated into game by developer update wipeout hd released on playstation network was made also incorporate this feature audiosurf custom soundtracks are main aspect game users have pick music file be analyzed game will generate race track based on tempo pitch complexity sound user will then race on this track synchronized with music grand theft auto games have also been noted support custom soundtracks by using them for separate radio station called mp3 player station which itself later changed names later games for example user track player grand theft auto san andreas independence fm grand theft auto iv self radio grand theft auto v feature was primarily exclusive pc versions initially taking into consideration ability for pc hard drives better support user tracks however feature adopted limited scale on two console platforms feature was first seen technically inserting custom music into stations consists simply placing music files into designated folder

andreas shortcuts music files/folders may also be placed user tracks folder located its gta user files folders within my documents grand theft auto iv follows san andreas' system designating user music folder its my documents user files folder for custom music however methods for inserting user-defined tracks console ports are more varied for xbox version cd must be installed into console's hard drive for iphone version grand theft auto chinatown wars players simply create itunes playlist titled gta assigning playlist game manner which custom music then played stations varies game by game gta iii gta vice city music tracks will be played alphabetical order according their file names cannot be skipped gta san andreas however offers option playing music files sequential order on

described video game genre some aspects this style continue influence certain music today though gamers do not associate many modern game soundtracks with older style genre's compositional elements largely developed due technological restraints while also being influenced by electronic music bands particularly yellow magic orchestra ymo who were popular during late 1970s 1980s ymo sampled sounds from several classic arcade games their early albums most notably space invaders hit song computer game turn band would have major influence on much video game music produced during 8-bit 16-bit eras features video game music genre include pieces designed repeat indefinitely rather than having arranged ending fading out pieces lacking lyrics playing over gameplay sounds limited polyphony only three notes can be played simultaneously on nintendo entertainment system great deal effort was put into composition create illusion more notes playing at once although tones featured nes music can be thought emulating traditional four-piece rock band triangle wave used bass two pulse waves analogous two guitars white noise channel used for drums composers would often go out their way compose complex rapid sequences notes part due restrictions mentioned above this similar music composition during baroque period when composers particularly when creating solo pieces focused on musical embellishments compensate for instruments such harpsichord that do not allow for expressive dynamics for same reason many early compositions also feature distinct jazz influence these would overlap with later influences from heavy metal j-pop music resulting equally distinct compositional style 16-bit era unrelated but parallel course european north american developer scene similar limitations were driving musical style home computer games module file format music particularly mod used similar techniques but was more heavily influenced from electronic music scene developed resulted another very distinct subgenre demos developing demoscene played big part early years still influence video game music today technological limitations gradually lifted composers were given more freedom with advent cd-rom pre-recorded soundtracks came dominate resulting noticeable shift composition voicing style popular early cd-rom titles were released with high-resolution graphics recorded music since audio was not reliant on sound-card's synthesis cd-rom technology ensured that composers sound designers could know what audio would sound like on most consumer configurations could also record sound effects live instruments vocals in-game dialogue divisions between movies video games has blurred so have divisions between film scores video game scores adventure fantasy movies have similar needs adventure fantasy games ie fanfare traveling hero's theme so on some composers have written scores both genres one noted example us composer michael giacchino who composed soundtrack for game medal honor later composed for television series lost wrote scores for movies such incredibles star trek video game music outside video games see also chiptune appreciation for video game music strong among fans composers particularly for music from third fourth generations home video game consoles sometimes newer generations this appreciation has been shown outside context video game form cds sheet

actraiser soundtrack both koshiro's fellow falcom composer mieko ishikawa's contributions ys music would have such long lasting impact that there were more albums released ys music than almost all other game-type music like anime soundtracks these soundtracks even sheet music books were usually marketed exclusively japan therefore interested non-japanese gamers had import soundtracks and/or
