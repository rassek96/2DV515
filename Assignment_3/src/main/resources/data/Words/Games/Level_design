discipline profession dedicated solely level design did not exist early games often featured level system ascending difficulty opposed progression story-line first game genre that required significant amounts time design areas were text-based games such muds often promoted users were assigned create new paths new rooms new equipment new actions often using game interface itself zzt another early game notable for its user-accessible mapping event triggering/scripting 1983's lode runner was one first titles ship with level editor its designer douglas smith reputedly paid neighborhood children design levels for game doom doom ii were two first games attract focused game modding activity many wad level files were made for them one reasons was clear separation between level files game engine itself half-life quake many other games have notable mapping tools communities focusing on user-generated content certain games such roguelike games levels may be procedurally generated these cases original game programmer controls how variations rooms tunnels are formed by tweaking randomly seeded algorithms process level editor warzone level design for each individual level modern game typically starts with concept art sketches renderings physical models once completed these concepts transform into extensive documentation environment modeling placing game specific entities actors usually with aid level editor level editor may be distributed complete stand-alone package at times rivaling commercial modelling software there are various steps involved laying out map these steps may vary dramatically across many different game genres that exist today general steps include laying out large-scale features map such hills cities rooms tunnels etc for players enemies move around determining environmental conditions ground rules such day/night weather scoring systems allowable weapons gameplay types time limits starting resources specifying certain regions where certain gameplay activities behaviors occur such resource harvesting base building water travelling etc specifying non-static parts level such doors keys buttons with associated mechanisms teleporters hidden passageways etc specifying locations various entities such player units enemies monster spawn points ladders coins resource nodes weapons save points etc specifying start exit locations for one more players adding aesthetic details such level-specific graphic textures sounds animation lighting music introducing scripted event locations where certain actions by player can trigger specified changes placing pathfinding nodes that non-player characters take they walk around actions they will take response specific triggers any dialog they might have with player first level game usually designed get players explore mechanics game notably world 1-1 super mario bros cut scenes may be triggered by events level but require distinctly different skills may be created by different person team level design process may be iterated several times before achieving desired outcome level designers and/or concept artists may also be required provide pre-rendered map level entire game world for player level bugs there are many map bugs that level designers try avoid but sometimes go unnoticed for some time player might get stuck map geometry with no way escape die player might be able find specific spot where they do not have move gain experience because monsters are constantly spawned but can be easily immediately killed multiplayer maps player may be able reach areas map designed be inaccessible for example reaching advantageous rooftop position camping other players worst case player might be able fall out-of-bounds map where other players cannot reach them invisible walls are cited be level design bugs might be left-over geometry from earlier version level object's improperly aligned collision box some cases specific mapping tools can be designed automatically detect problems such falling outside level reaching stuck areas careful level designers run these tools last step before releasing new version level most cases best way improve map by playtesting with experienced players allowing them try exploit any problems level designer level designer game designer who creates environments scenarios using level editor other tools level designers will usually work on level from pre-production completion working with both incomplete complete versions game game programmers usually produce level editors design tools for designers use this eliminates need for designers access modify game code opposed level editing tools sometimes available community level designers often work with placeholders prototypes aiming for level consistency clear layout before required artwork produced by game artists many level designers have skills both visual artist game designers although recent years responsibility for visual structural gameplay related tasks has been increasingly divided among several specialists notable level designers number individuals have made significant contributions field pc first person shooter levels these level designers include john romero responsible for great deal level design for doom richard levelord gray creator number levels for duke nukem sin design goals example map editor for battle for wesnoth level design necessary for two primary purposes - providing players with goal providing players with enjoyable play experience good level design strives produce quality gameplay provide immersive experience sometimes especially story-based games advance storyline skilled use textures audio necessary produce immersive player experience gameplay alteration maps' design can significantly impact gameplay for example gameplay may be shifted towards platformer by careful placement platforms puzzle game by extensive use buttons keys doors some fps maps may be designed prevent sniping by not including any long hallways while other maps may allow for mix sniping closer combat gimmick maps are sometimes created explore selected features gameplay such sniping fist fighting while they are briefly useful level designers interesting experienced players they are usually not included final list levels game because their limited replay value player directing levels are generally constructed with flow control mind that directing player towards goal level preventing confusion idling this can be accomplished by various means often level layouts features power-ups items aligned path combinations that collecting them inevitably progresses game advances story-line this one basic player direction technique most often seen platformers lighting illumination well distinctly coloured objects are often used unambiguously steer player towards correct path similarly clearly marked choke-points can be introduced another method strategic placement obstacles aesthetic environment props that direct player's attention clear paths instead this often used closed stuffed environments levels may be designed force players explore map advance most rts maps give each player starting base but will have resource distribution terrain features designed draw players out their base engage each other teamplay maps can provide noticeable advantages one team over another when designed poorly hidden features level designers sometimes create hidden rooms areas that usually require more effort for player reach notice these usually give some additional rewards such ammo powerups casual players usually do not discover these but these areas are interesting enough be discovered documented by dedicated gamers sometimes they serve easter eggs containing messages such level designers' names pictures political humorous messages one first games with engine feature hidden features was wolfenstein where certain walls could be pushed reveal hidden passages for example quake has many secret areas that reward player with ammo weapons quad damage powerups one hard-to-reach secret area dopefish makes appearance fact hardest difficulty level titled nightmare only reachable through secret portal fourth dimension's entrance hall sometimes whole level may be designed secret level tools wide variety tools may be used by someone designing level although faster design models textures with general purpose multimedia creation tools games usually require data be unique format suited for that game's engine for this specific compilers converters models textures audio data may be required lay out level some level editors for games include bethesda softworks's construction set valve corporation's hammer editor epic's unrealed udk bioware's aurora toolset id software's q3radiant unity grome outdoor editor chukong technologies's cocosstudio cocos creator using cocos2d-x multi engine multi game editors include id software's gtkradiant based on q3radiant open source quark some games may have built-in level editors like battlezone cube sauerbraten doom example console games with level editors are timesplitters developed by free radical design super mario maker developed by nintendo sometimes professional editing software such studio max blender autocad lightwave maya softimage xsi grome used usually customized with special plugin developed for specific game notes oxland pp21-22126 bates
