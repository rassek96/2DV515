confer ownership its license permission resell microsoft also stated that publishers could impose restrictions activation fees on second-hand copies games xbox chief marketing strategy officer yusuf mehdi explained that system was built with digital distribution mind but that microsoft wanted maintain availability games on physical media he also noted that microsoft was not giving publishers' objections used games but rather trying balance needs consumers industry that trading sharing abilities platform added level flexibility not seen on other online distribution platforms at time microsoft's e3 press conference on june was also criticized for focusing too much on games that beyond increased graphical capabilities provided experiences that were otherwise similar previous-generation games—giving little incentive for buying new console after sony's e3 press conference later that evening gamespot editor tom mcshea went on say that microsoft had become
