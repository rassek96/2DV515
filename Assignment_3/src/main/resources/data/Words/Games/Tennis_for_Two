tennis for two from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search tennis for two tennis for two on dumont lab oscilloscope type 304-a developers william higinbotham platforms analog computer release dates na october genres sports modes multiplayer tennis for two sports video game developed which simulates game tennis was one first games developed early history video games american physicist william higinbotham designed game for display at brookhaven national laboratory's annual public exhibition after learning that government research institution's donner model analog computer could simulate trajectories with wind resistance he designed game displayed on oscilloscope played with two custom aluminum controllers few hours after which he technician robert v dvorak built over three weeks game's visuals show representation tennis court viewed from side players adjust angle their shots with knob on their controller try hit ball over net by pressing button game was very popular during three-day exhibition with players lining up see game especially high school students was shown again following year with larger oscilloscope screen more complicated design that could simulate different gravity levels was then dismantled largely forgotten until late 1970s when higinbotham testified court about game during lawsuits between magnavox ralph h baer over video game patents since then has been celebrated one earliest video games brookhaven has made recreations original device under some definitions tennis for two considered first video game while did not include any technological innovations over prior games was first computer game be created purely entertainment product rather than for academic research commercial technology promotion contents development presentation legacy notes references external links development american physicist william higinbotham worked brookhaven national laboratory upton new york head instrumentation division higinbotham had bachelor's degree physics from williams college had previously worked technician physics department at cornell university while unsuccessfully pursuing phd there he served head electronics division manhattan project from began working at brookhaven which focused on researching peaceful uses atomic power once year government research facility held exhibition for public with one day each for high school students college students general public exhibition largely consisted tours static displays with some attempts at making displays with action so for exhibition higinbotham decided make interactive display entertain visitors while reading instruction manual for one brookhaven's computers donner model analog computer he learned that computer could calculate ballistic missile trajectories bouncing ball with wind resistance he decided use this ability form foundation game he later recalled his intentions were that might liven up place have game that people could play which could convey message that our scientific endeavors have relevance for society modern recreation controller higinbotham designed game that used oscilloscope display path simulated ball on tennis court viewed from side attached computer calculated path ball reversed its path when hit ground game also simulated ball hitting net if did not achieve high enough arc well changes velocity due drag from air resistance two aluminum controllers were attached computer each consisting button knob pressing button hit ball turning knob controlled angle shot originally higinbotham considered having second knob control velocity shot but decided would make controller too complicated device was designed few hours with help colleague dave potter was assembled over three weeks with help technician robert v dvorak while most circuitry was based on vacuum tubes relays circuits display graphics on oscilloscope used transistors then beginning replace vacuum tubes electronics industry excluding oscilloscope controller game's circuitry approximately took up space microwave oven presentation setup for tennis for two exhibited tennis for two was first shown on october game was rendered horizontal line representing tennis court short vertical line center representing tennis net first player would press button on their controller send ball point light over net would either hit net reach other side court fly out bounds second player could then hit ball back with their controller while was on their side either before after bounced on ground hundreds visitors lined up play new game during its debut higinbotham claimed later that high schoolers liked best you couldn't pull them away from due game's popularity upgraded version was shown following year with enhancements including larger screen different levels simulated gravity players could set game simulate gravity levels moon jupiter higinbotham referred game tennis for two though placard attached version titled computer tennis after exhibition game was dismantled so its components could be put other uses legacy after being dismantled tennis for two was largely forgotten remained virtually unknown until late 1970s early 1980s when higinbotham was called on testify court cases for defendants sued by magnavox over video game patents ralph h baer having discovered game lawyers for defense unsuccessfully attempted have game declared prior art invalidate baer's patents on television video games resulting attention being given nearly year old game possibly first video game received further attention subject articles creative computing video replay highlighting its possible status first video game editor creative computing david h ahl had played tennis for two at brookhaven dubbed higinbotham grandfather video games higinbotham himself felt that game was obvious extension donner model 30's bouncing ball program therefore not worthy patenting large part his legacy he preferred be remembered for his post-world war ii nuclear nonproliferation work recreation original tennis for two setup team at brookhaven recreated game for brookhaven's 50th anniversary reconstruction took about three months partially because parts were not readily available this recreation was also displayed at celebration 50th anniversary original game replica implemented analog computer using solid-state operational amplifier devices instead vacuum tubes original donner model did was replaced with restored donner model analog computer stony brook university founded william higinbotham game studies collection dedicated documenting material culture screen-based game media collecting preserving texts ephemera artifacts that document history work early game innovator brookhaven national laboratory scientist william higinbotham who invented first interactive analog computer game tennis for two tennis for two considered under some definitions be first video game other candidates with stronger candidacies from technological standpoint include cathode-ray tube amusement device earliest known interactive electronic game though did not run on computing device bertie brain earliest known game run on computer though used lightbulbs for display oxo draughts game by christopher strachey earliest digital computer games display visuals on electronic screen tennis for two though contained no technological developments separate from earlier games has distinction being earliest known computer game with visuals created purely for entertainment purposes prior games were created primarily for academic research purposes demonstrate computing power underlying machine with exception non-computer based cathode-ray tube amusement device this therefore makes tennis for two first video game under some definitions from philosophical viewpoint rather than technical one distinctive moment early history video games notes stony brook university's statement that tennis for two was first interactive analog computer game likely correct depending on definition game used but only due analog computer constraint several games including bertie brain oxo were previously developed for vacuum tube-based digital computers one prior game run on analog computer was hutspiel war simulation game by operations research office but goodyear electronic differential analyzer computer had no display unclear if computer ran game was only used run requested calculations references b c donovan tristan replay history video games yellow ant pp 1–9 isbn 978-0-9565072-0-4 b c d e f g h i j smith alexander tennis
