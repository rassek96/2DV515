game has been suggested that makeshift versions game were developed by british military officers india around 1860s 1870s who brought back with them row books stood up along center table net two more books served rackets were used continuously hit golf-ball had several different names including 'whiff-whaff' name ping-pong was wide use before british manufacturer j jaques & son ltd trademarked name ping-pong then came describe game played using rather expensive jaques's equipment with other manufacturers calling table tennis similar situation arose united states where jaques sold rights ping-pong name parker brothers parker brothers then enforced its trademark for term 1920s making various associations change their names table tennis instead more common but trademarked term next major innovation was by james w gibb british enthusiast table tennis who discovered novelty celluloid balls on trip us found them be ideal for game this was followed by ec goode who invented modern version racket by fixing sheet pimpled stippled rubber wooden blade table tennis was growing popularity by extent that tournaments were being organized books being written on subject unofficial world championship was held table tennis association was founded britain international table tennis federation ittf followed london hosted first official world championships united states table tennis association now called usa table tennis was formed 1930s edgar snow commented red star over china that communist forces chinese civil war had passion for english game table tennis which he found bizarre on other hand popularity sport waned 1930s soviet union partly because promotion team military sports partly because theory that game had adverse health effects 1950s paddles that used rubber sheet combined with underlying sponge layer changed game dramatically introducing greater spin speed these were introduced britain by sports goods manufacturer sw hancock ltd use speed glue increased spin speed even further resulting changes equipment slow game down table tennis was introduced olympic sport at olympics rule changes after olympics sydney ittf instituted several rule changes that were aimed at making table tennis more viable televised spectator sport first older mm balls were officially replaced by mm balls october this increased ball's air resistance effectively slowed down game by that time players had begun increasing thickness fast sponge layer on their paddles which made game excessively fast difficult watch on television few months later ittf changed from 21-point 11-point scoring system serve rotation was reduced from five points two effective september this was intended make games more fast-paced exciting ittf also changed rules on service prevent player from hiding ball during service order increase average length rallies reduce server's advantage effective for opponent have time realize serve taking place ball must be tossed minimum cm air ittf states that all events after july are played with new poly material ball equipment ball assortment mm table tennis balls international rules specify that game played with sphere having mass grams oz diameter millimetres rules say that ball shall bounce up 24–26 cm 94–102 when dropped from height cm onto standard steel block thereby having coefficient restitution ball made celluloid plastic colored white orange with matte finish choice ball color made according table color its surroundings for example white ball easier see on green blue table than on grey table manufacturers often indicate quality ball with star rating system usually from one three three being highest grade this system not standard across manufacturers only way ball may be used official competition upon ittf approval ittf approval can be seen printed on ball mm ball was introduced after summer olympics however this created some controversy at time chinese national team argued that this was merely give non-chinese players better chance winning since new type ball has slower speed mm table tennis ball slower spins less than original mm one at that time most chinese players were playing with fast attack smashes

paddle/racket main article table tennis racket players are equipped with laminated wooden racket covered with rubber on one two sides depending on grip player ittf uses term racket though bat common britain paddle us canada wooden portion racket often referred blade commonly features anywhere between one seven plies wood though cork glass fiber carbon fiber aluminum fiber kevlar are sometimes used according ittf regulations at least 85% blade by thickness shall be natural wood common wood types include balsa limba cypress hinoki which popular japan average size blade about centimetres long centimetres wide although official restrictions only focus on flatness rigidness blade itself these dimensions are optimal for most play styles table tennis regulations allow different surfaces on each side racket various types surfaces provide various levels spin speed some cases they nullify spin for example player may have rubber that provides much spin on one side their racket one that provides no spin on other by flipping racket play different types returns are possible help player distinguish between rubber used by his opposing player international rules specify that one side must be red while other side must be black player has right inspect his opponent's racket before match see type rubber used what colour despite high speed play rapid exchanges player can see clearly what side racket was used hit ball current rules state that unless damaged play racket cannot be exchanged for another racket at any time during match gameplay starting game according ittf rule first service decided by lot normally coin toss also common for one player umpire/scorer hide ball one other hand usually hidden under table allowing other player guess which hand ball correct incorrect guess gives winner option choose serve receive choose which side table use common but non-sanctioned method for players play ball back forth three times then play out point this commonly referred serve play rally serve play for serve volley for serve service return game play player serving ball commences play server first stands with ball held on open palm hand not carrying paddle called freehand tosses ball directly upward without spin at least cm high server strikes ball with racket on ball's descent so that touches first his court then touches directly receiver's court without touching net assembly casual games many players do not toss ball upward however this technically illegal can give serving player unfair advantage ball must remain behind endline above upper surface table known playing surface at all times during service server cannot use his/her body clothing obstruct sight ball opponent umpire must have clear view ball at all times if umpire doubtful legality service they may first interrupt play give warning server if serve clear failure doubted again by umpire after warning receiver scores point if service good then receiver must make good return by hitting ball back before bounces second time on receiver's side table so that ball passes net touches opponent's court either directly after touching net assembly thereafter server receiver must alternately make return until rally over returning serve one most difficult parts game server's first move often least predictable thus most advantageous shot due numerous spin speed choices at his her disposal let let rally which result not scored called following circumstances ball touches net service service provided service otherwise correct ball obstructed by player on receiving side obstruction means player touches ball when above traveling towards playing surface not having touched player's court since last being struck by player when player on receiving side not ready service delivered player's failure make service return comply with laws due disturbance outside control player play interrupted by umpire assistant umpire let also called foul service if ball hits server's side table if ball does not pass further than edge if ball hits table edge hits net scoring point scored by player for any several results rally opponent fails make correct service return after making service return ball touches anything other than net assembly before being struck by opponent ball passes over player's court beyond his end line without touching his court after being struck by opponent opponent obstructs ball opponent strikes ball twice successively note that hand that holding racket counts part racket that making good return off one's hand fingers allowed not fault if ball accidentally hits one's hand fingers then subsequently hits racket opponent strikes ball with side racket blade whose surface not covered with rubber opponent moves playing surface touches net assembly opponent's free hand touches playing surface receiver under expedite system completing returns rally opponent that has been warned by umpire commits second offense same individual match team match if third offence happens points will be given player if individual match team match has not ended any unused penalty points can be transferred next game that match game shall be won by player first scoring points unless both players score points when game shall be won by first player subsequently gaining lead points match shall consist best any odd number games competition play matches are typically best five seven games alternation services ends service alternates between opponents every two points regardless winner rally until end game unless both players score ten points expedite system operated when sequences serving receiving stay same but each player serves for only one point turn deuce player serving first game receives first next game match after each game players switch sides table last possible game match for example seventh game best seven matches players change ends when first player scores five points regardless whose turn serve service subject change on game point match upon possible last point match player with lesser score serves if sequence serving receiving out turn ends are not changed points scored wrong situation are still calculated game shall be resumed with order at score that has been reached doubles game service zone doubles game addition games between individual players pairs may also play table tennis singles doubles are both played international competition including olympic games since commonwealth games since ittf announced that doubles table tennis only was featured part team events olympics doubles all rules single play are applied except for following service line painted along long axis table create doubles courts bisects table this line's only purpose facilitate doubles service rule which that service must originate from right hand box such way that first bounce serve bounces once said right hand box then must bounce at least once opponent side's right hand box far left box for server receiving pair score point order play serving receiving players must hit ball turn for example if paired with b x paired with y server x receiver order play shall be a→x→b→y rally proceeds this way until one side fails make legal return other side scores at each change service previous receiver shall become server partner previous server shall become receiver for example if previous order play a→x→b→y order becomes x→b→y→a after change service second latter games match game begins reverse order play for example if order play a→x→b→y at beginning first game order begins with x→a→y→b y→b→x→a second game depending on either x y being chosen first server game that means first receiver game player who served first server game preceding game each game doubles match pair having right serve first shall choose which them will do so receiving pair however can only choose first game match when pair reaches points final game pairs must switch ends table change receiver reverse order play for example when last order play before pair score points final game a→x→b→y order after change shall be a→y→b→x if still has second serve otherwise x next server order becomes x→a→y→b expedite system if game unfinished after minutes' play fewer than points have been scored expedite system initiated umpire interrupts game game resumes with players serving for one point turn if expedite system introduced while ball not play previous receiver shall serve first under expedite system server must win point before opponent makes consecutive returns point goes opponent system can also be initiated at any time at request both players pairs once introduced expedite system remains force until end match rule shorten time match mainly seen defensive players' games grips though table tennis players grip their rackets various ways their grips can be classified into two major families styles penhold shakehand rules table tennis do not prescribe manner which one must grip racket numerous grips are employed penhold penhold grip so-named because one grips racket similarly way one holds writing instrument style play among penhold players can vary greatly from player player most popular style usually referred chinese penhold style involves curling middle ring fourth finger on back blade with three fingers always touching one another chinese penholders favour round racket head for more over-the-table style play contrast another style sometimes referred japanese/korean penhold grip involves splaying those three fingers out across back racket usually with all three fingers touching back racket rather than stacked upon one another sometimes combination two styles occurs wherein middle ring fourth fingers are straight but still stacked where all fingers may be touching back racket but are also contact with one another japanese/korean penholders will often use square-headed racket for away-from-the-table style play traditionally these square-headed rackets feature block cork on top handle well thin layer cork on back racket for increased grip comfort penhold styles are popular among players originating from east asian regions such china taiwan japan south korea traditionally penhold players use only one side racket hit ball during normal play side which contact with last three fingers generally not used this configuration sometimes referred traditional penhold more commonly found square-headed racket styles however chinese developed technique 1990s which penholder uses both sides racket hit ball where player produces backhand stroke most often topspin known reverse penhold backhand by turning traditional side racket face one's self striking ball with opposite side racket this stroke has greatly improved strengthened penhold style both physically psychologically eliminates strategic weakness traditional penhold backhand shakehand grip forehand backhand shakehand shakehand grip so-named because racket grasped if one performing handshake though sometimes referred tennis western grip bears no relation western tennis grip which was popularized on west coast united states which racket rotated 90° played with wrist turned so that on impact knuckles face target table tennis western refers western nations for this grip that players native europe americas have almost exclusively employed shakehand grip’s simplicity versatility coupled with acceptance among top-level chinese trainers that european style play should be emulated trained against has established common grip even china many world class european asian players currently use shakehand grip generally accepted that shakehands easier learn than penholder allowing broader range playing styles both offensive defensive seemiller seemiller grip named after american table tennis champion danny seemiller who used achieved by placing your thumb index finger on either side bottom racquet head holding handle with rest your fingers since only one side racquet used hit ball two contrasting rubber types can be applied blade offering advantage twiddling racket fool opponent seemiller paired inverted rubber with anti-spin rubber many players today combine inverted long-pipped rubber grip considered exceptional for blocking especially on backhand side for forehand loops backspin balls seemiller grip's popularity reached its apex when four danny seemiller ricky seemiller eric boggan brian masters united states' five participants world championships used shakehand grip vladimir samsonov chinese penhold ma lin traditional penhold ryu seung-min types strokes table tennis strokes generally break down into offensive defensive categories offensive strokes hit direct hit on ball propelling forward back opponent this stroke differs from speed drives other racket sports like tennis because racket primarily perpendicular direction stroke most energy applied ball results speed rather than spin creating shot that does not arc much but fast enough that can be difficult return speed drive used mostly for keeping ball play applying pressure on opponent potentially opening up opportunity for more powerful attack loop perfected during 1960s loop essentially reverse speed drive racket much more parallel direction stroke closed racket thus grazes ball resulting large amount topspin good loop drive will arc quite bit once striking opponent's side table will jump forward much like kick serve tennis counter-hit counter-hit usually counterattack against drives normally high loop drives racket held closed near ball which hit with short movement off bounce immediately after hitting table so that ball travels faster other side well-timed accurate counter-drive can be effective smash flip when player tries attack ball that has not bounced beyond edge table player does not have room wind up backswing ball may still be attacked however resulting shot called flip because backswing compressed into quick wrist action flip not single stroke can resemble either loop drive loop its characteristics what identifies stroke that backswing compressed into short wrist flick smash offensive trump card smash player will typically execute smash when his her opponent has returned ball that bounces too high too close net smashing consists using large backswing rapid acceleration impart much speed on ball possible goal smash get ball move so quickly that opponent simply cannot return because ball speed main aim this shot often spin on ball something other than topspin sidespin can be used effectively with smash alter ball's trajectory significantly although most intermediate players will smash ball with little no spin offensive table tennis player will think rally build-up winning smash defensive strokes push push slice asia usually used for keeping point alive creating offensive opportunities push resembles tennis slice racket cuts underneath ball imparting backspin causing ball float slowly other side table while not obvious push can be difficult attack because backspin on ball causes drop toward table upon striking opponent's racket order attack push player must usually loop ball back over net often best option for beginners simply push ball back again resulting pushing rallies against good players may be worst option because opponent will counter with loop putting first player defensive position another response pushing flipping ball when close net pushing can have advantages some circumstances such when opponent makes easy mistakes chop chop defensive backspin counterpart offensive loop drive chop essentially bigger heavier push taken well back from table racket face points primarily horizontally perhaps little bit upward direction stroke straight down object defensive chop match topspin opponent's shot with backspin good chop will float nearly horizontally back table some cases having so much backspin that ball actually rises such chop can be extremely difficult return due its enormous amount backspin some defensive players can also impart no-spin sidespin variations chop block block simple shot but nonetheless can be devastating against attacking opponent block executed by simply placing racket front ball right after ball bounces thus ball rebounds back toward opponent with nearly much energy came with this not easy sounds because ball's spin speed location all influence correct angle block very possible for opponent execute perfect loop drive smash only have blocked shot come back at him just fast due power involved offensive strokes often opponent simply cannot recover quickly enough will be unable return blocked shot blocks almost always produce same spin was received many times topspin depending on spin ball block may be returned unexpected side table this may come your advantage opponent may not expect this lob defensive lob possibly most impressive shot since propels ball about five metres height only land on opponent's side table with great amounts spin execute defensive player first backs-off table 4–6 meters then stroke itself consists lifting ball enormous height before falls back opponent's side table lob inherently creative shot can have nearly any kind spin top-quality players use this their advantage order control spin ball for instance though opponent may smash ball hard fast good defensive lob could be more difficult return due unpredictability heavy amounts spin on ball thus though backed off table by tens feet running reach ball good defensive player can still win point using good lobs however at professional level lobbers will lose point most time so lob not used unless really necessary effects spin adding spin onto ball causes major changes table tennis gameplay although nearly every stroke serve creates some kind spin understanding individual types spin allows players defend against use different spins effectively phases backspin curve backspin backspin where bottom half ball rotating away from player imparted by striking base ball with downward movement at professional level backspin usually used defensively order keep ball low backspin commonly employed service because harder produce offensive return though at professional level most people serve sidespin with either backspin topspin due initial lift ball there limit on how much speed with which one can hit ball without missing opponent's side table however backspin also makes harder for opponent return ball with great speed because required angular precision return alterations are frequently made regulations regarding equipment effort maintain balance between defensive offensive spin choices actually possible smash with backspin offensively but only on high balls that are close net phases topspin curve topspin topspin stroke has smaller influence on first part ball-curve like backspin stroke however axis spin remains roughly perpendicular trajectory ball thus allowing for magnus effect dictate subsequent curvature after apex curve ball dips downwards approaches opposing side before bouncing on bounce topspin will accelerate ball much same way that wheel which already spinning would accelerate upon making contact with ground again most significant change appears when opponent attempts return ball with smooth pimples inwards rubber due topspin ball jumps upwards opponent forced compensate for topspin by adjusting angle his her racket this commonly known closing racket speed limitation topspin stroke minor compared backspin stroke this stroke predominant technique used professional competition because gives opponent less time respond table tennis topspin regarded offensive technique due increased ball speed lower bio-mechanical efficiency pressure that puts on opponent by reducing reaction time possible play defensive topspin-lobs from far behind table but only highly skilled players use this stroke with any tactical efficiency topspin least common type spin be found service at professional level simply because much easier attack top-spin ball that not moving at high speed sidespin this type spin predominantly employed during service wherein contact angle racket can be more easily varied unlike two aforementioned techniques sidespin causes ball spin on axis which vertical rather than horizontal axis rotation still roughly perpendicular trajectory ball this circumstance magnus effect will still dictate curvature ball some degree another difference that unlike backspin topspin sidespin will have relatively very little effect on bounce ball much same way that spinning top would not travel left right if its axis rotation were exactly vertical this makes sidespin useful weapon service because less easily recognized when bouncing ball loses less spin on bounce sidespin can also be employed offensive rally strokes often from greater distance adjunct topspin backspin this stroke sometimes referred hook hook can even be used some extreme cases circumvent net when away from table corkspin this type spin almost exclusively employed service but also used from time time lob at professional level unlike any aforementioned techniques corkspin sometimes referred drill-spin features unique situation which axis spin more less parallel trajectory ball this means that magnus effect will have little no effect on trajectory cork-spun ball upon bouncing ball will dart right left depending on direction spin making very difficult return although theory this type spin produces most obnoxious effects not strategically practical sidespin backspin terms limitations that imposes upon opponent during their return aside from initial direction change when bouncing provided that does not exceed reach opponent cork-spun ball easily countered with topspin backspin similar backspin stroke corkspin stroke has lower maximum velocity simply due contact angle racket when producing stroke impart spin on ball which parallel its trajectory racket must be swung more less perpendicular trajectory ball this greatly limits amount forward momentum that can be transferred ball by racket corkspin almost always mixed with another variety spin less effective harder produce on its own competition competitive table tennis popular east asia
