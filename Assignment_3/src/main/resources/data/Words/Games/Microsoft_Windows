versions that shipped with early windows software from third parties made possible run their windows software on ms-dos without full windows feature set early versions windows are often thought graphical shells mostly because they ran on top ms-dos use for file system services however even earliest windows versions already assumed many typical operating system functions notably having their own executable file format providing their own device drivers timer graphics printer mouse keyboard sound unlike ms-dos windows allowed users execute multiple graphical applications at same time

features built from outset however windows nt its successors are designed for security including on network multi-user pcs but were not initially designed with internet security mind much since when was first developed early 1990s internet use was less prevalent these design issues combined with programming errors eg buffer overflows popularity windows means that frequent target computer worm virus writers june bruce schneier's counterpane internet security reported that had seen over new viruses worms previous six months kaspersky lab found around malicious programs—viruses trojans back-doors exploits written for windows microsoft releases security patches through its windows update service approximately once month usually second tuesday month although critical updates are made available at shorter intervals when necessary versions windows after including windows sp3 windows xp updates can be automatically downloaded installed if user selects do so result service pack for windows xp well service pack for windows server were installed by users more quickly than otherwise might have been while windows 9x series offered option having profiles for multiple users they had no concept access privileges did not allow concurrent access so were not true multi-user operating systems addition they implemented only partial memory protection they were accordingly widely criticised for lack security windows nt series operating systems by contrast are true multi-user implement absolute memory protection however lot advantages being true multi-user operating system were nullified by fact that prior windows vista first user account created during setup process was administrator account which was also default for new accounts though windows xp did have limited accounts majority home users did not change account type with fewer rights – partially due number programs which unnecessarily required administrator rights – so most home users ran administrator all time windows vista changes this by introducing privilege elevation system called user account control when logging standard user logon session created token containing only most basic privileges assigned this way new logon session incapable making changes that would affect entire system when logging user administrators group two separate tokens are assigned first token contains all privileges typically awarded administrator second restricted token similar what standard user would receive user applications including windows shell are then started with restricted token resulting reduced privilege environment even under administrator account when application requests higher privileges run administrator clicked uac will prompt for confirmation if consent given including administrator credentials if account requesting elevation not member administrators group start process using unrestricted token file permissions all windows versions from windows nt have been based on file system permission system referred aglp accounts global local permissions agdlp which essence where file permissions are applied file/folder form 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' members these global groups then hold other groups users depending on different windows versions used this system varies from other vendor products such linux netware due 'static' allocation permission being applied directory file folder however using this process aglp/agdlp/agudlp allows small number static permissions be applied allows for easy changes account groups without reapplying file permissions
