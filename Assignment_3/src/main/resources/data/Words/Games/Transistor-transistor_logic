breadboards transistor–transistor logic ttl class digital circuits built from bipolar junction transistors bjts resistors called transistor–transistor logic because transistors perform both logic function eg amplifying function compare with resistor–transistor logic rtl diode–transistor logic dtl ttl integrated circuits ics were widely used applications such computers industrial controls test equipment instrumentation consumer electronics synthesizers designation ttl sometimes used mean ttl-compatible logic levels even when not associated directly with ttl integrated circuits for example label on inputs outputs electronic instruments after their introduction integrated circuit form by sylvania ttl integrated circuits were manufactured by several semiconductor companies series also called 74xx by texas instruments became particularly popular ttl manufacturers offered wide range logic gate flip-flops counters other circuits several variations original ttl circuit design were developed variations offered interchangeable functions that had higher speed lower power dissipation allow design optimization ttl devices were originally made ceramic plastic dual-in-line dip packages flat-pack form ttl chips are now also made surface-mount packages ttl became foundation computers other digital electronics even after much larger scale integrated circuits made multiple-circuit-board processors obsolete ttl devices still found extensive use glue logic interfacing more densely integrated components contents history implementation o fundamental ttl gate o ttl with totem-pole output stage interfacing considerations packaging comparison with other logic families sub-types applications o analog applications see also references external links history real-time clock built ttl chips around ttl was invented by james l buie trw which declared particularly suited newly developing integrated circuit design technology original name for ttl was transistor-coupled transistor logic tctl first commercial integrated-circuit ttl devices were manufactured by sylvania called sylvania universal high-level logic family suhl sylvania parts were used controls phoenix missile ttl became popular with electronic systems designers after texas instruments introduced series ics with military temperature range later series specified over narrower range with inexpensive plastic packages texas instruments family became industry standard compatible parts were made by motorola amd fairchild intel intersil signetics mullard siemens sgs-thomson rifa national semiconductor many other companies even eastern bloc soviet union gdr poland czechoslovakia hungary romania - for details see series not only did others make compatible ttl parts but compatible parts were made using many other circuit technologies well at least one manufacturer ibm produced non-compatible ttl circuits for its own use ibm used technology ibm system/38 ibm ibm term ttl applied many successive generations bipolar logic with gradual improvements speed power consumption over about two decades most recently introduced family 74fxx still sold today was widely used into late 90s 74as/als advanced schottky was introduced texas instruments continues supply more general-purpose chips numerous obsolete technology families albeit at increased prices typically ttl chips integrate no more than few hundred transistors each functions within single package generally range from few logic gates microprocessor bit-slice ttl also became important because its low cost made digital techniques economically practical for tasks previously done by analog methods kenbak-1 ancestor first personal computers used ttl for its cpu instead microprocessor chip which was not available datapoint from used ttl components for its cpu was basis for later x86 instruction set xerox alto star workstations which introduced graphical user interface used ttl circuits integrated at level arithmetic logic units alus bitslices respectively most computers used ttl-compatible glue logic between larger chips well into 1990s until advent programmable logic discrete bipolar logic was used prototype emulate microarchitectures under development implementation fundamental ttl gate two-input ttl nand gate with simple output stage simplified ttl inputs are emitters multiple-emitter transistor this ic structure functionally equivalent multiple transistors where bases collectors are tied together output buffered by common emitter amplifier inputs both logical ones when all inputs are held at high voltage base–emitter junctions multiple-emitter transistor are reverse-biased unlike dtl small “collector” current approximately 10µa drawn by each inputs this because transistor reverse-active mode approximately constant current flows from positive rail through resistor into base multiple emitter transistor this current passes through base-emitter junction output transistor allowing conduct pulling output voltage low logical zero input logical zero note that base-collector junction multiple-emitter transistor base-emitter junction output transistor are series between bottom resistor ground if one input voltage becomes zero corresponding base-emitter junction multiple-emitter transistor parallel with these two junctions phenomenon called current steering means that when two voltage-stable elements with different threshold voltages are connected parallel current flows through path with smaller threshold voltage that current flows out this input into zero low voltage source result no current flows through base output transistor causing stop conducting output voltage becomes high logical one during transition input transistor briefly its active region so draws large current away from base output transistor thus quickly discharges its base this critical advantage ttl over dtl that speeds up transition over diode input structure main disadvantage ttl with simple output stage relatively high output resistance at output logical that completely determined by output collector resistor limits number inputs that can be connected fanout some advantage simple output stage high voltage level up vcc output logical when output not loaded common variation omits collector resistor output transistor making open collector output this allows designer fabricate logic by connecting open collector outputs several logic gates together providing single external pull-up resistor if any logic gates becomes logic low transistor conducting combined output will be low examples this type gate are series open collector outputs some gates have higher maximum voltage such 15v for useful when driving other than ttl loads ttl with totem-pole output stage standard ttl nand with totem-pole output stage one four solve problem with high output resistance simple output stage second schematic adds this totem-pole push–pull output consists two n-p-n transistors v3 v4 lifting diode v5 current-limiting resistor r3 see figure on right driven by applying same current steering idea above when v2 off v4 off well v3 operates active region voltage follower producing high output voltage logical when v2 on activates v4 driving low voltage logical output v2 v4 collector–emitter junctions connect v4 base–emitter junction parallel series-connected v3 base–emitter v5 anode–cathode junctions v3 base current deprived transistor turns off does not impact on output middle transition resistor r3 limits current flowing directly through series connected transistor v3 diode v5 transistor v4 that are all conducting also limits output current case output logical short connection ground strength gate may be increased without proportionally affecting power consumption by removing pull-up pull-down resistors from output stage main advantage ttl with totem-pole output stage low output resistance at output logical determined by upper output transistor v3 operating active region emitter follower resistor r3 does not increase output resistance since connected v3 collector its influence compensated by negative feedback disadvantage totem-pole output stage decreased voltage level no more than v output logical even if output unloaded reason this reduction are voltage drops across v3 base–emitter v5 anode–cathode junctions interfacing considerations like dtl ttl current-sinking logic since current must be drawn from inputs bring them logic level at low input voltage ttl input sources current which must be absorbed by previous stage maximum value this input current about ma for standard ttl gate input source has be low-resistive enough crc press isbn 0-8493-1998-6 us buie james l coupling transistor logic other circuits issued assigned trw
