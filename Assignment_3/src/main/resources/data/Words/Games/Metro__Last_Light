related his next book metro instead serves direct sequel first game with majority ideas created by 4a games according huw beynon head communications for thq team chose not make video game adaption they thought 2034's tone was drastically different from its predecessor he described art-house thriller believed that unlike first game could not be converted successfully into video game however glukhovsky offered creative input project wrote brief outline game's story well game's dialogue which used spreadsheet cells excel team chose bad ending they believed that offered interesting beginning for last light consistent with novel's dark depressing tone glukhovsky claimed that story would explore theme redemption people repeating their mistakes idea having second chance artyom character also shifted become more mature experienced however he remained silent character team thought that having him speak would not contribute his character development would interfere with atmosphere morality system one key goals 4a games was improve refine numerous aspects which thq described flawed masterpiece strong focus on atmosphere was retained but team overhauled numerous gameplay mechanics game's shooting mechanics were improved firearms featured game were no longer underpowered animation system was reworked more visual effects were added game's artificial intelligence was also refined become more responsive players' actions after hearing from players about 2033's bullet-based economic system team decided keep feature last light but improve explanation about how worked so that players would not be confused by addition team revealed that they would not westernize franchise attract larger audience instead they would overhaul game's controls make more accessible team also drastically improved game's stealth sections core philosophy designing these sections was fun players would not be punished too harshly if they made any mistakes such making too much noise result alertness artificial intelligence features several different levels making game more realistic competitive multiplayer mode was originally planned that was said be unique metro series would not simply include typical multiplayer modes like team deathmatch capture flag however was eventually cancelled but possibility having multiplayer mode remained could be developed after

let studio continue deliver their vision ambitions for game — 4a games communications lead huw beynon another team's goals was make players feel unsettled after playing game present gameplay moments that would make them worry feel vulnerable team incorporated survival horror elements into game which were also used first game game was described by thq their own bid combat shooter fatigue using its heavy single-player story focus according beynon game's philosophy complete opposite call duty franchise which was described short linear filled with filler content that would only be tutorial for multiplayer content team hoped have most moments featured game narrative-driven that all enemy encounters game are designed be different from each other they hoped that by offering unique experience with each encounter they would be remembered by players they hoped that game would rekindle memories half-life world created be believable glukhovsky included numerous side stories game different kinds dramas surrounding game's four factions he hoped that through this approach game would have more depth than typical first-person shooters make game feel genuinely realistic moral choices return game according 4a these choices are very subtle so that they would not gamify concept method carried out by 4a create sense verisimilitude world which will then make decision more genuine achieve naturalism andrey prokhorov game's creative director intentionally removed most aspects typical head up display they considered barrier preventing players from immersing themselves into world that having would destroy game's atmosphere prokhorov noted that adding numerous graphical audio cues required additional time effort but he claimed that should they have sufficient time team may not make
