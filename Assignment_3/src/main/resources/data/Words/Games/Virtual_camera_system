their purpose show action at best possible angle more generally they are used virtual worlds when third person view required opposed film makers virtual camera system creators have deal with world that interactive unpredictable not possible know where player's character going be next few seconds therefore not possible plan shots film maker would do solve this issue system relies on certain rules artificial intelligence select most appropriate shots there are mainly three types camera systems fixed camera systems camera does not move at all system displays player's character succession still shots tracking cameras on other hand follow character's movements finally interactive camera systems are partially automated allow player directly change view implement camera systems video game developers use techniques such constraint solvers artificial intelligence scripts autonomous agents contents third-person view o fixed o tracking o interactive implementation mixed-reality applications real-time recording motion tracking see also references third-person view video games third-person refers graphical perspective rendered from fixed distance behind slightly above player character this viewpoint allows players see more strongly characterized avatar most common action games action adventure games games with this perspective often make use positional audio where volume ambient sounds varies depending on position avatar there are primarily three types third-person camera systems fixed camera systems which camera positions are set during game creation tracking camera systems which camera simply follows player's character interactive camera systems that are under player's control fixed selection shots resident evil that aim at creating tension this kind system developers set properties camera such its position orientation field view during game creation camera views will not change dynamically so same place will always be shown under same set views early example this kind camera system can be seen alone dark while characters are background on which they evolve has been pre-rendered early resident evil games are notable examples games that use fixed cameras god war series video games also known for this technique one advantage this camera system that allows game designers use language film indeed like filmmakers they have possibility create mood through camerawork careful selection shots games that use this kind technique are often praised for their cinematic qualities tracking illustration protagonist whom player controls tracking camera just behind slightly above slightly facing down towards that character name says tracking camera follows characters from behind player does not control camera any way - he/she cannot for example rotate move different position this type camera system was very common early games such crash bandicoot tomb raider since very simple implement however there are number issues with particular if current view not suitable either because occluded by object because not showing what player interested cannot be changed since player does not control camera sometimes this viewpoint causes difficulty when character turns stands face out against wall camera may jerk end up awkward positions interactive instead staying behind mario camera intelligently rotates show path super mario this type camera system improvement over tracking camera system while camera still tracking character some its parameters such its orientation distance character can be changed on videogame consoles camera often controlled by analog stick provide good accuracy whereas on pc games usually controlled by mouse this case games such super mario sunshine legend zelda wind waker fully interactive camera systems are often difficult implement right way thus gamespot argues that much super mario sunshine' difficulty comes from having control camera legend zelda wind waker was more successful at - ign called camera system so smart that rarely needs manual correction one first games offer interactive camera system was super mario game had two types camera systems between which player could switch at any time first one was standard tracking camera system except that was partly driven by artificial intelligence indeed system was aware structure level therefore could anticipate certain shots for example first level when path hill about turn left camera automatically starts looking towards left too thus anticipating player's movements second type allows player control camera relatively mario's position by pressing on left right buttons camera rotates around mario while pressing up down moves camera closer away from mario implementation there large body research on how implement camera system role constraint solver software generate best possible shot given set visual constraints other words constraint solver given requested shot composition such show this character ensure that he covers at least percent screen space solver will then use various methods try creating shot that would satisfy this request once suitable shot found solver outputs coordinates rotation camera which can then be used by graphic engine renderer display view some camera systems if no solution can be found constraints are relaxed for example if solver cannot generate shot where character occupies percent screen space might ignore screen space constraint simply ensure that character visible at all such methods include zooming out some camera systems use predefined scripts decide how select current shot for commonly seen shot scenarios called film idioms typically script going be triggered result action for instance when player's character initiates conversation with another character conversation script going be triggered this script will contain instructions on how shoot two-character conversation thus shots will be combination for instance over shoulder shots close-up shots such script-based approaches may switch camera between set predefined cameras rely on constraint solver generate camera coordinates account for variability scene layout this scripted approach use constraint solver compute virtual cameras was first proposed by drucker subsequent research demonstrated how script-based system could automatically switch cameras view conversations between avatars realtime chat application bill tomlinson used more original approach problem he devised system which camera autonomous agent with its own personality style shots their rhythm will be affected by its mood thus happy camera will cut more frequently spend more time close-up shots move with bouncy swooping motion brightly illuminate scene while much prior work automated virtual camera control systems has been directed towards reducing need for human manually control camera director's lens solution computes proposes palette suggested virtual camera shots leaving human operator make creative shot selection computing subsequent suggested virtual camera shots system analyzes visual compositions editing patterns prior recorded shots compute suggested camera shots that conform continuity conventions such not crossing line action match placement virtual characters so they appear look at one another across cuts favors those shots which human operator had previously used sequence mixed-reality applications kinect was released by microsoft scanner/webcam hybrid peripheral device which provides full-body detection xbox players hands-free control user interfaces video games other software on console this was later modified by oliver kreylos university california davis series youtube videos which showed him combining kinect with pc-based virtual camera because kinect capable detecting full range depth through computer stereo vision structured light within captured scene kreylos demonstrated capacity kinect virtual camera allow free-viewpoint navigation range depth although camera could only allow video capture scene shown front kinect resulting fields black empty space where camera was unable capture video within field depth later kreylos demonstrated further elaboration on modification by combining video streams two kinects order further enhance video capture within view virtual camera kreylos' developments using kinect were covered among works others kinect hacking homebrew community new york times article real-time recording motion tracking virtual cameras have been developed which allow director film motion capture view digital characters
