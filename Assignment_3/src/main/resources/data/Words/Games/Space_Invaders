sources including adaptation mechanical game space monsters released by taito dream about japanese school children who are waiting for santa claus are attacked by invading aliens however nishikado has cited atari's arcade game breakout his inspiration he aimed create shooting game that featured same sense achievement from completing stages destroying targets but with more complex graphics nishikado used similar layout that breakout but altered game mechanics rather than bounce ball attack static objects players are given ability fire projectiles at their own discretion attack moving enemies early enemy designs included tanks combat planes battleships nishikado however was not satisfied with enemy movements technical limitations made difficult simulate flying humans would have been easier simulate but nishikado considered shooting them immoral after seeing magazine feature about star wars he thought using space theme nishikado drew inspiration for aliens from h g wells' war worlds—he

alien-inspired hit featured continuous music—the well-known four-note loop—throughout uninterrupted by sound effects was thus first time that sound effects music were superimposed form rich sonic landscape not only do players receive feedback related directly their actions through sound effects they also receive stimulus more subtle non-interactive fashion through music music interacts with on-screen animation influence emotions player that seemingly pedestrian four-note loop might stir us most primitive ways but that stirs us at all worthy note by demonstrating that game sound could be more than simple tune fill silence space invaders moved video game music closer realm art music popularized notion variability—the idea that music can change accordance with ongoing narrative variable space invaders tempo admittedly simple but its implications are not be underestimated over years analogous strategies variation would be applied pitch rhythm dynamics form host other parameters all
