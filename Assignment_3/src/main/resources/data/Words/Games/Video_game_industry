industry juggernaut development profit still drives technological advancement which then used by other industry sectors technologies such virtual reality augmented reality are major drivers for game hardware gameplay development though not main driving force indie games continue have significant impact on industry with sales some these titles such spelunky fez don't starve castle crashers minecraft exceeding millions dollars over million users 2010s have seen larger shift casual mobile gaming mobile gaming market estimated have taken $38 billion revenues compared $6 billion for console market $33 billion for personal computing gaming newer game companies arose that vertically integrate live operations publishing such crowdfunding other direct-to-consumer efforts rather than relying on traditional publishers some these have grown substantial size economics early on development costs were minimal video games could be quite profitable games developed by single programmer by small team programmers artists could sell hundreds thousands copies each many these games only took few months create so developers could release multiple titles per year thus publishers could often be generous with benefits such royalties on games sold many early game publishers started from this economic climate such origin systems sierra entertainment capcom activision electronic arts computing graphics power increased so too did size development teams larger staffs were needed address ever-increasing technical design complexities larger teams consist programmers artists game designers producers their salaries can range anywhere from $50000 $120000 generating large labor costs for firms producing videogames which can often take between one three years develop now budgets typically reach millions dollars despite growing popularity middleware pre-built game engines addition growing development costs marketing budgets have grown dramatically sometimes consisting two three times

high-budget high-quality titles under development richard hilleman electronic arts estimated that only developers were working on such titles for eighth console generation compared at same point seventh generation-console cycle seven eight years earlier practices video game industry practices are similar those other entertainment industries eg music recording industry but video game industry particular has been accused treating its development talent poorly this promotes independent development developers leave form new companies projects some notable cases these new companies grow large impersonal having adopted business practices their forebears ultimately perpetuate cycle however unlike music industry where modern technology has allowed fully professional product be created extremely inexpensively by independent musician modern games require increasing amounts manpower equipment this dynamic makes publishers who fund developers much more important than music industry breakaways video game industry common for developers leave their current studio start their own particularly famous case original independent developer activision founded by former atari developers activision grew become world's second largest game publisher mean time many original developers left work on other projects for example founder alan miller left activision start another video game development company accolade now atari née infogrames activision was popular among developers for giving them credit packaging title screens for their games while atari disallowed this practice video game industry took off mid-1980s many developers faced more distressing problem working with fly-by-night unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly run off with game profits piracy industry claims software piracy be big problem take measures counter this however digital rights management other measures have proved noticeably unpopular with gamers creative control on various internet forums some gamers have expressed disapproval publishers having creative control since publishers are more apt follow short-term market trends rather than invest risky but potentially lucrative ideas on other hand publishers may know better than developers what consumers want relationship between video game developers publishers parallels relationship between recording artists record labels many ways but unlike music industry which has seen flat declining sales early 2000s video game industry continues grow also personal computers have made independent development music almost effortless while gap between independent game developer product fully financed one grows larger computer games industry easier create startup resulting many successful companies console games industry more closed one game developer must have up three licenses from console manufacturer license develop games for console publisher must have license publish games for console separate license for each game addition developer must usually buy development systems from console manufacturer order even develop game for consideration well obtain concept approval for game from console manufacturer therefore developer normally has have publishing deal place before starting development on game project but order secure publishing deal developer must have track record console
