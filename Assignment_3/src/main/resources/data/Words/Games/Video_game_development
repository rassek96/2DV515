business traditional commercial pc console are normally funded by publisher take several years develop indie games can take less time can be produced cheaply by individuals small developers indie game industry has seen rise recent years with growth new online distribution systems mobile game market first video games were developed 1960s but required mainframe computers were not available general public commercial game development began 1970s with advent first generation video game consoles home computers due low costs low capabilities computers lone programmer could develop full game however approaching 21st century ever-increasing computer processing power heightened consumer expectations made difficult for single developer produce mainstream console pc game average cost producing video game slowly rose from us$1–4 million over $5 million then over $20 million by mainstream pc console games are generally developed phases first pre-production pitches prototypes game design documents

developed creative outlet generate profit development normally funded by publisher well-made games bring profit more readily however important estimate game's financial requirements such development costs individual features failing provide clear implications game's expectations may result exceeding allocated budget fact majority commercial games do not produce profit most developers cannot afford changing development schedule require estimating their capabilities with available resources before production game industry requires innovations publishers cannot profit from constant release repetitive sequels imitations every year new independent development companies open some manage develop hit titles similarly many developers close down because they cannot find publishing contract their production not profitable difficult start new company due high initial investment required nevertheless growth casual mobile game market has allowed developers with smaller teams enter market once companies become financially stable they may expand develop larger games most developers start small gradually expand their business developer receiving profit from successful title may store up capital expand re-factor their company well tolerate more failed deadlines average development budget for multiplatform game us$18-28m with high-profile games often exceeding $40m early era home computers video game consoles early 1980s single programmer could handle almost all tasks developing game — programming graphical design sound effects etc could take little six weeks develop game however high user expectations requirements modern commercial games far exceed capabilities single developer require splitting responsibilities team over hundred people can be employed full-time for single project game development production design process that starts from idea concept often idea based on modification existing game concept game idea may fall within one several genres designers often experiment with different combinations genres game designer usually produces initial game proposal document that contains concept gameplay feature list setting story target audience requirements schedule staff budget estimates different companies have different formal procedures philosophies regarding game design development there no standardized development method however commonalities exist game development undertaken by game developer—ranging from individual large company there can be independent publisher-owned studios independent developers rely on financial support from game publisher they usually have develop game from concept prototype without external funding formal game proposal then submitted publishers who may finance game development from several months years publisher would retain exclusive rights distribute market game would often own intellectual property rights for game franchise publisher's company may also own developer's company may have internal development studios generally publisher one who owns game's intellectual property rights all but smallest developer companies work on several titles at once this necessary because time taken between shipping game receiving royalty payments which may be between months small companies may structure contracts ask for advances on royalties use shareware distribution employ part-time workers use other methods meet payroll demands console manufacturers such microsoft nintendo sony have standard set technical requirements that game must conform order be approved additionally game concept must be approved by manufacturer who may refuse approve certain titles most modern pc console games take from one three years complete where mobile game can be developed few months length development influenced by number factors such genre scale development platform amount assets some games can take much longer than average time frame complete infamous example realms' duke nukem forever announced be production april released fourteen years later june planning for maxis' game spore began late game was released nine years later september game prey was briefly profiled issue pc gamer but was not released until only then highly altered form finally team fortress was development from until its release emerged from convoluted development process involving probably three four different games according gabe newell game revenue from retails divided among parties along distribution chain such — developer publisher retail manufacturer console royalty many developers fail profit from this go bankrupt many developers seek alternative economic models through internet marketing distribution channels improve returns through mobile distribution channel share developer can be up 70% total revenue through online distribution channel almost 100% history further information history game development xgs pic 16-bit game development board game development tool similar those used 1990s history game making begins with development first video games although which video game first depends on definition video game first games created had little entertainment value their development focus was separate from user experience—in fact these games required mainframe computers play them oxo written by alexander s douglas was first computer game use digital display game called tennis for two which displayed its output on oscilloscope was made by willy higinbotham physicist working at brookhaven national laboratory mainframe computer game called spacewar was developed by group massachusetts institute technology students led by steve russell true commercial design development games began 1970s when arcade video games first-generation consoles were marketed computer space was first commercially sold coin-operated video game used black-and-white television for its display computer system was made series ttl chips first home console system was released called magnavox odyssey developed by ralph h baer that same year atari released pong arcade game that increased video game popularity commercial success pong led other companies develop pong clones spawning video game industry programmers worked within big companies produce games for these devices industry did not see huge innovation game design large number consoles had very similar games many these early games were often pong clones some games were different however such gun fight which was significant for several reasons early on-foot multi-directional shooter which depicted game characters game violence human-to-human combat tomohiro nishikado's original version was based on discrete logic which dave nutting adapted using intel making first video game use microprocessor console manufacturers soon started produce consoles that were able play independently developed games ran on microprocessors marking beginning second-generation consoles beginning with release fairchild channel f flood pong clones led video game crash which eventually came end with mainstream success taito's arcade shooter game space invaders marking beginning golden age arcade video games inspiring dozens manufacturers enter market its creator nishikado not only designed programmed game but also did artwork engineered arcade hardware put together microcomputer from scratch was soon ported atari becoming first killer app quadrupling console's sales at same time home computers appeared on market allowing individual programmers hobbyists develop games this allowed hardware manufacturer software manufacturers act separately very large amount games could be produced by single individuals games were easy make because graphical memory limitation did not allow for much content larger companies developed who focused selected teams work on title developers many early home video games such zork baseball air warrior adventure later transitioned their work products early video game industry “ i wouldn't recommend for someone with weak heart large appetite ” — jon freeman industry expanded significantly at time with arcade video game sector alone representing largest share gaming industry generating higher revenues than both pop music hollywood films combined home video game industry however suffered major losses following north american video game crash jon freeman warned computer gaming world q are computer games way fame fortune no not unless your idea fame having your name recognized by one two astute individuals at origins i've been making living after fashion designing games for most last six years i wouldn't recommend for someone with weak heart large appetite though chris crawford don daglow similarly advised prospective designers write games hobby first not quit their existing jobs early home video game industry was revitalized soon after by widespread success nintendo entertainment system by video game required months develop another six plan marketing projects remained usually solo efforts with single developers delivering finished games their publishers with ever-increasing processing graphical capabilities arcade console computer products along with increase user expectations game design moved beyond scope single developer produce marketable game reasonable time this sparked beginning team-based development broad terms during 1980s pre-production involved sketches test routines only developer 1990s pre-production consisted mostly game art previews early 2000s pre-production usually produced playable demo month development project was funded by publisher for us$1m–3m additionally $250k–15m were spent on marketing sales development over games were released for pc from about games turning profit only about made significant profit early 2000s became increasingly common use middleware game engines such quake engine unreal engine early 2000s also mobile games started gain popularity however mobile games distributed by mobile operators remained marginal form gaming until apple app store was launched mainstream console video game cost from us$3m $6m develop some games cost much $20m develop profit from console game sold at retail was divided among parties distribution chain follows developer 13% publisher 32% retail 32% manufacturer 5% console royalty 18% developer would retain around 17% retail price around 85% if sold online since third generation consoles home video game industry has constantly increased expanded industry revenue has increased at least five-fold since 1990s software portion video game revenue was $95 billion exceeding that movie industry apple app store introduced was first mobile application store operated directly by mobile platform holder significantly changed consumer behaviour more favourable for downloading mobile content quickly broadened markets mobile games games market annual value was estimated between $7–30 billion depending on which sales figures are included this on par with films box office market publisher would typically fund independent developer for $500k–$5m for development title total value had already reached $663 billion by then video game markets were not anymore dominated by console games according newzoo share mmo's was 198% pc/mac's 98% tablets' 32% smartphones 106% handhelds' 98% consoles' only 367% online casual games 102% fastest growing market segments being mobile games with average annual rate 19% for smartphones 48% for tablets past several years many developers opened many closed down each year number developers are acquired by larger companies merge with existing companies for example blizzard entertainment's parent company vivendi games merged with activision electronic arts nearly acquired take-two interactive midway games was acquired by time-warner eidos interactive merged with square enix roles q what lessons had you learned from these ventures which you could share for benefits fans

director publisher main article video game publisher ] this section needs expansion you can help by adding april video game publisher company that publishes video games that they have either developed internally have had developed by external video game developer with book publishers publishers dvd movies video game publishers are responsible for their product's manufacturing marketing including market research all aspects advertising they usually finance development sometimes by paying video game developer publisher calls this external development sometimes by paying internal staff developers called studio consequently they also typically own ip game large video game publishers also distribute games they publish while some smaller publishers instead hire distribution companies larger video game publishers distribute games they publish other functions usually performed by publisher include deciding on paying for any license that game may utilize paying for localization layout printing possibly writing user manual creation graphic design elements such box design large publishers may also attempt boost efficiency across all internal external development teams by providing services such sound design code packages for commonly needed functionality because publisher usually finances development usually tries manage development risk with staff producers project managers monitor progress developer critique ongoing development assist necessary most video games created by external video game developer are paid for with periodic advances on royalties these advances are paid when developer reaches certain stages development called milestones independent video game developers create games without publisher may choose digitally distribute their games development team developers can range size from small groups making casual games housing hundreds employees producing several large titles companies divide their subtasks game's development individual job titles may vary however roles are same within industry development team consists several members some members team may handle more than one role similarly more than one task may be handled by same member team size can vary from more members depending on game's scope most represented are artists followed by programmers then designers finally audio specialists with two three producers management these positions are employed full-time other positions such testers may be employed only part-time salaries for these positions vary depending on both experience location employee entry-level programmer can make on average around $70000 annually experienced programmer can make on average around $125000 annually development team includes these roles disciplines designer further information video game design game designer person who designs gameplay conceiving designing rules structure game development teams usually have lead designer who coordinates work other designers they are main visionary game one roles designer being writer often employed part-time conceive game's narrative dialogue commentary cutscene narrative journals video game packaging content hint system etc larger projects there are often separate designers for various parts game such game mechanics user interface characters dialogue etc artist further information game art design game artist visual artist who

job may be oriented oriented artists may produce concept art sprites textures environmental backdrops terrain images user interface artists may produce models meshes animation environment cinematics artists sometimes occupy both roles programmer main article game programmer game programmer software engineer who primarily develops video games related software such game development tools game's codebase development handled by programmers there are usually one several lead programmers who implement game's starting codebase overview future development programmer allocation on individual modules individual programming disciplines roles include physics – programming game engine including simulating physics collision object movement etc ai – producing computer agents using game ai techniques such scripting planning rule-based decisions etc graphics – managing graphical content utilization memory considerations production graphics engine integration models textures work along physics engine sound – integration music speech effect sounds into proper locations times gameplay – implementation various games rules features sometimes called generalist scripting – development maintenance high-level command system for various in-game tasks such ai level editor triggers etc ui – production user interface elements like option menus huds help feedback systems etc input processing – processing compatibility correlation various input devices such keyboard mouse gamepad etc network communications – managing data inputs outputs for local internet gameplay game tools – production tools accompany development game especially for designers scripters level designer further information level design level designer person who creates levels challenges missions for computer and/or video games using specific set programs these programs may be commonly available commercial design programs specially designed tailored level editors made for specific game level designers work with both incomplete complete versions game game programmers usually produce level editors design tools for designers use this eliminates need for designers access modify game code level editors may involve custom high-level scripting languages for interactive environments ais opposed level editing tools sometimes available community level designers often work with placeholders prototypes aiming for consistency clear layout before required artwork completed sound engineer sound engineers are technical professionals responsible for sound effects sound positioning they sometimes oversee voice acting other sound asset creation composers who create game's musical score also comprise game's sound team though often this work outsourced tester further information game testing quality assurance carried out by game testers game tester analyzes video games document software defects part quality control testing highly technical field requiring computing expertise analytic competence testers ensure that game falls within proposed design both works entertainingthis involves testing all features compatibility localization etc although necessary throughout whole development process testing expensive often actively utilized only towards completion project development process game development software development process video game software with art audio gameplay formal software development methods are often overlooked games with poor development methodology are likely run over budget time estimates well contain large number bugs planning important for individual group projects alike overall game development not suited for typical software life cycle methods such waterfall model one method employed for game development agile development based on iterative prototyping subset software prototyping agile development depends on feedback refinement game's iterations with gradually increasing feature set this method effective because most projects do not start with clear requirement outline popular method agile software development scrum another successful method personal software process psp requiring additional training for staff increase awareness project's planning this method more expensive requires commitment team members psp can be extended team software process where whole team self-directing game development usually involves overlap these methods for example asset creation may be done via waterfall model because requirements specification are clear but gameplay design might be done using iterative prototyping development commercial game usually includes following stages pre-production pre-production design phase planning phase project focused on idea concept development production initial design documents goal concept development produce clear easy understand documentation which describes all tasks schedules estimates for development team suite documents produced this phase called production plan this phase usually not funded by publisher however good publishers may require developers produce plans during pre-production concept documentation can be separated into three stages documents—high concept pitch concept however there no industry standard naming convention for example both bethke bates refer pitch document game proposal yet moore novak refers concept document game proposal late stage pre-production may also be referred proof concept technical review when more detailed game documents are produced publishers have started expect broader game proposals even featuring playable prototypes high concept high concept brief description game pitch pitch concept document proposal document game proposal short summary document intended present game's selling points detail why game would be profitable develop verbal pitches may be made management within developer company then presented publishers written document may need be shown publishers before funding approved game proposal may undergo one several green-light meetings with publisher executives who determine if game be developed presentation project often given by game designers demos may be created for pitch however may be unnecessary for established developers with good track records if developer acts its own publisher both companies are subsidiaries single company then only upper management needs give approval concept concept document game proposal game plan more detailed document than pitch document this includes all information produced about game this includes high concept game's genre gameplay description features setting story target audience hardware platforms estimated schedule marketing analysis team requirements risk analysis before approved design completed skeleton crew programmers artists usually begins work programmers may develop quick-and-dirty prototypes showcasing one more features that stakeholders would like see incorporated final product artists may develop concept art asset sketches springboard for developing real game assets producers may work part-time on game at this point scaling up for full-time commitment development progresses game producers work during pre-production related planning schedule budget estimating tasks with team producer aims create solid production plan so that no delays are experienced at start production game design document main article game design document before full-scale production can begin development team produces first version game design document incorporating all most material from initial pitch design document describes game's concept major gameplay elements detail may also include preliminary sketches various aspects game design document sometimes accompanied by functional prototypes some sections game design document remains living document throughout development—often changed weekly even daily compiling list game's needs called requirement capture prototype placeholder graphics are characteristic early game prototypes writing prototypes gameplay ideas features important activity that allows programmers game designers experiment with different algorithms usability scenarios for game great deal prototyping may take place during pre-production before design document complete may fact help determine what features design specifies when this happens prototype made physical not on computer this so easier test make changes before wasting time resources into what could be canceled idea project prototyping may also take place during active development test new ideas game emerges prototypes are often meant only act proof concept test ideas by adding modifying removing some features most algorithms features debuted prototype may be ported game once they have been completed often prototypes need be developed quickly with very little time for up-front design around minutes testing therefore usually very prolific programmers are called upon quickly code these testbed tools rad tools may be used aid quick development these programs case prototype physical form programmers designers alike will make game with paper dice other easy access tools order make prototype faster successful development model iterative prototyping where design refined based on current progress there are various technology available for video game development production production main stage development when assets source code for game are produced mainstream production usually defined period time when project fully staffed programmers write new source code artists develop game assets such sprites models sound engineers develop sound effects composers develop music for game level designers create levels writers write dialogue for cutscenes npcs game designers continue develop game's design throughout production design main article game design game design essential collaborative process designing content rules game requiring artistic technical competence well writing skills creativity open mindness vital for completion successful video game during development game designer implements modifies game design reflect current vision game features levels are often removed added art treatment may evolve backstory may change new platform may be targeted well new demographic all these changes need be documented disseminated rest team most changes occur updates design document programming main article game programming programming game handled by one more game programmers they develop prototypes test ideas many which may never make into final game programmers incorporate new features demanded by game design fix any bugs introduced during development process even if off-the-shelf game engine used great deal programming required customize almost every game level creation main article level design from time standpoint game's first level takes longest develop level designers artists use tools for level building they request features changes in-house tools that allow for quicker higher quality development newly introduced features may cause old levels become obsolete so levels developed early on may be repeatedly developed discarded because dynamic environment game development design early levels may also change over time not uncommon spend upwards twelve months on one level game developed over course three years later levels can be developed much more quickly feature set more complete game vision clearer more stable art production main article game art design ] this section needs expansion you can help by adding april audio production game audio may be separated into three categories—sound effects music voice-over sound effect production production sounds by either tweaking sample desired effect replicating with real objects sound effects are important impact game's delivery music may be synthesized performed live there are several ways which music presented game music may be ambient especially for slow periods game where music aims reinforce aesthetic mood game setting music may be triggered by in-game events for example such games pac-man mario player picking up power-ups triggered respective musical scores action music such chase battle hunting sequences fast-paced hard-changing score menu music similar credits music creates aural impact while relatively little action taking place game title with hours single-player gameplay may feature around minutes music voice-overs voice acting creates character gameplay interactivity voice acting adds personality game's characters testing main article game testing at end project quality assurance plays significant role testers start work once anything playable this may be one level subset game software that can be used any reasonable extent early on testing game occupies relatively small amount time testers may work on several games at once development draws close single game usually employs many testers full-time often with overtime they strive test new features regression test existing ones testing vital for modern complex games single changes may lead catastrophic consequences at this time features levels are being finished at highest rate there more new material be tested than during any other time project testers need carry out regression testing make sure that features that have been place for months still operate correctly regression testing one vital tasks required for effective software development new features are added subtle changes codebase can produce unexpected changes different portions game this task often overlooked for several reasons sometimes when feature implemented tested considered working for rest project little attention given repeated testing also features that are added late development are prioritized existing features often receive insufficient testing time proper regression testing also increasingly expensive number features increases often not scheduled correctly despite dangers overlooking regression testing some game developers publishers fail test full feature suite game ship game with bugs this can result customers dissatisfaction failure meet sales goals when this does happen most developers publishers quickly release patches that fix bugs make game fully playable again milestones commercial game development projects may be required meet milestones set by publisher milestones mark major events during game development are used track game's progress such milestones may be for example first playable alpha beta game versions project milestones depend on developer schedules there no industry standard for defining milestones such vary depending on publisher year project some common milestones for two-year development cycle are follows first playable first playable game version containing representative gameplay assets this first version with functional major gameplay elements often based on prototype created pre-production alpha first playable are sometimes used refer single milestone however large projects require first playable before feature complete alpha first playable occurs months before code release sometimes referred pre-alpha stage alpha see also alpha release alpha stage when key gameplay functionality implemented assets are partially finished game alpha feature complete that game playable contains all major features these features may be further revised based on testing feedback additional small new features may be added similarly planned but unimplemented features may be dropped programmers focus mainly on finishing codebase rather than implementing additions alpha occurs eight ten months before code release but this can vary significantly based on scope content assets any given game has code freeze code freeze stage when new code no longer added game only bugs are being corrected code freeze occurs three four months before code release beta see also beta release beta feature asset complete version game when only bugs are being fixed this version contains no bugs that prevent game from being shippable no changes are made game features assets code beta occurs two three months before code release code release code release stage when many bugs are fixed game ready be shipped submitted for console manufacturer review this version tested against qa test plan first code release candidate usually ready three four weeks before code release gold master see also release manufacturing gold master final game's build that used master for production game crunch time overtime expected games industry particularly crunch time crunch mode unpaid overtime requested by many companies meet project deadlines milestones that negatively affects game developers team missing deadline risks danger having project cancelled employees being laid off although many companies are reducing amount crunch time still prominent smaller companies many companies offer time-off called comp time extra paid time off after product ships compensate for crunch time's negative effects some companies offer bonuses financial rewards for successful milestone reach sometimes on-site crunch meals are offered delivered team during crunch time international game developers association igda surveyed nearly game developers produced report highlight many problems caused by bad practice post-production after game goes gold ships some developers will give team members comp time perhaps up week two compensate for overtime put complete game though this compensation not standard maintenance once game ships maintenance phase for video game begins games developed for video game consoles have had almost no maintenance period past shipped game would forever house many bugs features when released this was common for consoles since all consoles had identical nearly identical hardware making incompatibility cause many bugs non-issue this case maintenance would only occur case port sequel enhanced remake that reuses large portion engine assets recent times popularity online console games has grown online capable video game consoles online services such xbox live for xbox have developed developers can maintain their software through downloadable patches these changes would not have been possible past without widespread availability internet pc development different game developers try account for majority configurations hardware however number possible configurations hardware software inevitably leads discovery game-breaking circumstances that programmers testers didn't account for programmers wait for period get many bug reports possible once developer thinks they've obtained enough feedback programmers start working on patch patch may take weeks months develop but it's intended fix most accounted bugs problems with game that were overlooked past code release rare cases fix unintended problems caused by previous patches occasionally patch may include extra features content may even alter gameplay case massively multiplayer online game mmog such mmorpg mmorts shipment game starting phase maintenance such online games are continuous maintenance gameworld continuously changed iterated new features are added maintenance staff for popular mmog can number dozens sometimes including members original programming team outsourcing several development disciplines such audio dialogue motion capture occur for relatively short periods time efficient employment these roles requires either large development house with multiple simultaneous title production outsourcing from third-party vendors employing personnel for these tasks full-time expensive so majority developers outsource portion work outsourcing plans are conceived during pre-production stage where time finances required for outsourced work are estimated music cost ranges based on length composition method performance live synthesized composer experience minute high quality synthesized music cost between us$ 600-15k title with hours gameplay minutes music may have cost $50k-60k for its musical score voice acting well-suited for outsourcing requires set specialized skills only large publishers employ in-house voice actors sound effects can also be outsourced programming generally outsourced less than other disciplines such art music however outsourcing for extra programming work savings salaries has become more common recent years marketing game production has similar distribution methods those music film industries publisher's marketing team targets game for specific market then advertises team advises developer on target demographics market trends well suggests specific features game then advertised game's high concept incorporated into promotional material ranging from magazine ads tv spots communication between developer marketing important length purpose game demo depends on purpose demo target audience game's demo may range between few seconds such clips screenshots hours gameplay demo usually intended for journalists buyers trade shows general public internal employees who for example may need familiarize with game promote demos are produced with public relations marketing sales mind maximizing presentation effectiveness trade show demo game nears completion publisher will want showcase demo title at trade shows many games have trade show demo scheduled major annual trade shows are for example electronic entertainment expo e3 penny arcade expo pax e3 largest show north america e3 hosted primarily for marketing business deals new games platforms are announced at e3 received broad press coverage thousands products are on display press demonstration schedules are kept recent years e3 has become more closed-door event many advertisers have withdrawn reducing e3's budget pax created by authors penny arcade blog web-comic mature playful event with player-centred philosophy localization main article video game localization game created one language may also be published other countries which speak different language for that region game needs be translated for game be playable for example some games created for playstation vita were initially published japanese language like soul sacrifice non-native speakers game's original language may have wait for translation game their language but most modern big-budget games take localization into account during development process games are released for several different languages simultaneously localization actual process translating language assets game into other languages by localizing games they increase their level accessibility where games could help expend international markets effectively game localization generally known language translations yet full localization game complex project different levels translation range from zero translation being that there no translation product all things are sent raw basic translation where only few text subtitles are translated even added full translation where new voice overs game material changes are added there are various essential elements on localizing game including translating language game adjusting in-game assets for different cultures reach more potential consumers other geographies globalization for short translation seems fall into scope localization which itself constitutes substantially broader endeavor these include different levels translation globalization game itself however certain developers seem be divided on whether globalization falls under localization not moreover order fit into local markets game production companies often change redesign graphic designs packaging game for marketing purposes for example popular game assassin's creed has two different packaging designs for japanese us market by localizing graphic packaging designs companies might arouse better connections attention from consumers from various regions indie development main article independent video game development independent games indie games are produced by individuals small teams with no large-scale developer publisher affiliations indie developers generally rely on internet distribution schemes many hobbyist indie developers create mods existing games indie developers are credited for creative game ideas for example darwinia weird worlds world goo current economic viability indie development questionable however recent years internet delivery platforms such xbox live arcade steam have improved indie game success fact some indie games have become very successful such braid world goo minecraft game industry main article video game industry video game

states early history video game development prominent locale for game development was corridor from san francisco silicon valley california most new developers us open near such hot beds at present many large publishers still operate there such activision blizzard capcom entertainment disney interactive eidos interactive electronic arts foundation lucasarts entertainment namco bandai games sega america sony computer entertainment america thq however due nature game development many publishers are present other regions such big fish games washington garagegames oregon majesco new jersey microsoft corporation washington nintendo america washington take-two interactive new york southpeak interactive virginia education many universities design schools are offering classes specifically focused on game development some have built strategic alliances with major game development companies these alliances ensure that students have access latest technologies are provided opportunity find jobs within gaming industry once qualified many innovative ideas are presented at conferences such independent games festival igf game developers conference gdc indie game development may motivate students who produce game for their final projects thesis may open their own game company universities offer computer science degrees which give you strong basis knowledge if you wish become programmer stability video game industry employment fairly volatile similar other artistic industries including television music etc scores game development studios crop up work on one game then quickly go under this may be one reason why game developers tend congregate geographically if their current studio goes under developers can flock adjacent one start another from ground up industry where only top 20% products make profit it's easy understand this fluctuation numerous games may start development are cancelled perhaps even completed but never published experienced game developers may work for years yet never ship title such nature business this volatility likely inherent artistic nature games see also game development portal international game developers association
