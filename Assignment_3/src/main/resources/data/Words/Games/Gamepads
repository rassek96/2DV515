that rumble would interfere with motion sensor however was later traced immersion corporation suing both sony microsoft for patent infringement on immersion's haptic-feedback technology microsoft settled out court but sony decided fight back losing resultant case finally settling late after losing multiple appeals see immersion v sony having obtained licensing from immersion sony launched dualshock controller same sixaxis almost every way but differs that blue lettering next usb port has been changed dualshock with word sixaxis moved below contains aforementioned vibration motors which also give controller more weight plastic made from opaque rather than slightly translucent wii remote can be played with two hands like gamepad wii remote unconventional controller comparison others
