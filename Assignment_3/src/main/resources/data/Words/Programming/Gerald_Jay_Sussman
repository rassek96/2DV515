age united states fields cognitive science electrical engineering computer science institutions mit alma mater mit doctoral advisor marvin minsky seymour papert doctoral students w daniel hillis kenneth d forbus guy l steele jr david mcallester known for artificial intelligence notable awards ijcai computers thought award acm gerald jay sussman born february panasonic professor electrical engineering at massachusetts institute technology mit he received his sb phd degrees mathematics from mit respectively he has been involved artificial intelligence research at mit since his research has centered on understanding problem-solving strategies used by scientists engineers with goals automating parts process formalizing provide more effective methods science engineering education sussman has also worked computer languages computer architecture vlsi design contents academic work awards organizations see also external links references academic work sussman coauthor with hal abelson julie sussman introductory computer science textbook structure interpretation computer programs was used at mit for several decades has been translated into several languages sussman's contributions artificial intelligence include problem solving by debugging almost-right plans propagation constraints applied electrical circuit analysis synthesis dependency-based explanation dependency-based backtracking various language structures for expressing problem-solving strategies sussman his former student guy l steele jr invented scheme programming language sussman saw that artificial intelligence ideas can be applied computer-aided design sussman developed with his graduate students sophisticated computer-aided design tools for vlsi steele made first scheme chips these ideas ai-based cad technology support them were further developed scheme chips technique experience developed were then used design other special-purpose computers sussman was principal designer digital orrery machine designed do high-precision integrations for orbital mechanics experiments orrery was designed built by few people few months using ai-based simulation compilation tools using digital orrery sussman has worked with jack wisdom discover numerical evidence for chaotic motions outer planets digital orrery now retired at smithsonian institution washington dc sussman was also lead designer supercomputer toolkit another multiprocessor computer optimized for evolving systems ordinary differential equations supercomputer toolkit was used by sussman wisdom confirm extend discoveries made with digital orrery include entire planetary system sussman has pioneered use computational descriptions communicate methodological ideas teaching subjects electrical circuits signals systems over past decade sussman wisdom have developed subject that uses computational techniques communicate deeper understanding advanced classical mechanics computer science reflections on field reflections from field he writes computational algorithms are used express methods used analysis dynamical phenomena expressing methods computer language forces them be unambiguous computationally effective students are expected read programs extend them write new ones task formulating method computer-executable program debugging that program powerful exercise learning process also once formalized procedurally mathematical idea becomes tool that can be used directly compute results sussman wisdom with meinhard mayer have produced textbook structure interpretation classical mechanics capture these new ideas sussman abelson have also been part free software movement including releasing mit/gnu scheme free software serving on board directors free software foundation awards organizations for his contributions computer-science education sussman received acm's karl karlstrom outstanding educator award amar g bose award for teaching sussman hal abelson richard stallman are
