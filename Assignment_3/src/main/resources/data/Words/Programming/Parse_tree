parse tree from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search parse tree parsing tree derivation tree concrete syntax tree ordered rooted tree that represents syntactic structure string according some context-free grammar term parse tree itself used primarily computational linguistics theoretical syntax term syntax tree more common parse trees are distinct from abstract syntax trees used computer programming that their structure elements more concretely reflect syntax input language they are also distinct from although based on similar principles sentence diagrams such reed-kellogg diagrams sometimes used for grammar teaching schools parse trees are usually constructed based on either constituency relation constituency grammars phrase structure grammars dependency relation dependency grammars parse trees may be generated for sentences natural languages see natural language processing well during processing computer languages such programming languages related concept that phrase marker p-marker used transformational generative grammar phrase marker linguistic expression marked its phrase structure this may be presented form tree bracketed expression phrase markers are generated by applying phrase structure rules themselves are subject further transformational rules contents constituency-based parse trees dependency-based parse trees phrase markers see also notes references external links constituency-based parse trees constituency-based parse trees constituency grammars = phrase structure grammars distinguish between terminal non-terminal nodes interior nodes are labeled by non-terminal categories grammar while leaf nodes are labeled by terminal categories image below represents constituency-based parse tree shows syntactic structure english sentence john hit ball parse tree entire structure starting from s ending each leaf nodes john hit ball following abbreviations are used tree s for sentence top-level structure this example np for noun phrase first leftmost np single noun john serves subject sentence second one object sentence vp for verb phrase which serves predicate v for verb this case it's transitive verb hit d for determiner this instance definite article n for noun each node tree either root node branch node leaf node root node node that doesn't have any branches on top within sentence there only ever one root node branch node mother node that connects two more daughter nodes leaf node however terminal node that does not dominate other nodes tree s root node np vp are branch nodes john n hit v d ball n are all leaf nodes leaves are lexical tokens sentence node can also be referred parent node child node parent node one that has at least one other node linked by branch under example s parent both n vp child node one that has at least one node directly above which linked by branch tree from example hit child node v terms mother daughter are also sometimes used for this relationship dependency-based parse trees dependency-based parse trees dependency grammars see all nodes terminal which means they do not acknowledge distinction between terminal non-terminal categories they are simpler on average than constituency-based parse trees because they contain fewer nodes dependency-based parse tree for example sentence above follows this parse tree lacks phrasal categories s vp np seen constituency-based counterpart above like constituency-based tree constituent structure acknowledged any complete sub-tree tree constituent thus this dependency-based parse tree acknowledges subject noun john object noun phrase ball constituents just like constituency-based parse tree does constituency vs dependency distinction far-reaching whether additional syntactic structure associated with constituency-based parse trees necessary beneficial matter debate phrase markers phrase markers p-markers were introduced early transformational generative grammar developed by noam chomsky others phrase marker representing deep structure sentence generated by applying phrase structure rules this may then undergo further transformations phrase markers may be presented form trees above section on constituency-based parse trees but are often given instead form bracketed expressions which occupy less space for example bracketed expression corresponding constituency-based tree given above may be something like ] ] ] {\displaystyle \ \ ]]]} \ \ ]]]] with trees precise construction such expressions amount detail shown can depend on theory being applied on points that author wishes illustrate
