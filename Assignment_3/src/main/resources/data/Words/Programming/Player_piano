percussion mechanisms such striking bells clock was perfected long before invention piano these devices were later extended operate musical boxes which contain set tuned metal teeth plucked by player mechanism early musical instrument be automated was organ which comparatively easy operate automatically power for notes provided by air from bellows system organist player device only has operate valve control available air playing task ideally performed by pinned barrel art barrel organs was well advanced by mid-18th century piano complex instrument requiring each note be struck with different force control dynamics performance entire force required sound note must be given by performer hitting keys proved be difficult for player device combine variable percussive force controlled note duration barrels do not provide percussive force but relatively gentle switching motion early barrel pianos moved hammer back forwards continuously operator turned handle but hammers did not strike strings until moved slightly forwards by pin barrel hammers hit repeatedly until pin was removed this played note but at fixed dynamic with tremolo action quite unlike pianist development player piano was gradual overcoming various difficulties controlled percussive striking note duration earliest practical piano playing device was probably forneaux pianista which used compressed air inflate bellows when barrel pin opened valve this bellows struck piano key so played note acceleration developments leading pneumatic 'player' device started 1840s began reach some recognizable device 1870s start player period can probably be seen centennial exposition philadelphia usa at this exhibition were number automatic player devices including pianista that contained elements which would lead player earliest description piano playing device using perforated paper rolls was claude seytre's french patent concept was sound but device described was impractical way read roll operated piano alexander bain described device that used paper roll 'travelling valve' that allowed air flow through reeds reed organ simple reed pipe organs using this sort system are still being produced however air flow not sufficient drive piano mechanism charles dawson england described more complex travelling valve device which added little bain hunt & bradish usa used roll read by sprung fingers springs being strong enough operate piano mechanism directly this device applied entire playing strength paper so would have shredded rapidly device would have had be wide piano keyboard pape england submitted patent that recognized need remove playing force from paper using light springs read roll activate more robust device which plays note — mechanical amplifier first device address practical requirement operating piano mechanism was forneaux's this recognized that hard strike was needed throw hammer towards keys used traditional barrel but tripped pneumatic device that inflated bellows rapidly operate note perforated cardboard book was substituted for barrel but was still read using sprung fingers this device entered manufacture generally regarded first practical player device was exhibited philadelphia van dusen's american patent was first describe pneumatic striker operated by roll was probably based on work john mctammany leap thought occurred patent schmoele brothers they described 'double valve' system that acted pneumatic amplifier reading roll electrically operating pneumatic with electromagnet they also exhibited at philadelphia with some modification pneumatic reading roll this would become final player piano some years later although schmoele brothers never benefited from john mctammany exhibited working player philadelphia that used paper roll read using sprung fingers whose slight movement triggered mechanical player device this operated reed organ mctammany had been experimenting since mid-1860s went on be one key names early player industry he claimed be inventor 'player' but not 'player piano' — important distinction philadelphia three working devices were exhibited that between them contained almost all components that final player piano would require however was be years before all these aspects were combined surprisingly missing component was pneumatic reading roll this was all probability due lack suitably flexible airtight material translate air flow into mechanical movement needed trigger player device development 1900–1910 mechanism player piano pedal pedal connection exhauster one only shown reservoir high tension

trackerboard music roll passes over trackerboard pianola was advertised one most high-profile campaigns ever making unprecedented use full-page color advertisements cost $250 £65 equivalent over $6000 £4000 money other cheaper makes were launched standard 65-note format evolved with 1⁄4 -inch-wide mm rolls holes spaced inch although several player manufacturers used their own form roll incompatible with other makes huge sums were spent by aeolian company had more than roll titles their catalog adding titles per month many companies' catalogs ran thousands rolls mainly light religious classical music ragtime music did feature but not commonly this period player was being sold on its artistic capabilities rich buyers pioneer this decade was melville clark who introduced two key ideas full-scale roll which could play every note on piano keyboard internal player standard both ideas were ridiculed by his competitors unnecessary impractical but clark rapidly won both battles by end decade piano player device was obsolete was 65-note format this was major catastrophe for many small manufacturers who had spent all their capital on setting up 65-note player operations result was rapid consolidation industry new full-scale roll format playing all notes was agreed at industry conference buffalo so-called buffalo convention this kept 11¼-inch roll but now had smaller holes spaced at inch any player made anywhere world could now play any make roll understanding need for compatibility was defining moment player industry consensus was key avoiding costly format war which plagued almost every other form entertainment media that followed roll music while player piano matured america young inventor germany edwin welte was working on player which controlled all aspects performance automatically so that his machine would play back recorded performance exactly if original pianist was sitting at piano keyboard this device welte-mignon was launched created new marketing opportunities manufacturers could now get foremost pianists composers day record their performances on piano roll allowing owners player pianos experience such performance their own homes on their own instruments exactly original pianist had played from early days manufacturers sought create mechanisms which would pick out melody musical composition over background rest music same manner live pianist true player piano was designed be fully interactive musical experience rather than merely automatic instrument hence they are fitted with interactive control levers intended for player pianist pianolist create music performance their own taste player piano would provide aspiring pianists music lovers with technical dexterity they lacked while permitting them control musical performance interactively if they were accomplished pianist aeolian introduced metrostyle themodist latter being invention bringing out melody clearly above accompaniment with sales growing rapidly instruments themselves relatively mature this decade saw wider variety rolls become available two major advances were introduction hand-played roll both classical popular word roll hand-played rolls introduced musical phrasing into rolls so that player pianists did not have introduce through use tempo controls – something that few owners ever felt much inclination do word rolls significant innovation featured printed lyrics margins making simple use players accompany singing home very popular activity years before radio acceptable disc recordings became available other major advance was arrival major commercial rivals for welte-mignon ampico duo-art systems both launched around when world war i came german patents were seized us these two companies were left compete with each other england aeolian had huge factory sales network so easily outsold ampico estimated that perhaps 5% players sold were reproducing pianos america by end decade new 'jazz age' rise fox-trot confirmed player piano instrument popular music with classical music increasingly relegated reproducing piano most american roll companies stopped offering large classical catalogs before abandoned 'instrumental' rolls those without words within few years things were somewhat different england where aeolian company continued promote classical material receptive public word rolls never became norm england always being charged at 20% premium over non-word rolls result post-world war i american british roll collections look very different 1920–1930 1920–30 was decade that saw player piano reach its peak then its rapid decline peak sales instruments rolls were first few years decade at one point more than half all pianos being made america contained player unit player piano was not obscure by-line – was dominant force industry early 1920s many pianists note classical popular fields were called on make rolls little new technically arose through 1920s perhaps most significant was launch significantly improved form ampico system ampico b this was accompanied by automatic recording device that could record pianist's note timings dynamics technical advances 1920s were instead largely radio technology key development there was introduction amplification so that was possible sit around radio listen family unlike earlier crystal sets which required use headphones amplification was also applied recording rpm records electrical recording systems introduced around allowing major rise sound quality radio these new records rapidly eroded market for player piano was declining from mid-1920s onwards novel attempts combine appeal player piano its new rivals were made by building radios and/or phonographs into player pianos themselves but even this could not entice public continue buying player pianos when wall street crash came october player piano was already very weak position sales effectively ceased only few well-capitalized companies continued business after this many these companies were result consolidation throughout 1920s which had already seen loss most names particularly roll-making field during this period player piano pneumatic technology was used basis for aircraft training simulators by inventor edwin albert link this device powered by suction bellows moved realistically response pilot's operation controls link developed flight simulator his father's binghamton new york factory which made coin-operated pianos for commercial establishments movie theater pipe organs link company commercialized device british equivalent was silloth trainer based on duo-art technology electronic descendants these devices are now widespread 1930–1950 few companies struggled on through 1930s aeolian purchased american piano company makers ampico bring capital business they sold off all their overseas assets so large piano factory at hayes was closed sold with one month's notice gramophone company also based town joint aeolian-american operation stopped making new classical rolls concentrated on popular material final new rolls were issued late 1930s major survivor throughout this was qrs piano roll company originally offshoot melville clarke's operation owned by mid-1920s by max kortlander funded by his income composer qrs continued issue rolls all them created by j lawrence cook chief roll arranger from he supplemented his income postal worker thanks qrs roll repertoire available from 1930s 1940s other than qrs end 1930s had seen end player piano era lingering roll production england finally ceased when paper rationing made impossible continue aeolian duo-art recording machinery was destroyed by bombing during world war ii was welte factory freiburg however immediate aftermath war saw growth interest this lost era richard simonton purchased surviving welte-mignon rolls from edwin welte first disc recordings were made performances enthusiast era had tentatively begun 1950–present player piano performing during early 1950s number collectors began rescue player pianos all other instruments 1920s earlier amongst them was frank holland who formed his collection while working canada on returning england he located number like-minded enthusiasts started hold meetings at his house west london this was formalized 'the player piano group' by early 1960s frank holland had formed british piano museum now musical museum brentford america another collector was harvey roehl who was so enthused by players that he published book called player piano treasury this sold by tens thousands was followed by books on how rebuild restore these instruments harvey roehl's vestal press was major driving force raising awareness player piano within general population other societies worldwide were formed preserve study all aspects mechanical music such musical box society international mbsi automatic musical instruments collector's association amica usa max kortlander died unexpected heart attack qrs was run by his wife until she sold company ramsi tick whom found another stalwart champion whose business philosophy was not so much profit limit losses qrs's presence ensured that owners newly awakened players could purchase rolls latest titles so ensuring that instrument remained current not just historical curiosity so great was revival that 1960s production player pianos started again aeolian revived pianola albeit this time small spinet piano suited post-war housing other manufacturers followed production has continued intermittently ever since qrs today offer traditional player piano their story clark piano recent years there has been greater focus on full rebuilding original instruments finally stop working early enthusiasts could often get by with limited patching but repair requirements have slowly risen although even this day possible find original 1920s' instruments that still work after fashion – tribute their quality indication their continued popularity types steinway welte-mignon reproducing piano while there are many minor differences between manufacturers player piano piano that contains manually controlled pneumatically operating piano player mechanism intended that operator manually manipulates control levers order produce musical performance various aids human operator were developed split stack control these instruments vast majority all player pianos have pneumatic player mechanism divided into two approximately equal halves operator can lower volume either half keyboard independently other order create musical effects theme control these instruments have peripheral pneumatic hardware systems fitted which when used conjunction with special music rolls are able highlight those notes score which are intended be accented away from those whose volume desired subdue basic theme pianos subdue all notes release full power only those notes which are aligned with special music roll theme perforations more subtle systems such hupfeld's solodant aeolian's themodist have graduated theme control where background subdued level foreground melody level are both controllable nature mechanism such that where chord occurs notes be emphasised have be advanced slightly away from their neighbors order for mechanism identify them isolated theme hardware these pianos able pick out melody notes away from their background accompaniment within entire range keyboard without necessity for breaking up chords ie software workaround manufacturers these systems were uk dalian kastonome us solo carola reproducing pianos these are fully automated versions player piano requiring no human manual control order produce illusion live musical performance this achieved by utilization music rolls where tempo mapping fully incorporated into music rolls ie note lengths live performance have been captured volume dynamics are created by peripheral pneumatic expression accessories under control from system-specific music roll coding this obviates need for human manipulation manual dynamic control levers typically electric motor provides power remove human operator from necessity provide motive power by treadling most reproducing pianos are capable manual over-ride operation many are constructed for dual functionality both regular player pianos also reproducing pianos numerous companies made these utilizing different technology first successful instrument was called mignon launched by welte orchestrions these are automated instruments typically intended from use coin-operated commercial setting rather than any domestic one various manufacturers made numerous ranges instruments featuring different combinations pianos organ pipework percussion other fittings they were eventually superseded by juke box following introduction effective electrical sound amplification music rolls main article piano roll music rolls for pneumatic player pianos often known piano rolls consist continuous sheet paper rolled on spool spool fits into player piano spool box whereupon free end music sheet hooked onto take-up spool which will unwind roll at even pace across reading mechanism tracker bar music score be played programmed onto paper by means perforations different player systems have different perforation sizes channel layouts spool fittings though majority conform one two predominant formats latterly adopted industry standard music programmed via number methods music marked out on master stencil on purely metronomic basis direct from printed sheet music with player-pianists being left create their own music performance music stencil created metronomically via piano-keyboard operated punch machine live performance played onto special piano connected electronically operated marking mechanism physical stencil produced from this live output either as-is after some general regularisation tempo where necessary modern computer software midi software can be used create piano roll stencils for operating modern-day perforating machines create new titles player piano sold globally its heyday music rolls were manufactured extensively usa well most european countries south america australia new zealand large number titles from all manufacturers survive this day rolls still turn up regularly large quantities was reported that last remaining mass producer piano rolls world qrs music temporarily halted

message rex lawson roll roll scanning has made significant advances recent years applying technology possibly most obvious yet hardest all conservation preservation topics replication aging disintegrating piano rolls roll scanning process reading music roll into computerized form that can be used for any purpose such cutting new rolls operating old new instruments directly this uses same technology domestic flatbed scanners hence term roll scanner ubiquity computers makes scanning fundamental preservation rolls all types well providing basis for secondary activities such operating instruments directly roll master re-creation process understanding how roll was originally manufactured so that errors arising from scanning are removed computer works same accuracy original perforators roll factory this allows exact replica rolls be made maximizes accuracy any secondary activity replication original master from which perforated paper roll was created highest aim roll scanning roll masters are not literally replicated because they were originally large cardboard rolls but re-created computerized form rationale that starting with master this form anything can be done with music – cut new rolls operate player pianos fitted with electronic valves simulate performance for playing on modern instruments – all without introducing any errors this case because virtually all rolls were punched fixed rows where punches will occur only one row next but never between roll effectively digital storage medium scanning simply counts distance from start roll each note event giving analogue hence inaccurate representation roll if instead rows are counted result exact representation original roll – perfect digital copy this can be done by applying knowledge about original roll's creation scan once master computerized copy has been recreated all information roll retained anything done after this can be done with accuracy original roll when using analogue version all its timing errors are carried through whatever you do with this particularly true when making recut rolls where imposing punch-row spacing perforator over different row spacing original roll causes surprisingly obvious audible errors however even analogue uses scan such operating instruments directly benefits from recreated master because way removes timing errors from basic scan so doing allows accuracy scanner itself be calibrated roll scanning itself not major significance – simply adds optical technology pneumatic electrical mechanical technologies previously used extract data from perforated paper ability store extracted data on electronic media marked start modern era scanning but did little more than act substitute for paper roll most familiar such system marantz pianocorder but at least two systems were produced by wayne stahnke peter phillips operate pneumatic pianos from having performance streaming form on tape extracting note events into list computer fairly small step such computerisation scanned data adds ability edit manipulate key advance we are concerned about here manipulation that converts analogue scan data replica perforation master first
