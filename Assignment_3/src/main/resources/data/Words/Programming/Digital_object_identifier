digital object identifier from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search for use digital object identifiers on wikipedia see wikipediadigital object identifier digital object identifier acronym doi introduced managing organisation international doi foundation website doiorg digital object identifier doi type persistent identifier used uniquely identify objects doi system particularly used for electronic documents such journal articles doi system began managed by international doi foundation doi means digital identifier object rather than identifier digital object thus doi stands for digital object-identifier rather than digital-object identifier metadata about object stored association with doi name may include location such url indicating where object can be found doi for document remains fixed over lifetime document whereas its location other metadata may change referring online document by its doi provides more stable linking than simply using its url because if its url changes publisher only needs update metadata for doi link new url doi name differs from standard identifier registries such isbn isrc purpose identifier registry manage given collection identifiers whereas primary purpose doi system make collection identifiers actionable interoperable organizations that meet contractual obligations doi system are willing pay become member system can assign dois doi system implemented through federation registration agencies coordinated by international doi foundation which developed controls system doi system has been developed implemented range publishing applications since by late april more than million doi names had been assigned by some organizations by april this number had grown million doi names assigned through organizations doi system uses but not formally part handle system contents nomenclature o display applications features benefits comparison with other identifier schemes resolution organizational structure standardization see also notes references external links nomenclature doi name takes form character string divided into two parts prefix suffix separated by slash prefix identifies registrant name suffix chosen by registrant identifies specific object associated with that doi most legal unicode characters are allowed these strings which are interpreted case-insensitive manner prefix usually takes form 10nnnn where nnnn series at least numbers greater than equal whose limit depends only on total number registrants prefix may be further subdivided with periods like 10nnnnn for example doi name 101000/182 prefix suffix part prefix identifies doi registry characters prefix identify registrant this case registrant international doi foundation itself suffix item id identifying single object this case latest version doi handbook doi names can identify creative works such texts images audio video items software both electronic physical forms performances abstract works such licenses parties transaction etc names can refer objects at varying levels detail thus doi names can identify journal individual issue journal individual article journal single table that article choice level detail left assigner but doi system must be declared part metadata that associated with doi name using data dictionary based on indecs content model display official doi handbook explicitly states that dois should display on screens print format doi101000/182 contrary doi handbook crossref major doi registration agency recommends displaying url for example https//doiorg/101000/182 instead officially specified format for example doi101000/182 this url provides location http proxy server which will redirect web accesses correct online location linked item this recommendation primarily based on assumption that doi being displayed without being hyper-linked its appropriate url – argument being that without hyperlink not easy copy-and-paste full url actually bring up page for doi thus entire url should be displayed allowing people viewing page containing doi copy-and-paste url by hand into new window/tab their browser order go appropriate page for document doi represents applications major applications doi system currently include scholarly materials journal articles books ebooks etc through crossref consortium around publishers research datasets through datacite consortium leading research libraries technical information providers scientific data centers european union official publications through eu publications office permanent global identifiers for commercial video content through entertainment id registry commonly known eidr organisation for economic co-operation development's publication service oecd ilibrary each table graph oecd publication shown with doi name that leads excel file data underlying tables graphs further development such services planned multilingual european doi registration agency activity medra traditional chinese content thru airiti inc chinese registration agency wanfang data are active non-english language markets expansion other sectors planned by international doi foundation features benefits doi system was designed provide form persistent identification which each doi name permanently unambiguously identifies object which associated associates metadata with objects allowing provide users with relevant pieces information about objects their relationships included part this metadata are network actions that allow doi names be resolved web locations where objects they describe can be found achieve its goals doi system combines handle system indecs content model with social infrastructure handle system ensures that doi name for object not based on any changeable attributes object such its physical location ownership that attributes object are encoded its metadata rather than its doi name that no two objects are assigned same doi name because doi names are short character strings they are human-readable may be copied pasted text fit into uri specification doi name resolution mechanism acts behind scenes so that users communicate with same way with any other web service built on open architectures incorporates trust mechanisms engineered operate reliably flexibly so that can be adapted changing demands new applications doi system doi name resolution may be used with openurl select most appropriate among multiple locations for given object according location user making request however despite this ability doi system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users non-free copies documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations indecs content model used within doi system associate metadata with objects small kernel common metadata shared by all doi names can be optionally extended with other relevant data which may be public restricted registrants may update metadata for their doi names at any time such when publication information changes when object moves different url international doi foundation idf oversees integration these technologies operation system through technical social infrastructure social infrastructure federation independent registration agencies offering doi services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments identifiers such gs1 isbn comparison with other identifier schemes doi name differs from commonly used internet pointers material such uniform resource locator url that identifies object itself first-class entity rather than specific place where object located at certain time implements uniform resource identifier uniform resource name concept adds data model social infrastructure doi name also differs from standard identifier registries such isbn isrc etc purpose identifier registry manage given collection identifiers whereas primary purpose doi system make collection identifiers actionable interoperable where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections doi system offers persistent semantically-interoperable resolution related current data best suited material that will be used services outside direct control issuing assigner eg public citation managing content value uses managed registry providing social technical infrastructure does not assume any specific business model for provision identifiers services enables other existing services link defined ways several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed comparison persistent identifier approaches difficult because they are not all doing same thing imprecisely referring set schemes identifiers doesn't mean that they can be compared easily other identifier systems may be enabling technologies with low barriers entry providing easy use labeling mechanism that allows anyone set up new instance examples include persistent uniform resource locator purl urls globally unique identifiers guids etc but may lack some functionality registry-controlled scheme will usually lack accompanying metadata controlled scheme doi system does not have this approach should not be compared directly such identifier schemes various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some features offered by doi system for specific sectors eg ark doi name does not depend on object's location this way similar uniform resource name urn purl but differs from ordinary url urls are often used substitute identifiers for documents on internet better characterised uniform resource identifiers although same document at two different locations has two urls by contrast persistent identifiers such doi names identify objects first class entities two instances same object would have same doi name resolution doi name resolution provided through handle system developed by corporation for national research initiatives freely available any user encountering doi name resolution redirects user from doi name one more pieces typed data urls representing instances object services such e-mail one more items metadata handle system doi name handle so has set values assigned may be thought record that consists group fields each handle value must have data type specified its field which defines syntax semantics its data resolve doi name may be input doi resolver eg doiorg may be represented http string by preceding doi name by string https//doiorg/ preferred https//dxdoiorg/ for example doi name 101000/182 can be resolved at address https//doiorg/101000/182 web pages other hypertext documents can include hypertext links this form some browsers allow direct resolution doi other handles with add-on eg cnri handle extension for firefox cnri handle extension for firefox enables browser access handle doi uris like hdl4263537/4000 doi101000/1 using native handle system protocol will even replace references web-to-handle proxy servers with native resolution alternative doi resolvers include last unusual that tries find non-paywalled version title redirects you that instead publisher's version organizational structure international doi foundation idf

planning its activities membership open all organizations with interest electronic publishing related enabling technologies idf holds annual open meetings on topics doi related issues registration agencies appointed by idf provide services doi registrants they allocate doi prefixes register doi names provide necessary infrastructure allow registrants declare maintain metadata state data registration agencies are also expected actively promote widespread adoption doi system cooperate with idf development doi system whole provide services on behalf their specific user community list current ras maintained by international doi foundation registration agencies generally charge fee assign new doi name parts these fees are used support idf doi system overall through idf operates on
