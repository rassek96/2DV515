android runtime from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search comparison dalvik art architectures android runtime art application runtime environment used by android operating system replacing dalvik which process virtual machine originally used by android art performs translation application's bytecode into native instructions that are later executed by device's runtime environment android froyo brought trace-based just-in-time jit compilation into dalvik optimizing execution applications by continually profiling applications each time they run dynamically compiling frequently executed short segments their bytecode into native machine code while dalvik interprets rest application's bytecode native execution those short bytecode segments called traces provides significant performance improvements unlike dalvik art introduces use ahead-of-time aot compilation by compiling entire applications into native machine code upon their installation by eliminating dalvik's interpretation trace-based jit compilation art improves overall execution efficiency reduces power consumption which results improved battery autonomy on mobile devices at same time art brings faster execution applications improved memory allocation garbage collection gc mechanisms new applications debugging features more accurate high-level profiling applications maintain backward compatibility art uses same input bytecode dalvik supplied through standard dex files part apk files while odex files are replaced with executable linkable format elf executables once application compiled by using art's on-device dex2oat utility run solely from compiled elf executable result art eliminates various application execution overheads associated with dalvik's interpretation trace-based jit compilation downside art requires additional time for compilation when application installed applications take up slightly larger amounts secondary storage which usually flash memory store compiled code android kitkat brought technology preview art including alternative runtime environment keeping dalvik default virtual machine subsequent major android release android lollipop
