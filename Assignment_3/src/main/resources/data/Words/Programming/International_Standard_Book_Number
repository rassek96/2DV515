this might occur once all registrant elements from particular registration group have been allocated publishers by using variable block lengths registration agencies are able customise allocations isbns that they make publishers for example large publisher may be given block isbns where fewer digits are allocated for registrant element many digits are allocated for publication element likewise

corresponding digit isbn does not provide same protection against transposition this because thirteen digit code was required be compatible with ean format hence could not contain x isbn-10 check digits edition official manual international isbn agency says that isbn-10 check digit – which last digit ten-digit isbn – must range from symbol x used for must be such that sum all ten digits each multiplied by its integer weight descending from multiple for example for isbn-10 0-306-40615-2 s = × + × + × + × + × + × + × + × + × + × = + + + + + + + + + = = × {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}s&=0\times 10+3\times 9+0\times 8+6\times 7+4\times 6+0\times 5+6\times 4+1\times 3+5\times 2+2\times 1\\&=0+27+0+42+24+0+24+3+10+2\\&=132=12\times 11\end{aligned}}} formally using modular arithmetic we can say x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x ≡ mod {\displaystyle 10x{1}+9x{2}+8x{3}+7x{4}+6x{5}+5x{6}+4x{7}+3x{8}+2x{9}+x{10}\equiv 0{\pmod {11}}} also true for isbn-10's that sum all ten digits each multiplied by its weight ascending order from multiple for this example s = × + × + × + × + × + × + × + × + × + × = + + + + + + + + + = = × {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}s&=0\times 1+3\times 2+0\times 3+6\times 4+4\times 5+0\times 6+6\times 7+1\times 8+5\times 9+2\times 10\\&=0+6+0+24+20+0+42+8+45+20\\&=165=15\times 11\end{aligned}}} formally we can say x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x ≡ mod {\displaystyle x{1}+2x{2}+3x{3}+4x{4}+5x{5}+6x{6}+7x{7}+8x{8}+9x{9}+10x{10}\equiv 0{\pmod {11}}} two most common errors handling isbn eg typing writing are single altered digit transposition adjacent digits can be proved that all possible valid isbn-10's have at least two digits different from each other can also be proved that there are no pairs valid isbn-10's with eight identical digits two transposed digits these are true only because isbn less than digits long because prime number isbn check digit method therefore ensures that will always be possible detect these two most common types error ie if either these types error has occurred result will never be valid isbn – sum digits multiplied by their weights will never be multiple however if error occurs publishing house goes undetected book will be issued with invalid isbn contrast possible for other types error such two altered non-transposed digits three altered digits result valid isbn number although still unlikely isbn-10 check digit calculation modular arithmetic convenient for calculating check digit using modulus each first nine digits ten-digit isbn—excluding check digit itself—is multiplied by number sequence from remainder sum with respect computed resulting remainder plus check digit must equal multiple either therefore check digit minus remainder sum products modulo modulo taking remainder modulo second time accounts for possibility that first remainder without second modulo operation calculation could end up with – = which invalid strictly speaking first modulo unneeded but may be considered simplify calculation for example check digit for isbn-10 0-306-40615- calculated follows s = − × + × + × + × + × + × + × + × + × mod mod = − + + + + + + + + mod mod = − mod mod = − mod = mod = {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}s&=11-0\times 10+3\times 9+0\times 8+6\times 7+4\times 6+0\times 5+6\times 4+1\times 3+5\times 2\{\bmod {\}}11\{\bmod {\}}11\\&=11-0+27+0+42+24+0+24+3+10\{\bmod {\}}11\{\bmod {\}}11\\&=11-130\{\bmod {\}}11\{\bmod {\}}11=11-9\{\bmod {\}}11=2\{\bmod {\}}11=2\end{aligned}}} thus check digit complete sequence isbn 0-306-40615-2 value x {\displaystyle x{10}} required satisfy this condition might be if so 'x' should be used possible avoid multiplications software implementation by using two accumulators repeatedly adding t into s computes necessary multiples // returns isbn error syndrome zero for valid isbn non-zero for invalid one // digits must be between int checkisbnint const digits { int i s =
