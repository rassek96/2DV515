standard library from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search standard library computer programming library made available across implementations programming language these libraries are conventionally described programming language specifications however contents language's associated library may also be determined part whole by more informal practices language's community language's standard library often treated part language by its users although designers may have treated separate entity many language specifications define core set that must be made available all implementations addition other portions which may be optionally implemented line between language its libraries therefore differs from language language indeed some languages are designed so that meanings certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring core library for example java string literal defined instance javalangstring class similarly smalltalk anonymous function expression block constructs instance library's blockcontext class conversely scheme contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice construct rest language library macros so language designers do not even bother say which portions language must be implemented language constructs which must be implemented parts library contents contents philosophies examples standard libraries references contents standard libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms data structures mechanisms for input output depending on constructs made available by host language standard library may include subroutines macro definitions global variables class definitions templates most standard libraries include definitions for at least following commonly used facilities algorithms such sorting algorithms data structures such lists trees hash tables interaction with host platform including input/output operating system calls philosophies philosophies standard library design vary widely for example bjarne stroustrup designer c++ writes what ought be standard c++ library one ideal for programmer be able find every interesting significant reasonably general class function template etc library however question here not what ought be some library but what ought be standard library answer everything reasonable first approximation answer former question but not latter standard library something every implementer must supply so that every programmer can rely on this suggests relatively small standard library containing only constructs that every programmer might reasonably require when building large collection software this philosophy that used c c++ standard libraries by contrast guido van rossum designer python has embraced much more inclusive vision standard library python tutorial he writes python has batteries included philosophy this best seen through sophisticated robust capabilities its larger packages van rossum goes on list libraries for processing xml xml-rpc email messages localization facilities that c++ standard library omits this other philosophy often found scripting languages python ruby languages that use virtual machine such java net framework languages c++ such facilities are not part standard library but instead other libraries such boost examples standard libraries this article contains embedded lists that may be
