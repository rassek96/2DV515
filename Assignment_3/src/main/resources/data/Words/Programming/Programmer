germany programmer computer programmer developer dev coder software engineer person who writes computer software term computer programmer can refer specialist one area computer programming generalist who writes code for many kinds software one who practices professes formal approach programming may also be known programmer analyst programmer's primary computer language assembly cobol c c++ c java lisp python etc often prefixed these titles those who work web environment often prefix their titles with web term programmer can be used refer software developer web developer mobile applications developer embedded firmware developer software engineer computer scientist software analyst however members these professions possess other software engineering skills beyond programming for this reason term programmer code monkey sometimes considered insulting derogatory oversimplification these other professions this has sparked much debate amongst developers analysts computer scientists programmers outsiders who continue be puzzled at subtle differences definitions these occupations contents history nature work o testing debugging o application versus system programming o types software globalization o market changes uk o market changes us see also references further reading external links history ada lovelace considered by many first computer programmer british countess mathematician ada lovelace often considered first computer programmer she was first publish algorithm intended for implementation on charles babbage's analytical engine october intended for calculation bernoulli numbers because babbage's machine was never completed functioning standard her time she never saw this algorithm run first person run program on functioning modern electronically based computer was computer scientist konrad zuse eniac programming team consisting kay mcnulty betty jennings betty snyder marlyn wescoff fran bilas ruth lichterman were first regularly working programmers international programmers' day celebrated annually on january government russia decreed professional annual holiday known programmers' day be celebrated on september september leap years had also been unofficial international holiday before that nature work some this section from occupational outlook handbook 2006–07 edition which public domain work united states government computer programmers write test debug maintain detailed instructions called computer programs that computers must follow perform their functions programmers also conceive design test logical structures for solving problems by computer many technical innovations programming — advanced computing technologies sophisticated new languages programming tools — have redefined role programmer elevated much programming work done today job titles descriptions may vary depending on organization programmers work many settings including corporate information technology departments big software companies small service firms government entities all sizes many professional programmers also work for consulting companies at client sites contractors licensing not typically required work programmer although professional certifications are commonly held by programmers programming widely considered profession although some authorities disagree on grounds that only careers with legal licensing requirements count profession programmers' work varies widely depending on type business for which they are writing programs for example instructions involved updating financial records are very different from those required duplicate conditions on aircraft for pilots training flight simulator simple programs can be written few hours more complex ones may require more than year work while others are never considered 'complete' but rather are continuously improved long they stay use most cases several programmers work together team under senior programmer’s supervision computer programmer writing java code programmers write programs according specifications determined primarily by more senior programmers by systems analysts after design process complete job programmer convert that design into logical series instructions that computer can follow programmer codes these instructions one many programming languages different programming languages are used depending on purpose program cobol for example commonly used for business applications that typically run on mainframe midrange computers whereas fortran used science engineering c++ widely used for both scientific business applications java c vb php are popular programming languages for web business applications programmers generally know more than one programming language because many languages are similar they often can learn new languages relatively easily practice programmers often are referred by language they know eg java programmers by type function they perform environment which they work for example database programmers mainframe programmers web developers when making changes source code that programs are made up programmers need make other programmers aware task that routine perform they do this by inserting comments source code so that others can understand program more easily by documenting their code save work programmers often use libraries basic code that can be modified customized for specific application this approach yields more reliable consistent programs increases programmers' productivity by eliminating some routine steps testing debugging programmers test program by running looking for bugs errors they are identified programmer usually makes appropriate corrections then rechecks program until acceptably low level severity bugs remain this process called testing debugging these are important parts every programmer's job programmers may continue fix these problems throughout life program updating repairing modifying expanding existing programs sometimes called maintenance programming programmers may contribute user guides online help they may work with technical writers do such work application versus system programming computer programmers often are grouped into two broad types application programmers systems programmers application programmers write programs handle specific job such program track inventory within organization they also may revise existing packaged software customize generic applications which are frequently purchased from independent software vendors systems programmers contrast write programs maintain control computer systems software such operating systems database management systems these workers make changes instructions that determine how network workstations cpu system handle various jobs they have been given how they communicate with peripheral equipment such printers disk drives types software programmers software development companies may work directly with experts from various fields create software – either programs designed for specific clients packaged software for general use – ranging from video games educational software programs for desktop publishing financial planning programming packaged software constitutes one most rapidly growing segments computer services industry some companies organizations – even small ones – have set up their own team ensure design development in-house software answer very specific needs from their internal end-users especially when existing software are not suitable too expensive this for example case research laboratories some organizations particularly small ones people commonly known programmer analysts are responsible for both systems analysis actual programming work transition from mainframe environment one that based primarily on personal computers pcs has blurred once rigid distinction between programmer user increasingly adept end users are taking over many tasks previously performed by programmers for example growing use packaged software such spreadsheet database management software packages allows users write simple programs access data perform calculations addition rise internet has made web development huge part programming field currently more software applications are web applications that can be used by anyone with web browser examples such applications include google search service outlookcom e-mail service flickr photo-sharing service programming editors also known source code editors are text editors that are specifically designed for programmers developers for writing source code application program most these editors include features useful for programmers which may include color syntax highlighting auto indentation auto-complete bracket matching syntax check allows plug-ins these features aid users during coding debugging testing globalization examples perspective this article deal primarily with united states do not represent worldwide view subject you may improve this
