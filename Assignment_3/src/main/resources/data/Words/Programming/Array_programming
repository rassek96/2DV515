programming language one-liners that require more than couple pages java code modern programming languages that support array programming are commonly used scientific engineering settings these

programming model allows programmer think operate on whole aggregates data without having resort explicit loops individual scalar operations iverson described rationale behind array programming actually referring apl follows most programming languages are decidedly inferior mathematical notation are little used tools thought ways that would be considered significant by say applied mathematician thesis that advantages executability universality found programming languages can be effectively combined single coherent language with advantages offered by mathematical notation important distinguish difficulty describing learning piece notation from difficulty mastering its implications for example learning rules for computing matrix product easy but mastery its implications such its associativity its distributivity over addition its ability represent linear functions geometric operations different much more difficult matter indeed very suggestiveness notation may make seem harder learn because many properties suggests for explorations users computers programming languages are often concerned primarily with efficiency execution algorithms might therefore summarily dismiss many algorithms presented here such dismissal would be short-sighted since clear statement algorithm can usually be used basis from which one may easily derive more efficient algorithm basis behind array programming thinking find exploit properties data where individual elements are similar adjacent unlike object orientation which implicitly breaks down data its constituent parts scalar quantities array orientation looks group data apply uniform handling function rank important concept array programming languages general by analogy tensor rank mathematics functions that operate on data may be classified by number dimensions they act on ordinary multiplication for example scalar ranked function because operates on zero-dimensional data individual numbers cross product operation example vector rank function because operates on vectors not scalars matrix multiplication example 2-rank function because operates on 2-dimensional objects matrices collapse operators reduce dimensionality input data array by one more dimensions for example summing over elements collapses input array by dimension uses array programming very well suited implicit parallelization topic much research nowadays further intel compatible cpus developed produced after contained various instruction set extensions starting from mmx continuing through ssse3 3dnow which include rudimentary simd array capabilities array processing distinct from parallel processing that one physical processor performs operations on group items simultaneously while parallel processing aims split larger problem into smaller ones mimd be solved piecemeal by numerous processors processors with two more cores are increasingly common today languages canonical examples array programming languages are apl j fortran others include d a+ analytica chapel idl julia k q mata mathematica matlab molsf numpy gnu octave pdl r s-lang sac nial zpl scalar languages scalar languages such c pascal operations apply only single values so a+b expresses addition two numbers such languages adding one array another requires indexing looping coding which tedious error-prone for i = i > b b > c c > d d > d + c1 c creates vector mathematical reasoning language notation matrix left-division operator concisely expresses some semantic properties matrices scalar equivalent if determinant coefficient matrix not null then possible solve vectorial equation x = b by left-multiplying both sides by inverse a−1 both matlab gnu octave languages a^-1 following mathematical statements hold when full rank square matrix a^-1 x==a^-1 b a^-1 x ==a^-1 b matrix-multiplication associativity x = a^-1 b where == equivalence relational operator previous statements are also valid matlab expressions if third one executed before others numerical comparisons may be false because round-off errors if system overdetermined - so that has more rows than columns - pseudoinverse a+ matlab gnu octave languages pinva can replace inverse a−1 follows pinva x==pinva b pinva x ==pinva b matrix-multiplication associativity x = pinva b however these solutions are neither most concise ones eg still remains need notationally differentiate overdetermined systems nor most computationally efficient latter point easy understand when considering again scalar equivalent x = b for which solution x = a^-1 b would require two operations instead more efficient x = b / problem that generally matrix multiplications are not commutative extension scalar solution matrix case would require x/ ==b / x a/ ==b / commutativity does not hold for matrices x / a==b / associativity also holds for matrices x = b / matlab language introduces left-division operator \ maintain essential part analogy with scalar case therefore simplifying mathematical reasoning preserving conciseness \ x==a \ b \ x ==a \ b associativity also holds for matrices commutativity no more required x = \ b this not only example terse array programming from coding point view but also from computational efficiency perspective which several array programming languages benefits from quite efficient linear algebra libraries such atlas lapack returning previous quotation iverson rationale behind should now be evident important distinguish difficulty describing learning piece notation from difficulty mastering its implications for example learning rules for computing matrix product easy but mastery its implications such its associativity its distributivity over addition its ability represent linear functions geometric operations different much more difficult matter indeed very suggestiveness notation may make seem harder learn because many properties suggests for explorations third-party libraries use specialized efficient libraries provide more terse abstractions also common other programming languages c++ several linear algebra libraries exploit language ability overload operators some cases very terse abstraction
