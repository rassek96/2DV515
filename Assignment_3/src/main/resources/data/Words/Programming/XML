has also provided base language for communication protocols such xmpp applications for microsoft net framework use xml files for configuration apple has implementation registry based on xml xml has come into common use for interchange data over internet ietf rfc gives rules for construction internet media types for use when sending xml also defines media types application/xml text/xml which say only that data xml nothing about its semantics use text/xml has been criticized potential source encoding problems has been suggested that should be deprecated rfc also recommends that xml-based languages be given media types ending +xml for example image/svg+xml for svg further guidelines for use xml networked context appear rfc also known ietf bcp document covering many aspects designing deploying xml-based language key terminology material this section based on xml specification this not exhaustive list all constructs that appear xml provides introduction key constructs most often encountered day-to-day use character xml document string characters almost every legal unicode character may appear xml document processor application processor analyzes markup passes structured information application specification places requirements on what xml processor must do not do but application outside its scope processor specification calls often referred colloquially xml parser markup content characters making up xml document are divided into markup content which may be distinguished by application simple syntactic rules generally strings that constitute markup either begin with character they begin with character & end with strings characters that are not markup are content however cdata section delimiters are classified markup while text between them classified content addition whitespace before after outermost element classified markup tag tag markup construct that begins with tags come three flavors start-tag such end-tag such empty-element tag such element element logical document component that either begins with start-tag ends with matching end-tag consists only empty-element tag characters between start-tag end-tag if any are element's content may contain markup including other elements which are called child elements example hello world another attribute attribute markup construct consisting name–value pair that exists within start-tag empty-element tag example where name attributes are src alt their values are madonnajpg madonna respectively another example connect b where name attribute number its value xml attribute can only have single value each attribute can appear at most once on each element common situation where list multiple values desired this must be done by encoding list into well-formed xml attribute with some format beyond what xml defines itself usually this either comma semi-colon delimited list if individual values are known not contain spaces space-delimited list can be used welcome where attribute class has both value inner greeting-box also indicates two css class names inner greeting-box xml declaration xml documents may begin with xml declaration that describes some information about themselves example characters escaping xml documents consist entirely characters from unicode repertoire except for small number specifically excluded control characters any character defined by unicode may appear within content xml document xml includes facilities for identifying encoding unicode characters that make up document for expressing characters that for one reason another cannot be used directly valid characters main article valid characters xml unicode code points following ranges are valid xml documents u+0009 horizontal tab u+000a line feed u+000d carriage return these are only c0 controls accepted xml u+0020–u+d7ff u+e000–u+fffd this excludes some not all non-characters bmp all surrogates u+fffe u+ffff are forbidden u+10000–u+10ffff this includes all code points supplementary planes including non-characters xml extends set allowed characters include all above plus remaining characters range u+0001–u+001f at same time however restricts use c0 c1 control characters other than u+0009 horizontal tab u+000a line feed u+000d carriage return u+0085 next line by requiring them be written escaped form for example u+0001 must be written &x01 its equivalent case c1 characters this restriction backwards incompatibility was introduced allow common encoding errors be detected code point u+0000 null only character that not permitted any xml document encoding detection unicode character set can be encoded into bytes for storage transmission variety different ways called encodings unicode itself defines encodings that cover entire repertoire well-known ones include utf-8 utf-16 there are many other text encodings that predate unicode such ascii iso/iec their character repertoires almost every case are subsets unicode character set xml allows use any unicode-defined encodings any other encodings whose characters also appear unicode xml also provides mechanism whereby xml processor can reliably without any prior knowledge determine which encoding being used encodings other than utf-8 utf-16 are not necessarily recognized by every xml parser escaping xml provides escape facilities for including characters that are problematic include directly for example characters &amp represents & &apos represents ' &quot represents '' all permitted unicode characters may be represented with numeric character reference consider chinese character 中 whose numeric code unicode hexadecimal decimal user whose keyboard offers no method for entering this character could still insert xml document encoded either &20013 &x4e2d similarly string i for compatibility with sgml string -- double-hyphen not allowed inside comments this means comments cannot be nested ampersand has no special significance within comments so entity character references are not recognized such there no way represent characters outside character set document encoding example valid comment & such comments--> international use this example contains chinese text without proper rendering support you may see question marks boxes other symbols instead chinese characters this example contains cyrillic text without proper rendering support you may see question marks boxes misplaced vowels missing conjuncts instead cyrillic letters xml fifth edition xml support direct use almost any unicode character element names attributes comments character data processing instructions other than ones that have special symbolic meaning xml itself such less-than sign данные well-formedness error-handling main article well-formed document xml specification defines xml document well-formed text meaning that satisfies list syntax rules provided specification some key points fairly lengthy list include document contains only properly encoded legal unicode characters none special syntax characters such @^`{|}~ nor space character cannot begin with - numeric digit single root element contains all other elements definition xml document excludes texts that contain violations well-formedness rules they are simply not xml xml processor that encounters such violation required report such errors cease normal processing this policy occasionally referred draconian error handling stands notable contrast behavior programs that process html which are designed produce reasonable result even presence severe markup errors xml's policy this area has been criticized violation postel's law be conservative what you send be liberal what you accept xml specification defines valid xml document well-formed xml document which also conforms rules document type definition dtd schemas validation addition being well-formed xml document may be valid this means that contains reference document type definition dtd that its elements attributes are declared that dtd follow grammatical rules for them that dtd specifies xml processors are classified validating non-validating depending on whether not they check xml documents for validity processor that discovers validity error must be able report but may continue normal processing dtd example schema grammar since initial publication xml there has been substantial work area schema languages for xml such schema languages typically constrain set elements that may be used document which attributes may be applied them order which they may appear allowable parent/child relationships document type definition main article document type definition oldest schema language for xml document type definition dtd inherited from sgml dtds have following benefits dtd support ubiquitous due its inclusion xml standard dtds are terse compared element-based schema languages consequently present more information single screen dtds allow declaration standard public entity sets for publishing characters dtds define document type rather than types used by namespace thus grouping all constraints for document single collection dtds have following limitations they have no explicit support for newer features xml most importantly namespaces they lack expressiveness xml dtds are simpler than sgml dtds there are certain structures that cannot be expressed with regular grammars dtds only support rudimentary datatypes they lack readability dtd designers typically make heavy use parameter entities which behave essentially textual macros which make easier define complex grammars but at expense clarity they use syntax based on regular expression syntax inherited from sgml describe schema typical xml apis such sax do not attempt offer applications structured representation syntax so less accessible programmers than element-based syntax may be two peculiar features that distinguish dtds from other schema types are syntactic support for embedding dtd within xml documents for defining entities which are arbitrary fragments text and/or markup that xml processor inserts dtd itself xml document wherever they are referenced like character escapes dtd technology still used many applications because its ubiquity xml schema main article xml schema w3c newer schema language described by w3c successor dtds xml schema often referred by initialism for xml schema instances xsd xml schema definition xsds are far more powerful than dtds describing xml languages they use rich datatyping system allow for more detailed constraints on xml document's logical structure xsds also use xml-based format which makes possible use ordinary xml tools help process them xsschema element that defines schema relax ng relax ng regular language for xml next generation was initially specified by oasis now also iso/iec standard part regular-grammar-based validation iso/iec standard dsdl relax ng schemas may be written either xml based syntax more compact non-xml syntax two syntaxes are isomorphic james clark's conversion tool—trang —can convert between them without loss information relax ng has simpler definition validation framework than xml schema making easier use implement also has ability use datatype framework plug-ins relax ng schema author for example can require values xml document conform definitions xml schema datatypes schematron schematron language for making assertions about presence absence patterns xml document typically uses xpath expressions schematron now also iso/iec standard part rule-based validation iso/iec standard dsdl dsdl other schema languages dsdl document schema definition languages multi-part iso/iec standard iso/iec that brings together comprehensive set small schema languages each targeted at specific problems dsdl includes relax ng full compact syntax schematron assertion language languages for defining datatypes character repertoire constraints renaming entity expansion namespace-based routing document fragments different validators dsdl schema languages do not have vendor support xml schemas yet are some extent grassroots reaction industrial publishers lack utility xml schemas for publishing some schema languages not only describe structure particular xml format but also offer limited facilities influence processing individual xml files that conform this format dtds xsds both have this ability they can for instance provide infoset augmentation facility attribute defaults relax ng schematron intentionally do not provide these related specifications cluster specifications closely related xml have been developed starting soon after initial publication xml frequently case that term xml used refer xml together with one more these other technologies that have come be seen part xml core xml namespaces enable same document contain xml elements attributes taken from different vocabularies without any naming collisions occurring although xml namespaces are not part xml specification itself virtually all xml software also supports xml namespaces xml base defines xmlbase attribute which may be used set base for resolution relative uri references within scope single xml element xml information set xml infoset abstract data model for xml documents terms information items infoset commonly used specifications xml languages for convenience describing constraints on xml constructs those languages allow xsl extensible stylesheet language family languages used transform render xml documents split into three parts xslt xsl transformations xml language for transforming xml documents into other xml documents other formats such html plain text xsl-fo xslt very tightly coupled with xpath which uses address components input xml document mainly elements attributes xsl-fo xsl formatting objects xml language for rendering xml documents often used generate pdfs xpath xml path language non-xml language for addressing components elements attributes so on xml document xpath widely used other core-xml specifications programming libraries for accessing xml-encoded data xquery xml query xml query language strongly rooted xpath xml schema provides methods access manipulate return xml mainly conceived query language for xml databases xml signature defines syntax processing rules for creating digital signatures on xml content xml encryption defines syntax processing rules for encrypting xml content some other specifications conceived part xml core have failed find wide adoption including xinclude xlink xpointer programming interfaces design goals xml include shall be easy write programs which process xml documents despite this xml specification contains almost no information about how programmers might go about doing such processing xml infoset specification provides vocabulary refer constructs within xml document but also does not provide any guidance on how access this information variety apis for accessing xml have been developed used some have been standardized existing apis for xml processing tend fall into these categories stream-oriented apis accessible from programming language for example sax stax tree-traversal apis accessible from programming language for example dom xml data binding which provides automated translation between xml document programming-language objects declarative transformation languages such xslt xquery stream-oriented facilities require less memory for certain tasks based on linear traversal xml document are faster simpler than other alternatives tree-traversal data-binding apis typically require use much more memory but are often found more convenient for use by programmers some include declarative retrieval document components via use xpath expressions xslt designed for declarative description xml document transformations has been widely implemented both server-side packages web browsers xquery overlaps xslt its functionality but designed more for searching large xml databases simple api for xml main article simple api for xml simple api for xml sax lexical event-driven api which document read serially its contents are reported callbacks various methods on handler object user's design sax fast efficient implement but difficult use for extracting information at random from xml since tends burden application author with keeping track what part document being processed better suited situations which certain types information are always handled same way no matter where they occur document pull parsing pull parsing treats document series items read sequence using iterator design pattern this allows for writing recursive descent parsers which structure code performing parsing mirrors structure xml being parsed intermediate parsed results can be used accessed local variables within methods performing parsing passed down method parameters into lower-level methods returned method return values higher-level methods examples pull parsers include stax java programming language xmlpullparser smalltalk xmlreader php elementtreeiterparse python systemxmlxmlreader net framework dom traversal api nodeiterator treewalker pull parser creates iterator that sequentially visits various elements attributes data xml document code that uses this iterator can test current item tell for example whether start-tag end-tag text inspect its attributes local name namespace values xml attributes value text etc can also move iterator next item code can thus extract information from document traverses recursive-descent approach tends lend itself keeping data typed local variables code doing parsing while sax for instance typically requires parser manually maintain intermediate data within stack elements that are parent elements element being parsed pull-parsing code can be more straightforward understand maintain than sax parsing code document object model main article document object model document object model dom api that allows for navigation entire document if were tree node objects representing document's contents dom document can be created by parser can be generated manually by users with limitations data types dom nodes are abstract implementations provide their own programming language-specific bindings dom implementations tend be memory intensive they generally require entire document be loaded into memory constructed tree objects before access allowed data binding xml data binding binding xml documents hierarchy custom strongly typed objects contrast generic objects created by dom parser this approach simplifies code development many cases allows problems be identified at compile time rather than run-time example data binding systems include java architecture for xml binding jaxb xml serialization net framework xml data type xml has appeared first-class data type other languages ecmascript for xml e4x extension ecmascript/javascript language explicitly defines two specific objects xml xmllist for javascript which support xml document nodes xml node lists distinct objects use dot-notation specifying parent-child relationships e4x supported by mozilla 25+ browsers though now deprecated adobe actionscript but has not been adopted more universally similar notations are used microsoft's linq implementation for microsoft net above scala which uses java vm open-source xmlsh application which provides linux-like shell with special features for xml manipulation similarly treats xml data type using notation resource description framework defines data type rdfxmlliteral hold wrapped canonical xml facebook has produced extensions php javascript languages that add xml core syntax similar fashion e4x namely xhp jsx respectively history xml application profile sgml iso versatility sgml for dynamic information display was understood by early digital media publishers late 1980s prior rise internet by mid-1990s some practitioners sgml had gained experience with then-new world wide web believed that sgml offered solutions some problems web was likely face grew dan connolly added sgml list w3c's activities when he joined staff work began mid-1996 when sun microsystems engineer jon bosak developed charter recruited collaborators bosak was well connected small community people who had experience both sgml web xml was compiled by working group eleven members supported by roughly 150-member interest group technical debate took place on interest group mailing list issues were resolved by consensus when that failed majority vote working group record design decisions their rationales was compiled by michael sperberg-mcqueen on december james clark served technical lead working group notably contributing empty-element syntax name xml other names that had been put forward for consideration included magma minimal architecture for generalized markup applications slim structured language for internet markup mgml minimal generalized markup language co-editors specification were originally tim bray michael sperberg-mcqueen halfway through project bray accepted consulting engagement with netscape provoking vociferous protests from microsoft bray was temporarily asked resign editorship this led intense dispute working group eventually solved by appointment microsoft's jean paoli third co-editor xml working group never met face-to-face design was accomplished using combination email weekly teleconferences major design decisions were reached short burst intense work between august november when first working draft xml specification was published further design work continued through xml became w3c recommendation on

revisions since then without being given new version number currently its fifth edition published on november widely implemented still recommended for general use second xml was initially published on february same day xml third edition currently its second edition published on august contains features some contentious that are intended make xml easier use certain cases main changes are enable use line-ending characters used on ebcdic platforms use scripts characters absent from unicode xml not very widely implemented recommended for use only by those who need its unique features prior its fifth edition release xml differed from xml having stricter requirements for characters available for use element attribute names unique identifiers first four editions xml characters were exclusively enumerated using specific version unicode standard unicode unicode fifth edition substitutes mechanism xml which more future-proof but reduces redundancy approach taken fifth edition xml all editions xml that only certain characters are forbidden names everything else allowed accommodate suitable name characters future unicode versions fifth edition xml names may contain characters balinese cham phoenician scripts among many others added unicode since unicode almost any unicode code point can be used character data attribute values xml document even if character corresponding code point not defined current version unicode character data attribute values xml allows use more control characters than xml but for robustness most control characters introduced xml must be expressed numeric character references x7f through x9f which had been allowed xml are xml even required be expressed numeric character references among supported control characters xml are two line break codes that must be treated whitespace whitespace characters are only control codes that can be written directly there has been discussion xml although no organization has announced plans for work on such project xml-sw sw for skunkworks written by one original developers xml contains some proposals for what xml might look like elimination dtds from syntax integration namespaces xml base xml information set
