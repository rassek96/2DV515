atlas computer from wikipedia free encyclopedia   redirected from atlas computer manchester jump navigation search university manchester atlas january atlas computer was joint development between university manchester ferranti plessey first atlas installed at manchester university officially commissioned was one world's first supercomputers considered be most powerful computer world at that time was said that whenever atlas went offline half united kingdom's computer capacity was lost was second-generation machine using discrete germanium transistors two other atlas machines were built one for british petroleum university london one for atlas computer laboratory at chilton near oxford derivative system was built by ferranti for cambridge university called titan atlas had different memory organisation ran time-sharing operating system developed by cambridge university computer laboratory two further atlas 2s were delivered one cad centre cambridge later called cadcentre then aveva other atomic weapons research establishment awre aldermaston university manchester's atlas was decommissioned but last was service until parts chilton atlas are preserved by national museums scotland edinburgh main console itself was rediscovered july at rutherford appleton laboratory chilton near oxford cadcentre's atlas was decommissioned late contents background technical description o hardware o extracode o software see also notes references further reading external links background development muse—a name derived from microsecond engine—began at manchester university aim was build computer that could operate at processing speeds approaching one microsecond per instruction about one million instructions per second prefix micro- abbreviation µ si international system units denotes factor 10−6 one millionth at end ferranti agreed collaborate with manchester university on project computer was shortly afterwards renamed atlas with joint venture under control tom kilburn first atlas was officially commissioned on december was considered at that time be equivalent four ibm 7094s nearly fast ibm stretch then world's fastest supercomputer technical description hardware machine had many innovative features but key operating parameters were follows store size relates manchester installation others were larger 48-bit word size word could hold one floating-point number one instruction two 24-bit addresses signed integers eight 6-bit characters 24-bit million words million characters address space that embraced supervisor 'sacred' store v-store fixed store user store 16k words core store equivalent kb featuring interleaving odd/even addresses 96k words drum store eqv kb split across four drums but integrated with core store using virtual memory at that time referred 'one-level store' paging techniques large number more than high-speed index registers b-lines that could be used for address modification mostly double-modified instructions register address space also included special registers such extracode operand address exponent floating-point accumulator three control program counter registers supervisor control extracode control user control capability for addition for time sophisticated new peripherals such magnetic tape peripheral control through v-store addresses interrupts extracode routines associative memory content-addressable memory determine whether desired virtual memory location was core store instruction pipelining atlas did not use synchronous clocking mechanism—it was asynchronous processor—so performance measurements were not easy but example fixed-point register add – microseconds floating-point add no modification – microseconds floating-point add double modify – microseconds floating-point multiply double modify – microseconds extracode one feature atlas was extracode technique that allowed complex instructions be implemented software uppermost ten bits 48-bit atlas machine instruction denoted which operation should be performed if most significant bit was set zero this was ordinary machine instruction executed directly by hardware if uppermost bit was set one this was extracode was implemented special kind subroutine jump location fixed store rom its address being determined by other nine bits about extracodes were implemented possible extracode mode had its own program address counter easy access instruction operands extracodes were what would be called software interrupt trap today they were used call mathematical procedures which would have been too inefficient implement hardware for example sine logarithm square root but about half codes were designated supervisor functions which invoked operating system procedures typical examples would be “print specified character on specified stream” “read block words from logical tape n” extracodes were only means by which program could communicate with supervisor other uk machines era such ferranti orion had similar mechanisms for calling on services their operating systems software atlas pioneered many software concepts still common use today including atlas supervisor considered by many be first recognisable modern operating system one first high level languages available on atlas was named atlas autocode which was contemporary algol60 created specifically address what tony brooker perceived be some defects that language atlas did however support algol well fortran cobol being university machine was patronised by large number student population who had access protected machine code development
