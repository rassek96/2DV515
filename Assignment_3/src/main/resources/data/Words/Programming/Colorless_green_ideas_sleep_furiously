colorless green ideas sleep furiously sentence composed by noam chomsky his book syntactic structures example sentence that grammatically correct but semantically nonsensical sentence was originally used his thesis logical structures linguistic theory his paper three models for description language although sentence grammatically correct no obvious understandable meaning can be derived from thus demonstrates distinction between syntax semantics example category mistake was used show inadequacy then-popular probabilistic models grammar need for more structured models contents details attempts at meaningful interpretations statistical challenges related similar examples see also references details full passage says colorless green ideas sleep furiously furiously sleep ideas green colorless fair assume that neither sentence nor nor indeed any part these sentences has ever occurred english discourse hence any statistical model for grammaticalness these sentences will be ruled out on identical grounds equally remote from english yet though nonsensical grammatical while not grammatical while meaninglessness sentence often considered fundamental chomsky's point chomsky was only relying on sentences having never been spoken before thus even if one were prescribe likely reasonable meaning sentence grammaticality sentence concrete despite being first time person had ever uttered statement any part thereof such combination this was used then counter-example idea that human speech engine was based upon statistical models such markov chain simple statistics words following others attempts at meaningful interpretations sentence can be partially interpreted through polysemy both green colorless have figurative meanings which allow colorless be interpreted nondescript green either immature pertaining environmental consciousness sentence can therefore be construed nondescript immature ideas have violent nightmares phrase with less oblique semantics particular phrase can have legitimate meaning too if green understood mean newly formed sleep can be used figuratively express mental verbal dormancy furiously remains problematic when applied verb sleep since furiously denotes angrily violently intensely energetically meanings which are generally incompatible with sleep dormancy unconscious agents typically construed conscious ones eg animals humans which truly sleep writers have attempted provide sentence meaning through context first which was written by chinese linguist yuen ren chao literary competition was held at stanford university

within give us sudden awesome beauty spring flowering bulbs while winter reigns earth reposes but these colourless green ideas sleep furiously statistical challenges fernando pereira university pennsylvania has fitted simple statistical markov model body newspaper text shown that under this model furiously sleep ideas green colorless about times less probable than colorless green ideas sleep furiously this statistical model defines similarity metric whereby sentences which are more like those within corpus certain respects are assigned higher values than sentences less alike pereira's model assigns ungrammatical version same sentence lower probability than syntactically correct form demonstrating that statistical models can learn grammaticality distinctions with minimal linguistic assumptions however not clear that model assigns every ungrammatical sentence lower probability than every grammatical sentence that colorless green ideas sleep furiously may still be statistically more remote from english than some ungrammatical sentences this may be argued that no current theory grammar capable distinguishing all grammatical english sentences from ungrammatical ones related

sentences with correct grammatical structure but which certain words have been omitted humor game generation sentences which are grammatical but which are meaningless have absurd ambiguous meanings such 'loud sharks' game also tends generate humorous double entendres there are likely earlier examples such sentences possibly from philosophy language literature but not necessarily uncontroversial ones given that focus has been mostly on borderline cases for example followers logical positivism held that metaphysical ie not empirically verifiable statements are simply meaningless eg rudolf carnap wrote article where he argued that almost every sentence from heidegger was grammatically correct yet meaningless course some philosophers who were not logical positivists disagreed with this philosopher bertrand russell used sentence quadruplicity drinks procrastination his “an inquiry into meaning truth” from make similar point wv quine took issue with him on grounds that for sentence be false nothing more than for not be true since quadruplicity doesn't drink anything sentence simply false not meaningless sketch about linguistics british comedy duo fry laurie used nonsensical
