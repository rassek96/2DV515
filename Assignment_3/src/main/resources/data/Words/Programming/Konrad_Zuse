order merit federal republic germany computer history museum fellow award signature konrad zuse german june – december was german civil engineer inventor computer pioneer his greatest achievement was world's first programmable computer functional program-controlled turing-complete z3 became operational may thanks this machine its predecessors zuse has often been regarded inventor modern computer zuse was also noted for s2 computing machine considered first process control computer he founded one earliest computer businesses producing z4 which became world's first commercial computer from he designed first high-level programming language plankalkül zuse suggested concept computation-based universe his book rechnender raum calculating space much his early work was financed by his family commerce but after he was given resources by nazi german government due world war ii zuse's work went largely unnoticed united kingdom united states possibly his first documented influence on us company was ibm's option on his patents there replica z3 well original z4 deutsches museum munich deutsches technikmuseum berlin has exhibition devoted zuse displaying twelve his machines including

references sources external links pre-world war ii work z1 zuse z1 replica german museum technology berlin born berlin germany on june he moved with his family braunsberg east prussia where his father was postal clerk zuse attended collegium hosianum braunsberg family moved hoyerswerda where he passed his abitur qualifying him enter university he enrolled technische hochschule berlin now technical university berlin explored both engineering architecture but found them boring zuse then pursued civil engineering graduating for time he worked for ford motor company using his considerable artistic skills design advertisements he started work design engineer at henschel aircraft factory schönefeld near berlin this required performance many routine calculations by hand which he found mind-numbingly boring leading him dream doing them by machine beginning he experimented construction computers his parents' flat on wrangelstraße moving with them into their new flat on methfesselstraße street leading up kreuzberg berlin working his parents' apartment his first attempt called z1 was floating point binary mechanical calculator with limited programmability reading instructions from perforated mm film zuse submitted two patents that anticipated von neumann architecture he finished z1 z1 contained some metal parts never worked well due insufficient mechanical precision on january z1 its original blueprints were destroyed with his parents' flat many neighbouring buildings by british air raid world war ii between zuse recreated z1 suffering heart attack midway through project cost dm approximately $500000 required four individuals including zuse assemble funding for this retrocomputing project was provided by siemens consortium five companies z2 z3 z4 plaque commemorating zuse's work attached ruin methfesselstraße berlin zuse completed his work entirely independently other leading computer scientists mathematicians his day between he was near-total intellectual isolation zuse was called military service where he was given resources ultimately build z2 september zuse presented z2 covering several rooms parental flat experts deutsche versuchsanstalt für luftfahrt dvl ie german research institute for aviation z2 was revised version z1 using telephone relays dvl granted research subsidies so that zuse started company zuse apparatebau zuse apparatus construction manufacture his machines renting workshop on opposite side methfesselstraße stretching through block belle-alliance straße renamed renumbered mehringdamm improving on basic z2 machine he built z3 on may zuse presented z3 built his workshop public z3 was binary 22-bit floating point calculator featuring programmability with loops but without conditional jumps with memory calculation unit based on telephone relays telephone relays used his machines were largely collected from discarded stock despite absence conditional jumps z3 was turing complete computer however turing-completeness was never considered by zuse who had practical applications mind only demonstrated see history computing hardware z3 first fully operational electromechanical computer was partially financed by german government-supported dvl which wanted their extensive calculations automated request by his co-worker helmut schreyer—who had helped zuse build z3 prototype 1938—for government funding for electronic successor z3 was denied strategically unimportant statue zuse bad hersfeld schreyer had advised zuse use vacuum tubes switching elements zuse at this time considered crazy idea schnapsidee his own words zuse's workshop on methfesselstraße with z3 was destroyed allied air raid late parental flat with z1 z2 on january following year whereas successor z4 which zuse had begun constructing new premises industriehof on oranienstraße remained intact on february aerial bombing caused devastating destruction luisenstadt area around oranienstraße including neighbouring houses this event effectively brought zuse's research development complete halt partially finished relay-based z4 was packed moved from berlin on february only arriving göttingen two weeks later work on z4 could not be resumed immediately extreme privation post-war germany was not until that he was able resume work on he showed mathematician eduard stiefel swiss federal institute technology zurich eidgenössische technische hochschule eth zürich who ordered one on november zuse kg was founded z4 was delivered eth zurich on july proved very reliable s1 s2 german government began funding him through aerodynamische versuchsanstalt ava aerodynamic research institute forerunner dlr which used his work for production glide bombs zuse built s1 s2 computing machines which were special purpose devices which computed aerodynamic corrections wings radio-controlled flying bombs s2 featured integrated analog-to-digital converter under program control making first process-controlled computer these machines contributed henschel werke hs hs guided missiles developed by german military between which were precursors modern cruise missile circuit design s1 was predecessor zuse's z11 zuse believed that these machines had been captured by occupying soviet troops plankalkül main article plankalkül while working on his z4 computer zuse realised that programming machine code was too complicated he started working on phd thesis containing groundbreaking research years ahead its time mainly first high-level programming language plankalkül plan calculus elaborate example program first real computer chess engine after luisenstadt bombing he flew from berlin for rural allgäu unable do any hardware development he continued working on plankalkül eventually publishing some brief excerpts his thesis work its entirety however remained unpublished until phd thesis was submitted at university augsburg but rejected for formal reasons because zuse forgot pay mark university enrollment fee rejection did not bother him plankalkül slightly influenced design algol but was itself only implemented dissertation by joachim hohmann heinz rutishauser one inventors algol wrote very first attempt devise algorithmic language was undertaken by k zuse his notation was quite general but proposal never attained consideration deserved further implementations followed then by team from free university berlin donald knuth suggested thought experiment what might have happened had bombing not taken place had phd thesis accordingly been published planned zuse memorial hünfeld hessen personal life konrad zuse married gisela brandes january employing carriage himself dressed tailcoat top hat with gisela wedding veil for zuse attached importance noble ceremony their son horst first five children was born november while zuse never became member nazi party he not known have expressed any doubts qualms about working for nazi war effort much later he suggested that modern times best scientists engineers usually have choose between either doing their work for more less questionable business military interests faustian bargain not pursuing their
