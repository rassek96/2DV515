corporation cdc designed by seymour cray these used innovative designs parallelism achieve superior computational peak performance atlas was joint venture between ferranti manchester university was designed operate at processing speeds approaching one microsecond per instruction about one million instructions per second first atlas was officially commissioned on december one world's first supercomputers – considered be most powerful computer world at that time by considerable margin equivalent four ibm 7094s for cdc which cray designed released switch from using germanium silicon transistors was implemented they could run very fast solving overheating problem by introducing refrigeration helped make be fastest world given that outperformed all other contemporary computers by about times was dubbed supercomputer defined supercomputing market when one hundred computers were sold at $8 million each cray left cdc form his own company cray research four years after leaving cdc cray delivered mhz cray became one most successful supercomputers history cray-2 released was processor liquid cooled computer fluorinert was pumped through operated performed at gigaflops was world's second fastest after m-13 supercomputer moscow while supercomputers 1980s used only few processors 1990s machines with thousands processors began appear both united states japan setting new computational performance records fujitsu's numerical wind tunnel supercomputer used vector processors gain top spot with peak speed gigaflops gflops per processor hitachi sr2201 obtained peak

supercomputer architecture parallel computer hardware blue gene/l cabinet showing stacked blades each holding many processors approaches supercomputer architecture have taken dramatic turns since earliest systems were introduced 1960s early supercomputer architectures pioneered by seymour cray relied on compact innovative designs local parallelism achieve superior computational peak

however other systems such k computer continue use conventional processors such sparc-based designs overall applicability gpgpus general-purpose high-performance computing applications has been subject debate that while gpgpu may be tuned score well on specific benchmarks its overall applicability everyday algorithms may be limited unless significant effort spent tune application towards however gpus are gaining ground jaguar supercomputer was transformed into titan by retrofitting cpus with gpus high performance computers have expected life cycle about three years number special-purpose systems have been designed dedicated single problem this allows use specially programmed fpga chips even custom vlsi chips allowing better price/performance ratios by sacrificing generality examples special-purpose supercomputers include belle deep blue hydra for playing chess gravity pipe for astrophysics mdgrape-3 for protein structure computation molecular dynamics deep

cooling for example tianhe-1a consumes megawatts mw electricity cost power cool system can be significant eg mw at $010/kwh $400 hour about $35 million per year ibm hs20 blade heat management major issue complex electronic devices affects powerful computer systems various ways thermal design power cpu power dissipation issues supercomputing surpass those traditional computer cooling technologies supercomputing awards for green computing reflect this issue packing thousands processors together inevitably generates significant amounts heat density that need be dealt with cray was liquid cooled

processors system x special cooling system that combined air conditioning with liquid cooling was developed conjunction with liebert company blue gene system ibm deliberately used low power processors

by blue gene machines new york one achieving mflops/w with degima cluster nagasaki placing third with mflops/w because copper wires can transfer energy into supercomputer with much higher power densities than forced air circulating refrigerants can remove waste heat ability cooling systems remove waste heat limiting factor many existing supercomputers have more infrastructure capacity than actual peak demand machine – designers generally conservatively design power cooling infrastructure handle more than theoretical peak electrical power consumed by supercomputer designs for future supercomputers are power-limited – thermal design power supercomputer whole amount that power cooling infrastructure can handle somewhat more than expected normal power consumption but less than theoretical peak power consumption electronic hardware software system management operating systems main article supercomputer operating systems since end 20th century supercomputer operating systems have undergone major transformations based on changes supercomputer architecture while early operating systems were custom tailored each supercomputer gain speed trend has been move away from in-house operating systems adaptation generic software such linux since modern massively parallel supercomputers typically separate computations from other services by using multiple types nodes they usually run different operating systems on different nodes eg using small efficient lightweight kernel such cnk cnl on compute nodes but larger system such linux-derivative on server i/o nodes while traditional multi-user computer system job scheduling effect tasking problem for processing peripheral resources massively parallel system job management system needs manage allocation both computational communication resources well gracefully deal with inevitable hardware failures when tens thousands processors are present although most modern supercomputers use linux operating system
