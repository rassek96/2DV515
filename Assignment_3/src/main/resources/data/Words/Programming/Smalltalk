number smalltalk variants unqualified word smalltalk often used indicate smalltalk-80 language first version be made publicly available created smalltalk was product research led by alan kay at xerox palo alto research center parc alan kay designed most early smalltalk versions which dan ingalls implemented first version known smalltalk-71 was created by kay few mornings on bet that programming language based on idea message passing inspired by simula could be implemented page code later variant actually used for research work now known smalltalk-72 influenced development actor model its syntax execution model were very different from modern smalltalk variants after significant revisions which froze some aspects execution semantics gain performance by adopting simula-like class inheritance model execution smalltalk-76 was created this system had development environment featuring most now familiar tools including class library code browser/editor smalltalk-80 added metaclasses help maintain everything object except private instance variables paradigm by associating properties behavior with individual classes even primitives such integer boolean values for example support different ways creating instances smalltalk-80 was first language variant made available outside parc first smalltalk-80 version given small number firms hewlett-packard apple computer tektronix dec universities uc berkeley for peer review implementation on their platforms later general availability implementation known smalltalk-80 version was released image platform-independent file with object definitions virtual machine specification ansi smalltalk has been standard language reference since two currently popular smalltalk implementation variants are descendants those original smalltalk-80 images squeak open source implementation derived from smalltalk-80 version by way apple smalltalk visualworks derived from smalltalk-80 version by way smalltalk-80 objectworks both products parcplace systems xerox parc spin-off company formed bring smalltalk market interesting link between generations vassili bykov implemented hobbes virtual machine running smalltalk-80 inside visualworks dan ingalls later ported hobbes squeak during late 1980s mid-1990s smalltalk environments—including support training add-ons—were sold by two competing organizations parcplace systems digitalk both california based parcplace systems tended focus on unix/sun microsystems market while digitalk focused on intel-based pcs running microsoft windows ibm's os/2 both firms struggled take smalltalk mainstream due smalltalk's substantial memory needs limited run-time performance initial lack supported connectivity sql-based relational database servers while high price parcplace smalltalk limited its market penetration mid-sized large commercial organizations digitalk products initially tried reach wider audience with lower price ibm initially supported digitalk product but then entered market with smalltalk product called visualage/smalltalk easel introduced enfin at this time on windows os/2 enfin became far more popular europe ibm introduced into shops before their development ibm smalltalk later visualage enfin was later acquired by cincom systems now sold under name objectstudio part cincom smalltalk product suite parcplace digitalk merged into parcplace-digitalk then rebranded objectshare located irvine ca objectshare nasdaq objs was traded publicly until when was delisted dissolved merged firm never managed find effective response java market positioning by its owners were looking sell business seagull software acquired objectshare java development lab including original smalltalk/v visual smalltalk development team still owns visualsmalltalk although worldwide distribution rights for smalltalk product remained with objectshare who then sold them cincom visualworks was sold cincom now part cincom smalltalk cincom has backed smalltalk strongly releasing multiple new versions visualworks objectstudio each year since cincom gemstone object arts plus other vendors continue sell smalltalk environments ibm has 'end life'd visualage smalltalk having late 1990s decided back java supported by instantiations inc which has renamed product va smalltalk released several new versions open squeak implementation has active community developers including many original smalltalk community has recently been used provide etoys environment on olpc project toolkit for developing collaborative applications croquet project open cobalt virtual world application gnu smalltalk free software implementation derivative smalltalk-80 from gnu project pharo smalltalk fork squeak oriented towards research use commercial environments significant development that has spread across all current smalltalk environments increasing usage two web frameworks seaside aida/web simplify building complex web applications seaside has seen considerable market interest with cincom gemstone instantiations incorporating extending influences smalltalk was one many object-oriented programming languages based on simula smalltalk was also one most influential programming languages virtually all object-oriented languages that came after— flavors clos objective-c java python ruby many others—were influenced by smalltalk smalltalk was also one most popular languages with agile methods rapid prototyping software patterns communities highly productive environment provided by smalltalk platforms made them ideal for rapid iterative development smalltalk emerged from larger program arpa funded research that many ways defined modern world computing addition smalltalk working prototypes things such hypertext guis multimedia mouse telepresence internet were developed by arpa researchers 1960s alan kay one inventors smalltalk also described tablet computer he called dynabook which resembles modern tablet computers like ipad smalltalk environments were often first develop what are now common object-oriented software design patterns one most popular model–view–controller pattern for user interface design mvc pattern enables developers have multiple consistent views same underlying data it's ideal for software development environments where there are various views eg entity-relation dataflow object model etc same underlying specification also for simulations games where underlying model may be viewed from various angles levels abstraction addition mvc pattern smalltalk language environment were tremendously influential history graphical user interface gui what you see what you get wysiwyg user interface font editors desktop metaphors for ui design powerful built-in debugging object inspection tools that came with smalltalk environments set standard for all integrated development environments starting with lisp machine environments that came after object-oriented programming main article object-oriented programming other object-oriented languages central concept smalltalk-80 but not smalltalk-72 that object object always instance class classes are blueprints that describe properties behavior their instances for example gui's window class might declare that windows have properties such label position whether window visible not class might also declare that instances support operations such opening closing moving hiding each particular window object would have its own values those properties each them would be able perform operations defined by its class smalltalk object can do exactly three things hold state references other objects receive message from itself another object course processing message send messages itself another object state object holds always private that object other objects can query change that state only by sending requests messages object do so any message can be sent any object when message received receiver determines whether that message appropriate alan kay has commented that despite attention given objects messaging most important concept smalltalk big idea 'messaging'—that what kernel smalltalk/squeak all about it's something that was never quite completed our xerox parc phase smalltalk pure object-oriented programming language meaning that unlike java c++ there no difference between values which are objects values which are primitive types smalltalk primitive values such integers booleans characters are also objects sense that they are instances corresponding classes operations on them are invoked by sending messages programmer can change extend through subclassing classes that implement primitive values so that new behavior can be defined for their instances—for example implement new control structures—or even so that their existing behavior will be changed this fact summarized commonly heard phrase smalltalk everything object which may be more accurately expressed all values are objects variables are not since all values are objects classes themselves are also objects each class instance metaclass that class metaclasses turn are also objects are all instances class called metaclass code blocks—smalltalk's way expressing anonymous functions—are also objects reflection reflection term that computer scientists apply software programs that have capability inspect their own structure for example their parse tree datatypes input output parameters reflection was first primarily feature interpreted languages such smalltalk lisp fact that statements are interpreted means that programs have access information created they were parsed can often even modify their own structure reflection also feature having meta-model smalltalk does meta-model model that describes language itself developers can use meta-model do things like walk through examine modify parse tree object find all instances certain kind structure eg all instances method class meta-model smalltalk-80 totally reflective system implemented smalltalk-80 itself smalltalk-80 provides both structural computational reflection smalltalk structurally reflective system whose structure defined by smalltalk-80 objects classes methods that define system are themselves objects fully part system that they help define smalltalk compiler compiles textual source code into method objects typically instances compiledmethod these get added classes by storing them class's method dictionary part class hierarchy that defines classes can add new classes system system extended by running smalltalk-80 code that creates defines classes methods this way smalltalk-80 system living system carrying around ability extend itself at run time since classes are themselves objects they can be asked questions such what methods do you implement what fields/slots/instance variables do you define so objects can easily be inspected copied de serialized so on with generic code that applies any object system smalltalk-80 also provides computational reflection ability observe computational state system languages derived from original smalltalk-80 current activation method accessible object named via pseudo-variable one six reserved words thiscontext by sending messages thiscontext method activation can ask questions like who sent this message me these facilities make possible implement co-routines prolog-like back-tracking without modifying virtual machine exception system implemented using this facility one more interesting uses this seaside web framework which relieves programmer dealing with complexity web browser's back button by storing continuations for each edited page switching between them user navigates web site programming web server using seaside can then be done using more conventional programming style example how smalltalk can use reflection mechanism for handling errors when object sent message that does not implement virtual machine sends object doesnotunderstand message with reification message argument message another object instance message contains selector message array its arguments interactive smalltalk system default implementation doesnotunderstand one that opens error window notifier reporting error user through this reflective facilities user can examine context which error occurred redefine offending code continue all within system using smalltalk-80's reflective facilities syntax this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged removed june learn how when remove this template message smalltalk-80 syntax rather minimalist based on only handful declarations reserved words fact only six keywords are reserved smalltalk true false nil self super thiscontext these are actually called pseudo-variables identifiers that follow rules for variable identifiers but denote bindings that programmer cannot change true false nil pseudo-variables are singleton instances self super refer receiver message within method activated response that message but sends super are looked up superclass method's defining class rather than class receiver which allows methods subclasses invoke methods same name superclasses thiscontext refers current activation record only built-in language constructs are message sends assignment method return literal syntax for some objects from its origins language for children all ages standard smalltalk syntax uses punctuation manner more like english than mainstream coding languages remainder language including control structures for conditional evaluation iteration implemented on top built-in constructs by standard smalltalk class library for performance reasons implementations may recognize treat special some those messages however this only optimization not hardwired into language syntax adage that smalltalk syntax fits on postcard refers code snippet by ralph johnson demonstrating all basic standard syntactic elements methods examplewithnumber x | y | true & false not & nil isnil iffalse y = self size + super size $a do ^x message > sent with argument answer which will be false notice that smalltalk-80 language itself does not imply meaning those operators outcome above only defined by how receiver message this case number instance responds messages + > side effect this mechanism operator overloading message > can also be understood by other objects allowing use expressions form > b compare them expressions expression can include multiple message sends this case expressions are parsed according simple order precedence unary messages have highest precedence followed by binary messages followed by keyword messages for example factorial + factorial between evaluated follows receives message factorial answers receives message factorial answers receives message + with argument answers receives message betweenand with arguments answers true answer last message sent result entire expression parentheses can alter order evaluation when needed for example factorial + factorial between will change meaning so that expression first computes factorial + yielding that then receives second factorial message yielding then receives betweenand answering false note that because meaning binary messages not hardwired into smalltalk-80 syntax all them are considered have equal precedence are evaluated simply from left right because this meaning smalltalk expressions using binary messages can be different from their traditional interpretation + evaluated + producing obtain expected answer parentheses must be used explicitly define order operations + unary messages can be chained by writing them one after another factorial factorial log which sends factorial then factorial result then log result producing result series expressions can be written following hypothetical example each separated by period this example first creates new instance class window stores variable then sends two messages | window | window = window new window label 'hello' window open if series messages are sent same receiver example above they can also be written cascade with individual messages separated by semicolons window new label 'hello' open this rewrite earlier example single expression avoids need store new window temporary variable according usual precedence rules unary message new sent first then label open are sent answer new code blocks block code anonymous function can be expressed literal value which object since all values are objects this achieved with square brackets where params list parameters code can take this means that smalltalk code can be understood f {\displaystyle f} f x = x + {\displaystyle fx=x+1} expressed lambda terms λ x {\displaystyle \lambda x} x + {\displaystyle x+1} value can be evaluated f = + {\displaystyle f3=3+1} lambda terms λ x x + β → {\displaystyle \lambda xx+13{\beta }\rightarrow 4} resulting block object can form closure can access variables its enclosing lexical scopes at any time blocks are first-class objects blocks can be executed by sending them value message compound variations exist order provide parameters block eg 'valuevalue' 'valuewitharguments' literal representation blocks was innovation which on one hand allowed certain code be significantly more readable allowed algorithms involving iteration be coded clear concise way code that would typically be written with loops some languages can be written concisely smalltalk using blocks sometimes single line but more importantly blocks allow control structure be expressed using messages polymorphism since blocks defer computation polymorphism can be used select alternatives so if-then-else smalltalk written implemented expr iftrue iffalse true methods for evaluation iftrue truealternativeblock iffalse falsealternativeblock ^truealternativeblock value false methods for evaluation iftrue truealternativeblock iffalse falsealternativeblock ^falsealternativeblock value positiveamounts = allamounts select note that this related functional programming wherein patterns computation here selection are abstracted into higher-order functions for example message select on collection equivalent higher-order function filter on appropriate functor control structures control structures do not have special syntax smalltalk they are instead implemented messages sent objects for example conditional execution implemented by sending message iftrue boolean object passing argument block code be executed if only if boolean receiver true following code demonstrates this result = > b iftrue iffalse blocks are also used implement user-defined control structures enumerators visitors pluggable behavior many other patterns for example | astring vowels | astring = 'this string' vowels = astring select last line string sent message select with argument that code block literal code block literal will be used predicate function that should answer true if only if element string should be included collection characters that satisfy test represented by code block that argument select message string object responds select message by iterating through its members by sending itself message do evaluating selection block ablock once with each character contains argument when evaluated by being sent message value each selection block referenced by parameter ablock defined by block literal answers boolean which then sent iftrue if boolean object true character added string be returned because select method defined abstract class collection can also be used like this | rectangles apoint collisions | rectangles = orderedcollection with rectangle left right top bottom with rectangle left right top bottom apoint = point x y collisions = rectangles select classes this stock class definition object subclass messagepublisher instancevariablenames '' classvariablenames '' pooldictionaries '' category 'smalltalk examples' often most this definition will be filled by environment notice that this actually message object-class create subclass called messagepublisher other words classes are first-class objects smalltalk which can receive messages just like any other object can be created dynamically at execution time methods when object receives message method matching message name invoked following code defines method publish so defines what will happen when this object receives 'publish' message publish transcript show 'hello world' following method demonstrates receiving multiple arguments returning value quadmultiply i1 i2 this method multiplies given numbers by each other result by | mul | mul = i1 i2 ^mul method's name quadmultiplyand return value specified with operator note that objects are responsible for determining dynamically at runtime which method execute response message—while many languages this may be sometimes even always determined statically at compile time instantiating classes following code messagepublisher new creates returns new instance messagepublisher class this typically assigned variable publisher = messagepublisher new however also possible send message temporary anonymous object messagepublisher new publish hello world example hello world program used by virtually all texts new programming languages first program learned show most basic syntax environment language for smalltalk program extremely simple write following code message show sent object transcript with string literal 'hello world' its argument invocation show method causes characters its argument string literal 'hello world' be displayed transcript terminal window transcript show 'hello world' note that transcript window would need be open order see results this example image-based persistence most popular programming systems separate static program code form class definitions functions procedures from dynamic run time program state such objects other forms program data they load program code when program starts any prior program state must be recreated explicitly from configuration files other data sources any settings program programmer does not explicitly save must be set up again for each restart traditional program also loses much useful document information each time program saves file quits reloads this loses details such undo history cursor position image based systems don't force losing all that just because computer turned off os updates many smalltalk systems however do not differentiate between program data objects code classes fact classes are objects themselves therefore most smalltalk systems store entire program state including both class non-class objects image file image can then be loaded by smalltalk virtual machine restore smalltalk-like system prior state this was inspired by flex language created by alan kay described his msc thesis smalltalk images are similar restartable core dumps can provide same functionality core dumps such delayed remote debugging with full access program state at time error other languages that model application code form data such lisp often use image-based persistence well this method persistence powerful for rapid development because all development information eg parse trees program saved which facilitates debugging however also has serious drawbacks true persistence mechanism for one thing developers may often want hide implementation details not make them available run time environment for legal reasons well for maintenance reasons allowing anyone modify program at run time inevitably introduces complexity potential errors that would not be possible with compiled system that does not expose source code run time environment also while persistence mechanism easy use lacks true persistence capabilities needed for most multi-user systems most obvious ability do transactions with multiple users accessing same database parallel level access everything smalltalk-80 available for modification from within running program this means that for example ide can be changed running system without restarting some implementations syntax language garbage collection implementation can also be changed on fly even statement true become false valid smalltalk although executing not recommended when used judiciously this level flexibility allows for one shortest required times for new code enter production system just-in-time compilation main article just-in-time compilation smalltalk programs are usually
