reaction blinkenlights front panel front panel was used on early electronic computers display allow alteration state machine's internal registers memory front panel usually consisted arrays indicator lamps toggle switches push buttons mounted on sheet metal face plate early machines crts might also be present oscilloscope for example mirror contents williams-kilburn tube memory prior development crt system consoles many computers such ibm had console typewriters usually contents one more hardware registers would be represented by row lights allowing contents be read directly when machine was stopped switches allowed direct entry data address values into registers memory contents details common usage o booting o debugging o entertainment example references details on some machines certain lights switches were reserved for use under program control these were often referred sense lights sense switches for example original fortran compiler for ibm contained specific statements for testing manipulation 704's sense lights switches these switches were often used by program control optional behavior for example information might be printed only if particular sense switch was set operating systems made for computers with blinkenlights for example rsts/e rsx-11 would frequently have idle task blink panel lights some recognizable fashion system programmers often became very familiar with these light patterns could tell from them how busy system was sometimes exactly what was doing at moment master control program for burroughs corporation b6700 mainframe would display large block-letter b when system was idle switches lights required little additional logic circuitry usually no software support important when logic hardware components were costly software often limited this baroque style front panels began die out when seymour cray designed his cdc supercomputer with very simple elegant display console containing only crt displays keyboard replacing all hundreds switches buttons blinking lights had support from ten supporting peripheral processors whose duties included reading keyboard driving graphics displays early microcomputers such altair also relied on front panels but since introduction apple ii june vast majority micros came with keyboards connections for tv screens other monitors common usage operator would use front panel bootstrap computer debug running programs find hardware faults booting typically operator would have written procedure containing short series bootstrap instructions that would be hand-entered using toggle switches first operator would set address switch enter address binary using switches for easier entry readout on some computers such dec pdp-8 mits altair binary digits were grouped into threes on front panel with each group lights switches representing single octal digit between decimal computers like ibm used binary-coded decimal for memory addresses next operator would set value switch then enter value intended for that address after entering several these instructions most computers had deposit next button which would deposit subsequent values subsequent addresses relieving operator needing toggle addresses operator would then set starting address bootstrap program press run switch begin execution program bootstrap program usually read somewhat longer program from punched paper-tape punched cards magnetic tape disk which turn would load operating system from disk some machines accelerated bootstrap process by allowing operator set switches contain one two machine language instructions then directly executing those instructions other machines allowed i/o devices be explicitly commanded from front panel for example read-in preset on pdp-10 accessing memory-mapped i/o devices on pdp-11 some machines also contained various bootstrap programs rom all that was required boot system was start executing at address correct rom program debugging front panels were often used debug programs when operating support was limited most programs were run stand-alone mode typically front-panel switch could cause computer single-step that run single instruction stop until programmer pressed button execute next instruction address stop could be set stop running program when attempted execute instruction access data at specified address contents registers memory would be displayed front-panel lights programmer could read alter register contents change program instructions data memory force branch another section code when multiprogramming became norm was no longer acceptable tie up entire machine for debugging except for special situations programs called debuggers were written which provided programmer with equivalent front-panel functions wihout requiring entire machine entertainment for fun bored programmers would create programs display animated light shows front panels late 1960s early 1970s were quite brightly colored when bootstrap roms enabled computers start themselves without operator intervention late 1970s early 1980s most computers were built without front switch panel high-powered calculators such hp based on rom were among first computers do away with front panels operators huge banks blinkenlights blowenfuzen were featured on tv movies popular image computer during 1950s burroughs b205 was used hollywood prop for many these shows example pdp-8/e front panel following procedure would bootstrap pdp-8 system from rk05 moving-head magnetic disk ensure that machine halted by lowering raising halt switch front panel run light should then be off set data switches octal address depress load address addr load switch address lights will change set switches raise deposit switch data lights will show this instruction set switches raise deposit switch data lights will show this instruction set switches octal address depress load address switch address lights will change back depress clear switch depress continue switch run light will illuminate operating system on disk will be bootstrapped this process works by depositing simple two-instruction program memory executing first instruction commands disk controller begin reading disk from current disk address into current memory address second instruction jmp instruction that jumps itself endlessly when clear pressed disk controller's current disk address set sector its current memory address set memory location when read commanded program stored disk sector overlays bootstrap program once jmp instruction overlaid disk program
