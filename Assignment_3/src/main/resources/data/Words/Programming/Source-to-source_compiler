source-to-source compiler transcompiler transpiler type compiler that takes source code program written one programming language its input produces equivalent source code another programming language source-to-source compiler translates between programming languages that operate at approximately same level abstraction while traditional compiler translates from higher level programming language lower level programming language for example source-to-source compiler may perform translation program from pascal c automatic parallelizing compiler will frequently take high level language program input then transform code annotate with parallel code annotations eg openmp language constructs eg fortran's forall statements another purpose source-to-source-compiling translating legacy code use next version underlying programming language api that breaks backward compatibility will perform automatic code refactoring which useful when programs refactor are outside control original implementer for example converting programs from python python converting programs from old api new api when size program makes impractical time consuming refactor by hand transcompilers may either keep translated code close source code possible ease development debugging original source code may change structure original code so much that translated code does not look like source code there are also debugging utilities that map transpiled source code back original code for example javascript source maps allow mapping javascript code executed by web browser back original source transpiled-to-javascript language examples transcompiled languages include closure compiler coccinelle coffeescript dart haxe typescript emscripten contents history programming language implementations porting codebase transcompiler pipelines see also references history one earliest programs this kind was digital research's xlt86 program written by gary kildall which translated asm source code for intel processor into a86 source code for intel using global data flow analysis on register usage translator would also optimize output for code size take care calling conventions so that cp/m-80 mp/m-80 programs could be ported cp/m-86 mp/m-86 platforms automatically xlt86 itself was written pl/i-80 was available for cp/m-80 platforms well for dec vms for vax 11/750 11/780 similar but much less sophisticated program was transcom written by tim paterson part 86-dos could translate some z80 assembly source code into asm source code for but supported only subset opcodes registers modes often still requiring significant manual correction rework afterwards also did not carry out any register jump optimizations programming language implementations first implementations some programming languages started transcompilers default implementation for some those languages are still transcompilers addition table below coffeescript maintainer provides list languages that

java xtend java porting codebase when developers want switch different language while retaining most existing codebase might be better use transcompiler compared rewriting whole software by hand this case code often needs manual correction because automated translation might not work all cases tool source language target language comments 2to3 script python python even though 2to3 does its best at automating translation process further manual corrections are often needed emscripten llvm bytecode ecmascript this allows running c/c++ codebases browser for example google web toolkit java program
