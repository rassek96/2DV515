visual programming language from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search implementation hello world program scratch programming language computing visual programming language vpl any programming language that lets users create programs by manipulating program elements graphically rather than by specifying them textually vpl allows programming with visual expressions spatial arrangements text graphic symbols used either elements syntax secondary notation for example many vpls known dataflow diagrammatic programming are based on idea boxes arrows where boxes other screen objects are treated entities connected by arrows lines arcs which represent relations contents definition visual languages o educational o multimedia o video games o systems / simulation o automation o data warehousing/ business intelligence o miscellaneous o legacy visual styles see also references external links definition vpls may be further classified according type extent visual expression used into icon-based languages form-based languages diagram languages visual programming environments provide graphical iconic elements which can be manipulated by users interactive way according some specific spatial grammar for program construction visually transformed language non-visual language with superimposed visual representation naturally visual languages have inherent visual expression for which there no obvious textual equivalent current developments try integrate visual programming approach with dataflow programming languages either have immediate access program state resulting online debugging automatic program generation documentation dataflow languages also allow automatic parallelization which likely become one greatest programming challenges future instructive counterexample for visual programming languages microsoft visual studio languages encompasses visual basic visual c visual j etc are commonly confused with but are not visual programming languages all these languages are textual not graphical ms visual studio visual programming environment but not visual programming language hence confusion visual languages this dynamic list may never be able satisfy particular standards for completeness you can help by expanding with reliably sourced entries following contains list visual programming languages educational agentsheets easy use game authoring computational science authoring tool alice app inventor for android tool for creating applications for google android based on blockly kawa etoys scripting flowgorithm creates executable flowcharts which can be converted several languages hopscotch visual programming language for mobile touchscreen devices available on ipad kodu visual programming tool which builds on ideas begun with logo larp creates executable flowcharts for windows platform open roberta online programming environment from fraunhofer iais designed for kids raptor creates executable flowcharts scratch product mit designed for kids k-12 after school programs snap extension scratch with first class procedures lists which used for teaching by uc berkeley browser-based reimplementation byob programming language stagecast creator formerly apple's cocoa internet authoring for kids starlogo agent-based simulation language developed by mitchel resnick eric klopfer others at mit media lab extension logo programming language dialect lisp toontalk programming system for children visual logic creates executable flowcharts multimedia audiomulch audio signal flow based sound music creation environment blender software open source graphics package includes node editor create shading programs graphs also custom nodes allows create systems sverchok blendgraph other cameleon graphical functional language clickteam's games factory/multimedia fusion series environments made for visually developing games filter forge node based filter generation for image processing grasshopper generative modeling interface for rhinoceros kyma sound design language visual programming language for sound design used by musicians researchers sound designers mama software -
