contrast function-level probabilistic concept v t e computer programming dataflow programming programming paradigm that models program directed graph data flowing between operations thus implementing dataflow principles architecture dataflow programming languages share some features functional languages were generally developed order bring some functional concepts language more suitable for numeric processing some authors use term datastream instead dataflow avoid confusion with dataflow computing dataflow architecture based on indeterministic machine paradigm dataflow programming was pioneered by jack dennis his graduate students at mit 1960s contents properties dataflow programming languages o state o representation history languages application programming interfaces see also references external links properties dataflow programming languages traditionally program modeled series operations happening specific order this may be referred sequentialp3 procedural control flow indicating that program chooses specific path imperative programming program focuses on commands line with von neumannp3 vision sequential programming where data normally at restp7 contrast dataflow programming emphasizes movement data models programs series connections explicitly defined inputs outputs connect operations which function like black boxesp2 operation runs soon all its inputs become valid thus dataflow languages are inherently parallel can work well large decentralized systemsp3 state one key concepts computer programming idea state essentially snapshot various conditions system most programming languages require considerable amount state information which generally hidden from programmer often computer itself has no idea which piece information encodes enduring state this serious problem state information needs be shared across multiple processors parallel processing machines most languages force programmer add extra code indicate which data parts code are important state this code tends be both expensive terms performance well difficult read debug explicit parallelism one main reasons for poor performance enterprise java beans when building data-intensive non-oltp applications where linear program can be imagined single worker moving between tasks operations dataflow program more like series workers on assembly line each doing specific task whenever materials are available since operations are only concerned with availability data inputs they have no hidden state track are all ready at same time representation dataflow programs are represented different ways traditional program usually represented series text instructions which reasonable for describing serial system which pipes data between small single-purpose tools that receive process return dataflow programs start with input perhaps command line parameters illustrate how that data used modified flow data explicit often visually illustrated line pipe terms encoding dataflow program might be implemented hash table with uniquely identified inputs keys used look up pointers instructions when any operation completes program scans down list operations until finds first operation where all inputs are currently valid runs when that operation finishes will typically output data thereby making another operation become valid for parallel operation only list needs be shared state entire program thus task maintaining state removed from programmer given language's runtime on machines with single processor core where implementation designed for parallel operation would simply introduce overhead this overhead can be removed completely by using different runtime history pioneer dataflow language was blodi block diagram developed by john larry kelly jr carol lochbaum victor vyssotsky for specifying sampled data systems blodi specification functional units amplifiers adders delay lines etc their interconnections was compiled into single loop that updated entire system for one clock tick more conventional dataflow languages were originally developed order make parallel programming easier bert sutherland's phd thesis on-line graphical specification computer procedures sutherland created one first graphical dataflow programming frameworks subsequent dataflow languages were often developed at large supercomputer labs one most popular was sisal developed at lawrence livermore national laboratory sisal looks like most statement-driven languages but variables should be assigned once this allows compiler easily identify inputs outputs number offshoots sisal have been developed including sac single assignment c which tries remain close popular c programming language possible united states navy funded development acos spgn signal processing graph notation starting early 1980's this use on number platforms field today more radical concept prograph which programs are constructed graphs onscreen variables are replaced entirely with lines linking inputs outputs incidentally prograph was originally written on macintosh which remained single-processor until introduction daystar genesis mp there are many hardware architectures oriented toward efficient implementation dataflow programming models mit's tagged token dataflow architecture was designed by greg papadopoulos data flow has been proposed abstraction for specifying global behavior distributed
