intermediate language cil code into native system-dependent machine code with intention executing resulting binary file natively aot produces machine optimized code just like standard native compiler difference that aot transforms bytecode existing vm into machine code contents reduced runtime overhead performance trade-offs see also external links reduced runtime overhead some programming languages with managed code runtime that can be compiled intermediate language take advantage just-in-time jit this briefly compiles intermediate code into machine code for native run while intermediate code executing which may decrease application's performance ahead-of-time compilation eliminates need for this step by performing compilation before execution rather than during execution ahead-of-time compilation for dynamically typed languages native machine code other static vm bytecode possible only limited number cases for example hipe aot compiler for erlang can do this because advanced static type reconstruction techniques types speculations most situations with fully aot compiled programs libraries possible drop considerable fraction runtime environment thus saving disk space memory battery startup times no jit warmup phase etc because this can be useful embedded mobile devices performance trade-offs aot compilers can perform complex advanced code optimizations which most cases jiting will be considered much too costly on other hand aot usually cannot perform some optimizations possible jit like runtime profile-guided optimizations pseudo-constant propagation indirect/ virtual function inlining addition jit compilers can speculatively optimize hot code by making assumptions on code generated code can be deoptimized if speculative assumption later proves wrong such operation hurts performance running software until code optimized again by adaptive optimization aot compiler cannot make such assumptions needs infer much information possible at compile time needs resort less specialized code because cannot possibly know what actual types will go through method such problems can be alleviated by profile-guided optimizations but even this case generated code cannot be adapted dynamically actual changing runtime profile like jit compiler would do see also computer programming portal android runtime asmjs compiler javascript bartok cil
