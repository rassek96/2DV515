assembly language o basic o c o java-based o lisp-based o scala-based o smalltalk-based o other children historical university languages by age experience see also external links references learning paths many educational programming languages position themselves inside learning path that sequence languages each designed build on others moving student from easy understand entertaining environments full professional environments some better known are presented below assembly language originally machine code was first only way program computers assembly language was next type language used thus one oldest families computer languages use today many dialects implementations are available usually some for each computer processor architecture very basic termed low level programming language one more difficult languages work with being untyped rigid but this how computers work at low level several simplified dialects exist for education low level languages must be written for specific processor architecture cannot be written taught isolation without referencing processor for which was written unlike higher level languages using educational assembly language needs representation processor whether virtualized physical assembly most helpful language use for learning about fundamental computer processor operation little man computer lmc instructional model simple von neumann architecture computer with all basic features modern computers can be programmed machine code usually decimal assembly based on concept having little man locked small room at one end room are mailboxes memory each can hold three digit instruction data at other end room are two mailboxes labeled inbox outbox which receive emit data middle room work area with simple two function add subtract calculator called accumulator resettable counter called program counter counter similar what doorperson uses count how many people have entered facility can count up can be reset specified by von neumann architecture memory holds both instructions data user loads data into mailboxes then signals little man begin executing next byte codes nbc simple language with assembly language syntax that used program lego mindstorms nxt programmable bricks command line compiler emits nxt compatible machine code supports windows mac os x linux little computer lc-3 assembly language with simplified instruction set but can be used write moderately complex assembly programs theoretically viable target for c compilers simpler than x86 assembly but has many features similar those more complex languages these features make useful for teaching basic programming computer architecture beginning college computer science computer engineering students which its most common use dlx reduced instruction set computer risc processor architecture by main designers mips berkeley risc designs two benchmark examples risc design dlx essentially cleaned up simplified mips with simple 32-bit load/store architecture widely used college-level computer architecture courses mix mmix are hypothetical computers used donald knuth's monograph art computer programming taocp paraphrasing knuth mix systems are computers intended illustrate machine-level aspects programming so its machine language simple elegant easy learn also includes all complexities needed for high performance practice so principle can be built perhaps be competitive with some fast general-purpose computers mix hybrid programmable binary decimal numbers most programs written for will work using either form software implementations for mix mmix have been developed by knuth made freely available several versions both emulators exist mix 1960s-style computer superseded by mmix newer modern computer architecture 64-bit risc instruction set architecture isa for mmix knuth collaborated with architects mips alpha isas basic basic which stands for beginners all-purpose symbolic instruction code language invented provide computer access non-science students became popular on minicomputers during 1960s became standard computing language for microcomputers during late 1970s early 1980s goals basic were focused on needs learning program easily be easy for beginners use be interactive provide clear friendly error messages respond quickly do not require understanding computer hardware operating systems what made basic particularly useful for education was small size programs useful programs illustrate concept could be written dozen lines at same time basic did not require mathematical computer science sophistication basic continues this day be frequently self-taught with excellent tutorials implementations see list basic dialects by platform for complete list basic offers learning path from learning oriented basics such microsoft small basic basic-256 simple more full featured basics like visual basic net gambas visual basic net with freely available visual basic express edition including k-12 learning center beginner adult learning center microsoft small basic restricted version visual basic designed first language aimed at bringing 'fun' back programming language explicitly quite small with only intuitive keywords by including object specific libraries for things general interest children children can create entertaining interactive programs on net on desktop for example with lines code possible demonstrate random network image viewer using flickr source system utilizes microsoft visual studio ide provide autocompletion context sensitive help visual basic for applications vba version visual basic built into most microsoft office applications used build macros automate processes within most applications microsoft office eg creating user-defined function excel creating complex sequence commands response user event data entry form access vba can also work across applications like automatically creating report word from database access vba not used make standalone programs but works only within host application vba on every machine that has any part ms office installed so arguably most ubiquitously available version basic gambas which freely available easy use basic for linux with wikibook on gambas available basic-256 easy use version basic designed teach anybody basics computer programming uses traditional basic control structures gosub for loops goto for ease understanding program flow-control has built-in graphics mode that allows children draw pictures on screen after minutes includes tutorials that introduce programming concepts through fun exercises simple programming development system that was created provide easy programming abilities for everybody especially non-professionals somewhat like applesoft basic compiled lets users make their own libraries often-used functions simple generic term for three slightly different versions language micro-simple use only keywords pro-simple ultra-simple use keywords hot soup processor basic-derived language used japanese schools ti-basic simple basic-like language implemented texas instruments graphing calculators often serving students' first look at programming smallbasic fast easy learn basic language interpreter ideal for everyday calculations scripts prototypes includes trigonometric matrix algebra functions built ide powerful string library system sound graphic commands structured programming syntax c ch c/c++ interpreter designed help non-cs students learn math computing programming c c++ extends c with numerical 2d/3d graphical plotting scripting features java-based sun microsystems's recommended path greenfoot bluej netbeans-bluej netbeans-java greenfoot interactive java development environment developed primarily

developing all java application types java se web ejb mobile applications out box among other features are ant-based project system revision control code refactoring lisp-based lisp second oldest family programming languages use today such has many dialects implementations at wide range difficulties lisp was originally created practical mathematical notation for computer programs based on lambda calculus which makes particularly well suited for teaching theories computing one earliest languages lisp pioneered many ideas computer science including tree data structures automatic storage management dynamic typing object-oriented programming self-hosting compiler all which are useful for learning computer science name lisp derives from list processing language linked lists are one languages' major data structures lisp source code made lists thus lisp programs can manipulate source code data structure giving rise macro systems that allow programmers create new syntax even new domain-specific languages embedded lisp so lisps are useful for learning language design creating custom languages reasonable learning path would be logo followed by any educational variant such scheme newlisp followed by professional variant such common lisp logo language that was specifically designed introduce children programming first part learning logo deals with turtle graphics derived from turtle robots used early with proto-logo modern implementations abstract drawing device called turtle used make programming for children very attractive by concentrating on doing turtle graphics seymour papert inventor logo was major thinker constructionism variety constructivist learning theory papert argued that activities like writing would naturally be learned by much younger children providing that they adopted computing culture logo was thus designed not only teach programming computing concepts but enhance child's entire well being culture increasingly dominated by technology more important than having early start on intellectual building being saved from long period dependency during which one learns think learning something that has be dished out by more powerful othersuch children would not define themselves allow society define them intellectually helpless has been used with children young has track record years success education since logo actually streamlined version lisp with more advanced students can be used introduce basic concepts computer science even artificial intelligence brian harvey wrote series computer science logo style for self study computer science based on logo logo widely available on virtually every platform both free commercial versions scheme was originally designed serve tutorial purpose lisps day used non-recursive control structures implement lambda calculus primarily since lisps were still being implemented for efficiency reasons hardware guy l steele jr gerald jay sussman constructed scheme fast interpreted language atop underlying lisp with cheap procedure calls pedagogically this allowed for teaching programming terms domain-specific languages meta-circular evaluators publication structure interpretation computer programs incorporated this educational philosophy into canonical textbook which changed predominance pascal university programming language “ publication abelson sussman's structure interpretation computer programs sicp abelson et al revolutionized landscape introductory computing curriculum 1980s most importantly book liberated introductory course from tyranny syntax instead arranging course around syntax currently fashionable language sicp focused first course on study important ideas computing functional abstraction data abstraction streams data-directed programming implementation message-passing objects interpreters compilers register machines over short period many universities us around world switched their ﬁrst course sicp scheme book became major bestseller for mit press along with sicp scheme language became widely used was no longer subject few individual courses at indiana university mit yale but language choice introductory courses all over world ” since then scheme community has introduced several pedagogic programming environments for more modern approaches particular note racket outreach effort with its drracket environment freely available text how design programs programbydesign educator training first unit bootstrap curriculum uses racket language newlisp aims provide fast powerful cross-platform full-featured

late 1970s late 1980s was primary choice introductory computer science classes for teaching students programming both us europe its use for real-world applications has since increased regarding purely educational language has since become somewhat controversial university a++ represents more recent attempt create language designed provide efficient tool for basic training programming curry teaching language designed amalgamate most important declarative programming paradigms namely functional programming nested expressions higher-order functions lazy evaluation logic programming logical variables partial data structures built-in search also integrates two most import operational principles developed area integrated functional logic languages residuation narrowing haskell often used by universities instead lisp scheme its primary goal was function equally well language for teaching research application design purely functional extremely expressive lazy functional programming language sample courses are available online are multiple books tutorials education specific compiler / ide called helium has been created another advantage haskell teaching inductive methods because advantages haskell's syntax inductive proofs become easy easier they are on paper unlike lisp/scheme family which introduces additional syntax flowgorithm graphical authoring tool for writing executing programs via flowcharts approach designed emphasize algorithm rather than syntax given language flowchart can be converted several major languages such c java visual basic net python m2001 modular mathematical language for developing presenting mathematical algorithms from modern discrete classical continuous mathematics built on semantic framework based category theory with syntax
