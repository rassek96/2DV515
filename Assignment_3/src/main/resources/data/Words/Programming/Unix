multitasking multiuser computer operating systems that derive from original at&t unix developed 1970s at bell labs research center by ken thompson dennis ritchie others initially intended for use inside bell system at&t licensed unix outside parties from late 1970s leading variety both academic commercial variants unix from vendors such university california berkeley bsd microsoft xenix ibm aix sun microsystems solaris at&t finally sold its rights unix novell early 1990s which then sold its unix business santa cruz operation sco but unix trademark passed industry standards consortium open group which allows use mark for certified operating systems compliant with single unix specification sus among these apple's macos which unix version with largest installed base from power user's programmer's perspective unix systems are characterized by modular design that sometimes called unix philosophy meaning that operating system provides set simple tools that each perform limited well-defined function with unified filesystem main means communication shell scripting command language combine tools perform complex workflows aside from modular design unix also distinguishes itself from its predecessors first portable operating system almost entire operating system written c programming language that allowed unix reach numerous platforms many clones unix have arisen over years

variants o arpanet branding see also references further reading external links overview version unix research unix ancestor all modern unix systems unix was originally meant be convenient platform for programmers developing software be run on on other systems rather than for non-programmer users system grew larger operating system started spreading academic circles users added their own tools system shared them with colleagues unix was designed be portable multi-tasking multi-user time-sharing configuration unix systems are characterized by various concepts use plain text for storing data hierarchical file system treating devices certain types inter-process communication ipc files use large number software tools small programs that can be strung together through command-line interpreter using pipes opposed using single monolithic program that includes all same functionality these concepts are collectively known unix philosophy brian kernighan rob pike summarize this unix programming environment idea that power system comes more from relationships among programs than from programs themselves by early 1980s users began seeing unix potential universal operating system suitable for computers all sizes unix environment client–server program model were essential elements development internet reshaping computing centered networks rather than individual computers both unix c programming language were developed by at&t distributed government academic institutions which led both being ported wider variety machine families than any other operating system under unix operating system consists many utilities along with master control program kernel kernel provides services start stop programs handles file system other common low-level tasks that most programs share schedules access avoid conflicts when programs try access same resource device simultaneously mediate such access kernel has special rights reflected division between user space kernel space microkernel concept was introduced effort reverse trend towards larger kernels return system which most tasks were completed by smaller utilities era when standard computer consisted hard disk for storage data terminal for input output i/o unix file model worked quite well most i/o was linear however modern systems include networking other new devices graphical user interfaces developed file model proved inadequate task handling asynchronous events such those generated by mouse 1980s non-blocking i/o set inter-process communication mechanisms were augmented with unix domain sockets shared memory message queues semaphores microkernel implementations functions such network protocols could be moved out kernel while conventional monolithic unix implementations have network protocol stacks part kernel history main article history unix ken thompson sitting dennis ritchie working together at pdp-11 pre-history unix dates back mid-1960s when massachusetts institute technology bell labs general electric were developing innovative time-sharing operating system called multics for ge-645 mainframe multics introduced many innovations but had many problems frustrated by size complexity multics but not by aims bell labs slowly pulled out project their last researchers leave multics ken thompson dennis ritchie m d mcilroy j f ossanna decided redo work on much smaller scale name unics uniplexed information computing service pronounced eunuchs pun on multics multiplexed information computer services was initially suggested for project new operating system was emasculated multics peter h salus credits peter neumann with pun while brian kernighan claims coining for himself adds that no one can remember who came up with final spelling unix dennis ritchie also credits kernighan unix was rewritten c programming language migration from assembly higher-level language c resulted much more portable software requiring only relatively small amount machine-dependent code be replaced when porting unix other computing platforms bell labs produced several versions unix that are collectively referred research unix first source license for unix was sold faculty at university illinois department computer science uiuc graduate student greg chesson who had worked on unix kernel at bell labs was instrumental negotiating terms this license during late 1970s early 1980s influence unix academic circles led large-scale adoption unix bsd system v by commercial startups including sequent hp-ux solaris aix xenix late 1980s at&t unix system laboratories sun microsystems developed system v release svr4 which was subsequently adopted by many commercial unix vendors 1990s unix-like systems grew popularity linux bsd distributions were developed through collaboration by worldwide network programmers apple released darwin that became core macos operating system unix operating systems are widely used modern servers workstations mobile devices standards common desktop environment cde part cose initiative beginning late 1980s open operating system standardization effort now known posix provided common baseline for all operating systems ieee based posix around common structure major competing variants unix system publishing first posix standard early 1990s separate but very similar effort was started by industry consortium common open software environment cose initiative which eventually became single unix specification sus administered by open group starting open group ieee started austin group provide common definition posix single unix specification which by had become open group base specification effort towards compatibility several unix system vendors agreed on svr4's executable linkable format elf standard for binary object code files common format allows substantial binary compatibility among unix systems operating on same cpu architecture filesystem hierarchy standard was created provide reference directory layout for unix-like operating systems has mainly been used linux components see also list unix commands unix system composed several components that were originally packaged together by including development environment libraries documents portable modifiable source code for all these components addition kernel operating system unix was self-contained software system this was one key reasons emerged important teaching learning tool has had such broad influence inclusion these components did not make system large – original v7 unix distribution consisting copies all compiled binaries plus all source code documentation occupied less than mb arrived on single nine-track magnetic tape printed documentation typeset from on-line sources was contained two volumes names filesystem locations unix components have changed substantially across history system nonetheless v7 implementation considered by many have canonical early structure kernel – source code /usr/sys composed several sub-components o conf – configuration machine-dependent parts including boot code o dev – device drivers for control hardware some pseudo-hardware o sys – operating system kernel handling memory management process scheduling system calls etc o h – header files defining key structures within system important system-specific invariables development environment – early versions unix contained development environment sufficient recreate entire system from source code o cc – c language compiler first appeared v3 unix o – machine-language assembler for machine o ld – linker for combining object files o lib – object-code libraries installed /lib /usr/lib libc system library with c run-time support was primary library but there have always been additional libraries for such things mathematical functions libm database access v7 unix introduced first version modern standard i/o library stdio part system library later implementations increased number libraries significantly o make – build manager introduced pwb/unix for effectively automating build process o include – header files for software development defining standard interfaces system invariants o other languages – v7 unix contained fortran-77 compiler programmable arbitrary-precision calculator bc dc awk scripting language later versions implementations contain many other language compilers toolsets early bsd releases included pascal tools many modern unix systems also include gnu compiler collection well instead proprietary compiler system o other tools – including object-code archive manager ar symbol-table lister nm compiler-development tools eg lex & yacc debugging tools commands – unix makes little distinction between commands user-level programs for system operation maintenance eg cron commands general utility eg grep more general-purpose applications such text formatting typesetting package nonetheless some major categories are o sh – shell programmable command-line interpreter primary user interface on unix before window systems appeared even afterward within command window o utilities – core toolkit unix command set including cp ls grep find many others subcategories include + system utilities – administrative tools such mkfs fsck many others + user utilities – environment management tools such passwd kill others o document formatting – unix systems were used from outset for document preparation typesetting systems included many related programs such nroff troff tbl eqn refer pic some modern unix systems also include packages such tex ghostscript o graphics – plot subsystem provided facilities for producing simple vector plots device-independent format with device-specific interpreters display such files modern unix systems also generally include x11 standard windowing system gui many support opengl o communications – early unix systems contained no inter-system communication but did include inter-user communication programs mail write v7 introduced early inter-system communication system uucp systems beginning with bsd release 41c included tcp/ip utilities documentation – unix was first operating system include all its documentation online machine-readable form documentation included o man – manual pages for each command library component system call header file etc o doc – longer documents detailing major subsystems such c language troff impact see also unix-like this section

thompson dennis ritchie principal developers research unix photo from usenix including dennis ritchie center plan from bell labs extends unix design principles was developed successor unix unix system had significant impact on other operating systems achieved its reputation by its interactivity by providing software at nominal fee for educational use by running on inexpensive hardware by being easy adapt move different machines unix was originally written assembly language which had been thought necessary for system implementations on early computers but was soon rewritten c high-level programming language although this followed lead multics burroughs was unix that popularized idea unix had drastically simplified file model compared many contemporary operating systems treating all kinds files simple byte arrays file system hierarchy contained machine services devices such printers terminals disk drives providing uniform interface but at expense occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such ioctl mode flags access features hardware that did not fit simple stream bytes model plan operating system pushed this model even further eliminated need for additional mechanisms unix also popularized hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories originally introduced by multics other common operating systems era had ways divide storage device into multiple directories sections but they had fixed number levels often only one level several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after multics dec's rsx-11m's group user hierarchy evolved into vms directories cp/m's volumes evolved into ms-dos 20+ subdirectories hp's mpe groupaccount hierarchy ibm's ssp os/400 library systems were folded into broader posix file systems making command interpreter ordinary user-level program with additional commands provided separate programs was another multics innovation popularized by unix unix shell used same language for interactive commands for scripting shell scripts – there was no separate job control language like ibm's jcl since shell os commands were just another program user could choose even write his own shell new commands could be added without changing shell itself unix's innovative command-line syntax for creating modular chains producer-consumer processes pipelines made powerful programming paradigm coroutines widely available many later command-line interpreters have been inspired by unix shell fundamental simplifying assumption unix was its focus on newline- delimited text for nearly all file formats there were no binary editors original version unix – entire system was configured using textual shell command scripts common denominator i/o system was byte – unlike record-based file systems focus on text for representing nearly everything made unix pipes especially useful encouraged development simple general tools that could be easily combined perform more complicated ad hoc tasks focus on text bytes made system far more scalable portable than other systems over time text-based applications have also proven popular application areas such printing languages postscript odf at application layer internet protocols eg ftp smtp http soap sip unix popularized syntax for regular expressions that found widespread use unix programming interface became basis for widely implemented operating system interface standard posix see above c programming language soon spread beyond unix now ubiquitous systems applications programming early unix developers were important bringing concepts modularity reusability into software engineering practice spawning software tools movement over time leading developers unix programs that ran on established set cultural norms for developing software norms which became important influential technology unix itself this has been termed unix philosophy tcp/ip networking protocols were quickly implemented on unix versions widely used on relatively inexpensive computers which contributed internet explosion worldwide real-time connectivity which formed basis for implementations on many other platforms unix
