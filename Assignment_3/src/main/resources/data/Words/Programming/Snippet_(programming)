snippet programming from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search example code snippet snippet programming term for small region re-usable source code machine code text ordinarily these are formally defined operative units incorporate into larger programming modules snippet management feature some text editors program source code editors ides related software allows user avoid repetitive typing course routine edit operations contents overview o snippets text editors o snippets ides o snippets jit compilers definition example conventions snippet placeholders o placeholder identifiers o placeholder duplication o placeholder transformation snippet programming features o plain text o constants variables o interpreted code see also references examples code snippets overview snippet management text editor feature popular among software developers others who routinely require content from catalogue repeatedly entered text such with source code boilerplate often this feature justified because content varies only slightly not at all each time entered snippets text editors text editors that include this feature ordinarily provide mechanism manage catalogue separate snippets same manner that text editor operating system allow management separate files these basic management abilities include operations such viewing adding editing deleting sorting filtering grouping renaming storing snippets repository catalogue database some editors provide macro ability snippets allowing function prototypes variable control structures be generated based on standard template snippets ides some programmer's applications such eclipse netbeans microsoft's visual studio keyword tab ↹ other ides include built-in parts structure for ease coding other applications such macromedia dreamweaver make use these code snippets well for web development snippets jit compilers just-in-time jit compilers can splice together pre-compiled sections code longer object code/machine code segments this reduces interpret time significantly simultaneously speeds execution definition programming practice snippet refers narrowly portion source code that literally included by editor program into file form copy paste programming this concrete inclusion contrast abstraction methods such functions macros which are abstraction within language snippets are thus primarily used when these abstractions are not available not desired such languages that lack abstraction for clarity absence overhead snippets are similar having static preprocessing included editor do not require support by compiler on flip side this means that snippets cannot be invariably modified after fact thus vulnerable all problems copy paste programming for this reason snippets are primarily used for simple sections code with little logic for boilerplate such copyright notices function prototypes common control structures standard library imports example consider process swapping values two variables x y assuming weak typing not being concerned about name collision this represented by code temp = x x = y y = temp when snippet inserted programmer prompted for values two parameters assuming they are type foo bar which are actual names variables they wish swap this will yield code temp = foo foo = bar bar = temp if snippet subsequently changed say use temp instead temp will not change code that has already been inserted but will be used subsequent insertions snippet snippet for this might be represented temp = $1 $1 = $2 $2 = temp conventions addition basic management abilities described previously snippet management features can be classified according scope interactivity between snippets text editor application that hosts them these snippet feature groups include plain-text static snippets interactive dynamic snippets scriptable snippets static snippets consist primarily fixed text that user can choose insert into current document user not able specify anything else except perhaps cursor position relative newly inserted text static snippets are similar simple macros dynamic snippets consist fixed text combined with dynamic elements user may specify both content dynamic elements well their position relative fixed text part choosing what insert into current document examples dynamic elements could be variables such current date system time input from user that supplied via gui input from another application see also programmable macro scriptable snippets consist runnable segments code either macro language scripting language scriptable snippets provide greatest degree flexibility user although that depends somewhat on programming languages supported by text editor whether not programming language well-known particular unique that specific editor type scripting support varies but may include features such running shell commands providing gui dialog other methods user interaction with operating system other applications other sub-components hosting application itself snippet placeholders placeholders are elements within snippet that are left be supplied by user other external process values for placeholders are not determined until text snippet inserted during editing session placeholders may have special markup syntax that allows editor identify boundaries placeholders relative other text current edit buffer other applications employ graphical user interfaces modal dialog boxes that allow user enter one more values be supplied for placeholders placeholder identifiers placeholders are usually indicated by some special character sequence characters distinguish them from rest snippet text some systems allow snippet placeholders be named identifiers identifiers may be useful for supporting such features placeholder duplication placeholder transformation following example uses identifiers firstname lastname item hello {%firstname%} {%lastname%} your shipment {%item%} now ready pick up thanks {%firstname%} placeholder duplication this allows user indicate that value supplied for one placeholder should be replicated multiple places relative entire text programmable snippet previous example named placeholder firstname example this usage placeholder transformation this allows user indicate that one more values supplied for placeholder should be replicated transformed other places within text programmable snippet for example user may supply document title one part snippet specify that document title should be repeated other places with first instance being all-uppercase every other instance being lower-case snippet programming features for applications that support scriptable snippets range supported programming features varies following enumerates some features that are commonly implemented for programmable snippets plain text although plain text fundamental feature included even with applications that support only non-programmable static snippets programmable snippets are also used for working with plain text one common complication however that environments that support programmable snippets often have make distinctions between what counts plain text what counts programming instructions further complicating this distinction fact that applications that support programmable snippets almost always include support for recognition multiple programming languages either through basic syntax highlighting execution embedded commands for these other reasons emitting plain text from programmable snippets almost always entails being careful avoid problems with syntax delimiter collisions constants variables programmable snippets often include ability establish binding existing variable scope namespace from which user can select any various constants variables these might include values such email address currently logged-in user on given machine current system time date output value function scriptable snippets are often associated with one more currently active files consequently variables may also include environment variables arguments that specify filename cursor position parent directory among other stats relating files current editing session interpreted code scriptable snippets may allow execution code one more programming languages this may include one more standalone languages language that specific application which language
