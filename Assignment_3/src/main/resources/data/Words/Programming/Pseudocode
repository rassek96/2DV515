unsourced material may be challenged removed august learn how when remove this template message pseudocode informal high-level description operating principle computer program other algorithm uses structural conventions normal programming language but intended for human reading rather than machine reading pseudocode typically omits details that are essential for machine understanding algorithm such variable declarations system-specific code some subroutines programming language augmented with natural language description details where convenient with compact mathematical notation purpose using pseudocode that easier for people understand than conventional programming language code that efficient environment-independent description key principles algorithm commonly used textbooks scientific publications that are documenting various algorithms also planning computer program development for sketching out structure program before actual coding takes place no standard for pseudocode syntax exists program pseudocode not executable program pseudocode resembles but should not be confused with skeleton programs which can be compiled without errors flowcharts drakon-charts unified modeling language uml charts can be thought graphical alternative pseudocode but are more spacious on paper languages such haggis bridge gap between pseudocode code written on programming languages its main use introduce students high level languages through use this hybrid language contents application syntax mathematical style pseudocode o common mathematical symbols o example machine compilation pseudocode style languages o natural language grammar programming languages o mathematical programming languages see also references external links application textbooks scientific publications related computer science numerical computation often use pseudocode description algorithms so that all programmers can understand them even if they do not all know same programming languages textbooks there usually accompanying introduction explaining particular conventions use level detail pseudo-code may some cases approach that formalized general-purpose languages programmer who needs implement specific algorithm especially unfamiliar one will often start with pseudocode description then translate that description into target programming language modify interact correctly with rest program programmers may also start project by sketching out code pseudocode on paper before writing its actual language top-down structuring approach with process steps be followed refinement syntax name suggests pseudocode generally does not actually obey syntax rules any particular language there no systematic standard form although any particular writer will generally borrow style syntax for example control structures from some conventional programming language popular syntax sources include fortran pascal basic c c++ java lisp algol variable declarations are typically omitted function calls blocks code such code contained within loop are often replaced by one-line natural language sentence depending on writer pseudocode may therefore vary widely style from near-exact imitation real programming language at one extreme description approaching formatted prose at other this example pseudocode for mathematical game fizz buzz fortran style pseudo code program fizzbuzz do i = set printnumber true if i divisible by print fizz set printnumber false if i divisible by print buzz set printnumber false if printnumber print i print newline end do pascal style pseudo code procedure fizzbuzz for i = do set printnumber true if i divisible by then print fizz set printnumber false if i divisible by then print buzz set printnumber false if printnumber print i print newline end c style pseudo code void function fizzbuzz { for i = i ≤ ≥ arithmetic + − × / mod floor/ceiling ⌊ ⌋ ⌈ ⌉ ← ⌊b⌋ + ⌈c⌉ logical sums products ∑ ∏ h ← ∑a∈a 1/a example here follows longer

languages various attempts bring elements natural language grammar into computer programming have produced programming languages such hypertalk lingo applescript sql inform some extent python these languages parentheses other special characters are replaced by prepositions resulting quite talkative code these languages are typically dynamically typed meaning that variable declarations other boilerplate code can be omitted such languages may make easier for person without knowledge about language understand code perhaps also learn language however similarity natural language usually more cosmetic than genuine syntax rules may be just strict formal conventional programming do not necessarily make development programs easier mathematical programming languages alternative using mathematical pseudocode involving set theory notation matrix operations for documentation algorithms use formal mathematical programming language that mix non-ascii mathematical notation program control structures then code can be parsed interpreted by machine several formal specification languages include set theory notation using special characters examples are z notation vienna development method specification language vdm-sl some array programming languages include vectorized expressions matrix operations non-ascii formulas mixed with conventional control structures examples are
