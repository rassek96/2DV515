reading external links history following release miranda by research software ltd interest lazy functional languages grew by more than dozen non-strict purely functional programming languages existed these miranda was used most widely but was proprietary software at conference on functional programming languages computer architecture fpca '87 portland oregon meeting was held during which participants formed strong consensus that committee should be formed define open standard for such languages committee's purpose was consolidate existing functional languages into common one that would serve basis for future research functional-language design haskell first version haskell haskell was defined committee's efforts resulted series language definitions haskell late series culminated haskell intended specify stable minimal portable version language accompanying standard library for teaching base for future extensions committee expressly welcomed creating extensions variants haskell via adding incorporating experimental features february haskell language standard was originally published haskell report january revised version was published haskell language libraries revised report language continues evolve rapidly with glasgow haskell compiler ghc implementation representing current de facto standard haskell early process defining successor haskell standard informally named haskell prime began this was intended be ongoing incremental process revise language definition producing new revision up once per year first revision named haskell was announced november published july haskell adds foreign function interface ffi haskell allowing for bindings other programming languages fixes some syntax issues changes formal grammar bans so-called n-plus-k-patterns that definitions form fact n+1 = n+1 fact n are no longer allowed introduces language-pragma-syntax-extension which allows for code designating haskell source haskell requiring

patternguards relaxeddependencyanalysis languagepragma nonpluskpatterns features main article haskell features see also glasgow haskell compiler § extensions haskell haskell features lazy evaluation pattern matching list comprehension type classes type polymorphism purely functional language which means that general functions haskell have no side effects distinct construct exists represent side effects orthogonal type functions pure function may return side effect which subsequently executed modeling impure functions other languages haskell has strong static type system based on hindley–milner type inference haskell's principal innovation this area add type classes originally conceived principled way add overloading language but since finding many more uses construct which represents side effects example monad monads are general framework which can model different kinds computation including error handling nondeterminism parsing software transactional memory monads are defined ordinary datatypes but haskell provides some syntactic sugar for their use haskell has open published specification multiple implementations exist its main implementation glasgow haskell compiler ghc both interpreter native-code compiler that runs on most platforms ghc noted for its high-performance implementation concurrency parallelism for having rich type system incorporating recent innovations such generalized algebraic data types type families growing active community exists around language more than third-party open-source libraries tools are available online package repository hackage code examples see also haskell features § examples following hello world program written haskell module main where main io main = putstrln hello world here factorial function haskell defined few different ways -- type annotation optional factorial integral => -> -- using recursion factorial n | n then n factorial n-1 else -- using list factorial n = product -- using fold implements product factorial n = foldl -- point-free style factorial = foldr enumfromto efficient implementation fibonacci numbers infinite list this -- type annotation optional fib int -> integer -- with self-referencing data fib n = fibs n where fibs = scanl + fibs -- -- same coded directly fib n = fibs n where fibs = next fibs next t@b = a+b next t -- similar idea using zipwith fib n = fibs n where fibs = zipwith + fibs tail fibs -- using generator function fib n = fibs n where fibs ab = fibs ba+b int type refers machine-sized integer used list subscript with operator while integer arbitrary-precision integer for example using integer factorial code above easily computes factorial huge number digits with no loss precision this implementation algorithm similar quick sort over lists which first element taken pivot -- using list comprehensions quicksort ord => -> quicksort = -- empty list already sorted quicksort xxs = quicksort -- sort right part list -- using filter quicksort ord => -> quicksort = quicksort xxs = quicksort filter =x xs implementations all listed implementations are distributed under open source licenses implementations which comply fully very nearly with haskell standard include glasgow haskell compiler ghc compiles native code on many different processor architectures ansi c via one two intermediate languages c-- more recent versions llvm formerly low level virtual machine bitcode ghc has become de facto standard haskell dialect there are libraries eg bindings opengl that will work only with ghc ghc also distributed along with haskell platform utrecht haskell compiler uhc haskell implementation from utrecht university supports almost all haskell features plus many experimental extensions implemented using attribute grammars currently mainly used for research into generated type systems language extensions jhc haskell compiler written by john meacham emphasising speed efficiency generated programs exploring new program transformations o ajhc fork jhc lhc whole-program optimizing backend for ghc based on urban boquist’s compiler intermediate language grin older versions lhc were based on jhc rather than ghc implementations no longer being actively maintained include haskell user's gofer system hugs bytecode interpreter used be one implementations used most widely alongside ghc compiler but has now been mostly replaced by ghci also comes with graphics library nhc98 bytecode compiler focusing on minimizing memory use o york haskell compiler yhc was fork nhc98 with goals being simpler more portable efficient integrating support for hat haskell tracer also had javascript backend allowing users run haskell programs web browsers hbc early implementation supporting haskell was implemented by lennart augustsson based on lazy ml has not been actively developed for some time implementations not fully haskell compliant using variant haskell language include gofer was educational dialect haskell with feature called constructor classes developed by mark jones was supplanted by hugs see above helium newer dialect haskell focus on make learning easier via clearer error messages currently lacks full

also acknowledging theoretical motives for addition purely practical considerations such improved performance they note that addition adding some performance overhead lazy evaluation makes more difficult for programmers reason about performance their code particularly its space use bastiaan heeren daan leijen arjan van ijzendoorn also observed some stumbling blocks for haskell learners subtle syntax sophisticated type system haskell are double edged sword – highly appreciated by experienced programmers but also source frustration among beginners since generality haskell often leads cryptic error messages address these researchers from utrecht university developed advanced interpreter called helium which improved user-friendliness error messages by limiting generality some haskell features particular removing support for type classes ben lippmeier designed disciple strict-by-default lazy by explicit annotation dialect haskell with type-and-effect system address haskell's difficulties reasoning about lazy evaluation using traditional data structures such mutable arrays he argues p that destructive update furnishes programmer with two important powerful tools set efficient array-like data structures for managing collections objects ability broadcast new value all parts program with minimal burden on programmer robert harper one authors standard ml has given his reasons for not using haskell teach introductory programming among these are difficulty reasoning about resource use with non-strict evaluation that lazy evaluation complicates definition
