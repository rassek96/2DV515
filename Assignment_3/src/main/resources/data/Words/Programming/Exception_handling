exception handling from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search exception handling process responding occurrence during computation exceptions – anomalous exceptional conditions requiring special processing – often changing normal flow program execution provided by specialized programming language constructs computer hardware mechanisms general exception breaks normal flow execution executes pre-registered exception handler details how this done depends on whether hardware software exception how software exception implemented some exceptions especially hardware ones may be handled so gracefully execution can resume where was interrupted alternative approaches exception handling software are error checking which maintains normal program flow with later explicit checks for contingencies reported using special return values some auxiliary global variable such c's errno floating point status flags input validation preemptively filter exceptional cases some programmers write software with error reporting features that collect details that may be helpful fixing problem display those details on screen store them file such core dump some cases automatic error reporting

error handling service routines state before exception saved on stack hardware exception handling/traps ieee floating point exception handling ieee floating point hardware standard refers general exceptional conditions defines exception event that occurs when operation on some particular operands has no outcome suitable for every reasonable application that operation might signal one more exceptions by invoking default if explicitly requested language-defined alternate handling by default ieee exception resumable handled by substituting predefined value for different exceptions eg infinity for divide by zero exception providing status flags for later checking whether exception occurred see c99 programming language for typical example handling ieee exceptions exception-handling style enabled by use status flags involves first computing expression using fast direct implementation checking whether failed by testing status flags then if necessary calling slower more numerically robust implementation ieee standard uses term trapping refer calling user-supplied exception-handling routine on exceptional conditions optional feature standard standard recommends several usage scenarios for this including implementation non-default pre-substitution value followed by resumption concisely handle removable singularities default ieee exception handling behaviour resumption following pre-substitution default value avoids risks inherent changing flow program control on numerical exceptions for example maiden flight ariane flight ended catastrophic explosion due part ada programming language exception handling policy aborting computation on arithmetic error which this case was 64-bit floating point 16-bit integer conversion overflow ariane flight case programmers protected only four out seven critical variables against overflow due concerns about computational constraints on-board computer relied on what turned out be incorrect assumptions about possible range values for three unprotected variables because they reused code from ariane for which their assumptions were correct according william kahan loss flight would have been avoided if ieee exception-handling policy default substitution had been used because overflowing 64-bit 16-bit conversion that caused software abort occurred piece code that turned out be completely unnecessary on ariane official report on crash conducted by inquiry board headed by jacques-louis lions noted that underlying theme development ariane bias towards mitigation random failure supplier sri was only following specification given which stipulated that event any detected exception processor was be stopped exception which occurred was not due random failure but design error exception was detected but inappropriately handled because view had been taken that software should be considered correct until shown be at fault although failure was due systematic software design error mechanisms can be introduced mitigate this type problem for example computers within sris could have continued provide their best estimates required attitude information there reason for concern that software exception should be allowed even required cause processor halt while handling mission-critical equipment indeed loss proper software function hazardous because same software runs both sri units case ariane this resulted switch-off two still healthy critical units equipment from processing point view hardware interrupts are similar resumable exceptions though they are typically unrelated user program's control flow exception handling software software exception handling support provided by software tools differs somewhat from what understood under exception hardware but similar concepts are involved programming language mechanisms for exception handling term exception typically used specific sense denote data structure storing information about exceptional condition one mechanism transfer control raise exception known throw exception said be thrown execution transferred catch from point view author routine raising exception useful way signal that routine could not execute normally - for example when input argument invalid eg value outside domain function when resource relies on unavailable like missing file hard disk error out-of-memory errors systems without exceptions routines would need return some special error code however this sometimes complicated by semipredicate problem which users routine need write extra code distinguish normal return values from erroneous ones programming languages differ substantially their notion what exception contemporary languages can roughly be divided two groups languages where exceptions are designed be used flow control structures ada java modula-3 ml ocaml python ruby fall this category languages where exceptions are only used handle abnormal unpredictable erroneous situations c++ c common lisp eiffel modula-2 kiniry also notes that language design only partially influences use exceptions consequently manner which one handles partial total failures during system execution other major influence examples use typically core libraries code examples technical books magazine articles online discussion forums organization’s code standards contemporary applications face many design challenges when considering exception handling strategies particularly modern enterprise level applications exceptions must often cross process boundaries machine boundaries part designing solid exception handling strategy recognizing when process has failed point where cannot be economically handled by software portion process exception handling often not handled correctly software especially when there are multiple sources exceptions data flow analysis million lines java code found over exception handling defects history software exception handling developed lisp 1960s 1970s this originated lisp where exceptions were caught by errset keyword which returned nil case error instead terminating program entering debugger error raising was introduced maclisp late 1960s via err keyword this was rapidly used not only for error raising but for non-local control flow thus was augmented by two new keywords catch throw maclisp june reserving errset err for error handling cleanup behavior now generally called finally was introduced nil new implementation lisp mid- late-1970s unwind-protect this was then adopted by common lisp contemporary with this was dynamic-wind scheme which handled exceptions closures first papers on structured exception handling were goodenough 1975a goodenough 1975b exception handling was subsequently widely adopted by many programming languages from 1980s onward originally software exception handling included both resumable exceptions resumption semantics like most hardware exceptions non-resumable exceptions termination semantics however resumption semantics were considered ineffective practice 1970s 1980s see c++ standardization discussion quoted below are no longer common use though provided by programming languages like common lisp dylan termination semantics exception handling mechanisms contemporary languages are typically non-resumable termination semantics opposed hardware exceptions which are typically resumable this based on experience using both there are theoretical design arguments favor either decision these were extensively debated during c++ standardization discussions 1989–1991 which resulted definitive decision for termination semantics on rationale for such design for c++ mechanism stroustrup notes t palo alto meeting november we heard brilliant summary arguments for termination semantics backed with both personal experience data from jim mitchell from sun formerly from xerox parc jim had used exception handling half dozen languages over period years was early proponent resumption semantics one main designers implementers xerox's cedar/mesa system his message was “termination preferred over resumption this not matter opinion but matter years experience resumption seductive but not valid” he backed this statement with experience from several operating systems key example was cedar/mesa was written by people who liked used resumption but after ten years use there was only one use resumption left half million line system – that was context inquiry because resumption wasn't actually necessary for such context inquiry they removed found significant speed increase that part system each every case where resumption had been used had – over ten years – become problem more appropriate design had replaced basically every use resumption had represented failure keep separate levels abstraction disjoint criticism contrasting view on safety exception handling was given by car hoare described ada programming language having plethora features notational conventions many them unnecessary some them like exception handling even dangerous do not allow this language its present state be used applications where reliability critical next rocket go astray result programming language error may not be exploratory space rocket on harmless trip venus may be nuclear warhead exploding over one our own cities citing multiple prior studies by others 1999–2004 their own results weimer necula wrote that significant problem with exceptions that they create hidden control-flow paths that are difficult for programmers reason about827 one case early criticism against exception handling was dealing with resource acquisition such holding mutex this problem ended up being solved by raii but while raii solves fact that needed still source criticism exception support programming languages see also exception handling syntax many computer languages have built-in support for exceptions exception handling this includes actionscript ada blitzmax c++ c cobol d ecmascript eiffel java ml object pascal eg delphi free pascal like powerbuilder objective-c ocaml php version pl/1 pl/sql prolog python realbasic ruby scala seed7 tcl visual prolog most net languages exception handling commonly not resumable those languages when exception thrown program searches back through stack function calls until exception handler found some languages call for unwinding stack this search progresses that if function f containing handler h for exception e calls function g which turn calls function h exception e occurs h then functions h g may be terminated h f will handle e exception-handling language without this unwinding common lisp with its condition system common lisp calls exception handler does not unwind stack this allows program continue computation at exactly same place where error occurred for example when previously missing file has become available stackless implementation mythryl programming language supports constant-time exception handling without stack unwinding excluding minor syntactic differences there are only couple exception handling styles use most popular style exception initiated by special statement throw raise with exception object eg with java object pascal value special extendable enumerated type eg with ada scope for exception handlers starts with marker clause try language's block starter such begin ends start first handler clause catch except rescue several handler clauses can follow each can specify which exception types handles what name uses for exception object few languages also permit clause else that used case no exception occurred before end handler's scope was reached more common related clause finally ensure that executed whether exception occurred not typically release resources acquired within body exception-handling block notably c++ does not provide this construct since encourages resource acquisition initialization raii technique which frees resources using destructors its whole exception handling code might look like this java-like pseudocode note that exception type called emptylineexception would need be declared somewhere try { line = consolereadline if linelength == { throw new emptylineexceptionthe line read from console was empty } consoleprintlinehello %s % line consoleprintlinethe program ran successfully } catch emptylineexception e { consoleprintlinehello } catch exception e { consoleprintlineerror + emessage } finally { consoleprintlinethe program terminates now } minor variation some languages use single handler clause which deals with class exception internally according paper by westley wiemer george necula syntax tryfinally blocks java contributing factor software defects when method needs handle acquisition release 3–5 resources programmers are apparently unwilling nest enough blocks due readability concerns even when this would be correct solution possible use single tryfinally block even when dealing with multiple resources but that requires correct use sentinel values which another common source bugs for this type problem 86–87 regarding semantics trycatchfinally construct general wiemer necula write that while try-catch-finally conceptually simple has most complicated execution description language specification requires four levels nested “if”s its official english description short contains large number corner cases that programmers often overlook 813–814 c supports various means error checking but generally not considered support exception handling perl has optional support for structured exception handling by contrast python's support for exception handling pervasive consistent it's difficult write robust python program without using its try except keywords exception handling implementation implementation exception handling programming languages typically involves fair amount support from both code generator runtime system accompanying compiler was addition exception handling c++ that ended useful lifetime original c++ compiler cfront two schemes are most common first dynamic registration generates code that continually updates structures about program state terms exception handling typically this adds new element stack frame layout that knows what handlers are available for function method associated with that frame if exception thrown pointer layout directs runtime appropriate handler code this approach compact terms space but adds execution overhead on frame entry exit was commonly used many ada implementations for example where complex generation runtime support was already needed for many other language features dynamic registration being fairly straightforward define amenable proof correctness second scheme one implemented many production-quality c++ compilers table-driven approach this creates static tables at compile time link time that relate ranges program counter program state with respect exception handling then if exception thrown runtime system looks up current instruction location tables determines what handlers are play what needs be done this approach minimizes executive overhead for case where exception not thrown this happens at cost some space but this space can be allocated into read-only special-purpose data sections that are not loaded relocated until exception actually thrown this second approach also superior terms achieving thread safety other definitional implementation schemes have been proposed well for languages that support metaprogramming approaches that involve no overhead at all have been advanced exception handling based on design by contract different view exceptions based on principles design by contract supported particular by eiffel language idea provide more rigorous basis for exception handling by defining precisely what normal abnormal behavior specifically approach based on two concepts failure inability operation fulfill its contract for example addition may produce arithmetic overflow does not fulfill its contract computing good approximation mathematical sum routine may fail meet its postcondition exception abnormal event occurring during execution routine that routine recipient exception during its execution such abnormal event results from failure operation called by routine safe exception handling principle introduced by bertrand meyer object-oriented software construction then holds that there are only two meaningful ways routine can react when exception occurs failure organized panic routine fixes object's state by re-establishing invariant this organized part then fails panics triggering exception its caller so that abnormal event not ignored retry routine tries algorithm again usually after changing some values so that next attempt will have better chance succeed particular simply ignoring exception not permitted block must either be retried successfully complete propagate exception its caller here example expressed eiffel syntax assumes that routine sendfast normally better way send message but may fail triggering exception if so algorithm next uses sendslow which will fail less often if sendslow fails routine send whole should fail causing caller get exception send m message -- send m through fast link if possible otherwise through slow link local triedfast triedslow boolean do if triedfast then triedslow = true sendslow m else triedfast = true sendfast m end rescue if not triedslow then retry end end boolean local variables are initialized false at start if sendfast fails body do clause will be executed again causing execution sendslow if this execution sendslow fails rescue clause will execute end with no retry no else clause final if causing routine execution whole fail this approach has merit defining clearly what normal abnormal cases are abnormal case causing exception one which routine unable fulfill its contract defines clear distribution roles do clause normal body charge achieving attempting achieve routine's contract rescue clause charge reestablishing context restarting process if this has chance succeeding but not performing any actual computation although exceptions eiffel have fairly clear philosophy kiniry criticizes their implementation because exceptions that are part language definition are represented by integer values developer-defined exceptions by string values additionally because they are basic values not objects they have no inherent semantics beyond that which expressed helper routine which necessarily cannot be foolproof because representation overloading effect eg one cannot differentiate two integers same value uncaught exceptions if exception thrown not caught operationally exception thrown when there no applicable handler specified uncaught exception handled by runtime routine that does this called uncaught exception handler most common default behavior terminate program print error message console usually including debug information such string representation exception stack trace this often avoided by having top-level application-level handler for example event loop that catches exceptions before they reach runtime note that even though uncaught exception may result program terminating abnormally program may not be correct if exception not caught notably by not rolling back partially completed transactions not releasing resources process terminates normally assuming runtime works correctly runtime which controlling execution program can ensure orderly shutdown process multithreaded program uncaught exception thread may instead result termination just that thread not entire process uncaught exceptions thread-level handler are caught by top-level handler this particularly important for servers where for example servlet running its own thread can be terminated without server overall being affected this default uncaught exception handler may be overridden either globally per-thread for example provide alternative logging end-user reporting uncaught exceptions restart threads that terminate due uncaught exception for example java this done for single thread via threadsetuncaughtexceptionhandler globally via threadsetdefaultuncaughtexceptionhandler python this done by modifying sysexcepthook static checking exceptions checked exceptions designers java devised checked exceptions which are special set exceptions checked exceptions that method may raise are part method's signature for instance if method might throw ioexception must declare this fact explicitly its method signature failure do so raises compile-time error kiniry notes however that java's libraries they were were often inconsistent their approach error reporting because not all erroneous situations java are represented by exceptions though many methods return special values which indicate failure encoded constant field related classes checked exceptions are related exception checkers that exist for ocaml programming language external tool for ocaml both invisible ie does not require any syntactic annotations optional ie possible compile run program without having checked exceptions although this not recommended for production code clu programming language had feature with interface closer what java has introduced later function could raise only exceptions listed its type but any leaking exceptions from called functions would automatically be turned into sole runtime exception failure instead resulting compile-time error later modula-3 had similar feature these features don't include compile time checking that central concept checked exceptions hasn't been incorporated into major programming languages other than java c++ programming language introduces optional mechanism for checked exceptions called exception specifications by default any function can throw any exception but this can be limited by throw clause added function signature that specifies which exceptions function may throw exception specifications are not enforced at compile-time violations result global function stdunexpected being called empty exception specification may be given which indicates that function will throw no exception this was not made default when exception handling was added language because would require too much modification existing code would impede interaction with code written another language would tempt programmers into writing too many handlers at local level explicit use empty exception specifications can however allow c++ compilers perform significant code stack layout optimizations that generally have be suppressed when exception handling may take place function some analysts view proper use exception specifications c++ difficult achieve recent c++ language standard c++11 use exception specifications specified preceding version standard c++03 deprecated contrast java languages like c do not enforce that exceptions have be caught according hanspeter mössenböck not distinguishing between to-be-called checked exceptions not-to-be-called unchecked exceptions makes written program more convenient but less robust uncaught exception results abort with stack trace kiniry notes however that java's jdk version throws large number unchecked exceptions one for every lines code whereas eiffel uses them much more sparingly with one thrown every lines code kiniry also writes that any java programmer knows volume try catch code typical java application sometimes larger than comparable code necessary for explicit formal parameter return value checking other languages that do not have checked exceptions fact general consensus among in-the-trenches java programmers that dealing with checked exceptions nearly unpleasant task writing documentation thus many programmers report that they “resent” checked exceptions this leads abundance checked-but-ignored exceptions kiniry also notes that developers c apparently were influenced by this kind user experiences with following quote being attributed them via eric gunnerson examination small programs leads conclusion that requiring exception specifications could both enhance developer productivity enhance code quality but experience with large software projects suggests different result – decreased productivity little no increase code quality according anders hejlsberg there was fairly broad agreement their design group not have checked exceptions language feature c hejlsberg explained interview that “the throws clause at least way it's implemented java doesn't necessarily force you handle exceptions but if you don't handle them forces you acknowledge precisely which exceptions might pass through requires you either catch declared exceptions put them your own throws clause work around this requirement people do ridiculous things for example they decorate every method with throws exception that just completely defeats feature you just made programmer write more gobbledy gunk that doesn't help anybody” views on usage this section written like personal reflection opinion essay that states wikipedia editor's personal feelings about topic please help improve by rewriting encyclopedic style july learn how when remove this template message checked exceptions can at compile time reduce incidence unhandled exceptions surfacing at runtime given application unchecked exceptions such java objects runtimeexception error remain unhandled however checked exceptions can either require extensive throws declarations revealing implementation details reducing encapsulation encourage coding poorly considered try/catch blocks that can hide legitimate exceptions from their appropriate handlers consider growing codebase over time interface may be declared throw exceptions x & y later version code if one wants throw exception z would make new code incompatible with earlier uses furthermore with adapter pattern where one body code declares interface that then implemented by different body code so that code can be plugged called by first adapter code may have rich set exceptions describe problems but forced use exception types declared interface possible reduce number declared exceptions either by declaring superclass all potentially thrown exceptions by defining declaring exception types that are suitable for level abstraction called method mapping lower level exceptions these types preferably wrapped using exception chaining order preserve root cause addition it's very possible that example above changing interface that calling code would need be modified well since some sense exceptions method may throw are part method's implicit interface anyway using throws exception declaration catch exception e usually sufficient for satisfying checking java while this may have some use essentially circumvents checked exception mechanism which oracle discourages unchecked exception types should generally not be handled except possibly at outermost levels scope these often represent scenarios that do not allow for recovery runtimeexceptions frequently reflect programming defects errors generally represent unrecoverable jvm failures even language that supports checked exceptions there are cases where use checked exceptions not appropriate dynamic checking exceptions point exception handling routines ensure that code can handle error conditions order establish that exception handling routines are sufficiently robust necessary present code with wide spectrum invalid unexpected inputs such can be created via software fault injection mutation testing that also sometimes referred fuzz testing one most difficult types software for which write exception handling routines protocol software since robust protocol implementation must be prepared receive input that does not comply with relevant specifications order ensure that meaningful regression analysis can be conducted throughout software development lifecycle process any exception handling testing should be highly automated test cases must be generated scientific repeatable fashion several commercially available systems exist that perform such testing runtime engine environments such java net there exist tools that attach runtime engine every time that exception interest occurs they record debugging information that existed memory at time exception was thrown call stack heap values these tools are called automated exception handling error interception tools provide 'root-cause' information for exceptions exception synchronicity somewhat related with concept checked exceptions exception synchronicity synchronous exceptions happen at specific program statement whereas asynchronous exceptions can raise practically anywhere follows that asynchronous exception handling can't be required by compiler they are also difficult program with examples naturally asynchronous events include pressing ctrl-c interrupt program receiving signal such stop suspend from another thread execution programming languages typically deal with this by limiting asynchronicity for example java has deprecated use its threaddeath exception that was used allow one thread stop another one instead there can be semi-asynchronous exceptions that only raise suitable locations program synchronously condition systems common lisp dylan smalltalk have condition system see common lisp condition system that encompasses aforementioned exception handling systems those languages environments advent condition generalisation error according kent pitman implies function call only late exception handler decision unwind stack may be taken conditions are generalization exceptions when condition arises appropriate condition handler searched for selected stack order handle condition conditions that do not represent errors may safely go unhandled entirely their only purpose may be propagate hints warnings toward user continuable exceptions this related so-called resumption model exception handling which some exceptions are said be continuable permitted return expression that signaled exception after having taken corrective action handler condition system generalized thus within handler non-serious condition aka continuable exception possible jump predefined restart points aka restarts that lie between signaling expression condition handler restarts are functions closed over some lexical environment allowing programmer repair this environment before exiting condition handler completely unwinding stack even partially restarts separate mechanism from policy condition handling moreover provides separation mechanism from policy restarts provide various possible mechanisms for recovering from error but do not select which mechanism appropriate given situation that province condition handler which since located higher-level code has access broader view example suppose there library function whose purpose parse single syslog file entry what should this function do if entry malformed there no one right answer because same library could be deployed programs for many different purposes interactive log-file browser right thing do might be return entry unparsed so user can see it—but automated log-summarizing program right thing do might be supply null values for unreadable fields but abort with error if too many entries have been malformed that say question can only be answered terms broader goals program which are not known general-purpose library function nonetheless exiting with error message only rarely right answer so instead simply exiting with error function may establish restarts offering various ways continue—for instance skip log entry supply default null values for unreadable fields ask user for missing values unwind stack abort processing with error message restarts offered constitute mechanisms available for recovering from error selection restart by condition handler supplies policy see also exception handling syntax automated exception handling exception safety
