xml for creating recipes markup can be converted html pdf rich text format using programming language xsl markup language system for annotating document way that syntactically distinguishable from text idea terminology evolved from marking up paper manuscripts ie revision instructions by editors traditionally written with blue pencil on authors' manuscripts digital media this blue pencil instruction text was replaced by tags that instructions are expressed directly by tags instruction text encapsulated by tags examples include typesetting instructions such those found troff tex latex structural markers such xml tags markup instructs software that displays text carry out appropriate actions but omitted from version text that users see some markup languages such widely used html have pre-defined presentation semantics—meaning that their specification prescribes how present structured data others such xml do not have them are general purpose hypertext markup language html one

references external links types there are three main general categories electronic markup presentational markup kind markup used by traditional word-processing systems binary codes embedded within document text that produce wysiwyg effect such markup usually hidden from human users even authors editors procedural markup markup embedded text provides instructions for programs that are process text well-known examples include troff tex postscript expected that processor will run through text from beginning end following instructions encountered text with such markup often edited with markup visible directly manipulated by author popular procedural-markup systems usually include programming constructs so macros subroutines can be defined invoked by name descriptive markup markup used label parts document rather than provide specific instructions how they should be processed well-known examples include latex html xml objective decouple inherent structure document from any particular treatment rendition such markup often described semantic example descriptive markup would be html's tag which used label citation descriptive markup—sometimes called logical markup conceptual markup—encourages authors write way that describes material conceptually rather than visually there considerable blurring lines between types markup modern word-processing systems presentational markup often saved descriptive-markup-oriented systems such xml then processed procedurally by implementations programming constructs procedural-markup systems such tex may be used create higher-level markup systems that are more descriptive such latex recent years number small largely unstandardized markup languages have been developed allow authors create formatted text via web browsers for use wikis web forums these are sometimes called lightweight markup languages markdown markup language used by wikipedia are examples such wiki markup history etymology origin term markup derived from traditional publishing practice marking up manuscript which involves adding handwritten annotations form conventional symbolic printer's instructions margins text paper manuscript printed proof for centuries this task was done primarily by skilled typographers known markup men copy markers who marked up text indicate what typeface style size should be applied each part then passed manuscript others for typesetting by hand markup was also commonly applied by editors proofreaders publishers graphic designers indeed by document authors gencode first well-known public presentation markup languages computer text processing was made by william w tunnicliffe at conference although he preferred call generic coding can be seen response emergence programs such runoff that each used their own control notations often specific target typesetting device 1970s tunnicliffe led development standard called gencode for publishing industry later was first chair international organization for standardization committee that created sgml first standard descriptive markup language book designer stanley rice published speculation along similar lines brian reid his dissertation at carnegie mellon university developed theory working implementation descriptive markup actual use however ibm researcher charles goldfarb more commonly seen today father markup languages goldfarb hit upon basic idea while working on primitive document management system intended for law firms helped invent ibm gml later that same year gml was first publicly disclosed goldfarb moved from cambridge massachusetts silicon valley became product planner at ibm almaden research center there he convinced ibm's executives deploy gml commercially part ibm's document composition facility product was widely used business within few years sgml which was based on both gml gencode was developed by goldfarb goldfarb eventually became chair sgml committee sgml was first released by iso iso standard october troff nroff some early examples computer markup languages available outside publishing industry can be found typesetting tools on unix systems such troff nroff these systems formatting commands were inserted into document text so that typesetting software could format text according editor's specifications was trial error iterative process get document printed correctly availability wysiwyg what you see what you get publishing software supplanted much use these languages among casual users though serious publishing work still uses markup specify non-visual structure texts wysiwyg editors now usually save documents markup-language-based format tex another major publishing standard tex created refined by donald knuth 1970s '80s tex concentrated on detailed layout text font descriptions typeset mathematical books this required knuth spend considerable time investigating art typesetting tex mainly used academia where de facto standard many scientific disciplines tex macro package known latex provides descriptive markup system on top tex widely used scribe gml sgml main articles scribe markup language ibm generalized markup language standard generalized markup language first language make clean distinction between structure presentation was scribe developed by brian reid described his doctoral thesis scribe was revolutionary number ways not least that introduced idea styles separated from marked up document grammar controlling usage descriptive elements scribe influenced development generalized markup language later sgml direct ancestor html latex early 1980s idea that markup should be focused on structural aspects document leave visual presentation that structure interpreter led creation sgml language was developed by committee chaired by goldfarb incorporated ideas from many different sources including tunnicliffe's project gencode sharon adler anders berglund james marke were also key members sgml committee sgml specified syntax for including markup documents well one for separately describing what tags were allowed where document type definition dtd schema this allowed authors create use any markup they wished selecting tags that made most sense them were named their own natural languages thus sgml properly meta-language many particular markup languages are derived from from late '80s on most substantial new markup languages have been based on sgml system including for example tei docbook sgml was promulgated international standard by international organization for standardization iso sgml found wide acceptance use fields with very large-scale documentation requirements however many found cumbersome difficult learn—a side effect its design attempting do too much be too flexible for example sgml made end tags start-tags even both optional certain contexts because its developers thought markup would be done manually by overworked support staff who would appreciate saving keystrokes html main article html physicist sir tim berners-lee wrote memo proposing internet -based hypertext system then specified html wrote browser server software last part first publicly available description html was document called html tags first mentioned on internet by berners-lee late describes elements comprising initial relatively simple design html except for hyperlink tag these were strongly influenced by sgmlguid in-house sgml-based documentation format at cern eleven these elements still exist html berners-lee considered html sgml application internet engineering task force ietf formally defined such with mid-1993 publication first proposal for html specification hypertext markup language html internet-draft by berners-lee dan connolly which included sgml document type definition define grammar many html text elements are found iso technical report tr techniques for using sgml which turn covers features early text formatting languages such that used by runoff command developed early 1960s for ctss compatible time-sharing system operating system these formatting commands were derived from those used by typesetters manually format documents steven derose argues that html's use descriptive markup influence sgml particular was major factor success web because flexibility extensibility that enabled html became main markup language for creating web pages other information that can be displayed web browser quite likely most used markup language world today xml main article xml xml extensible markup language meta markup language that now widely used xml was developed by world wide web consortium committee created chaired by jon bosak main purpose xml was simplify sgml by focusing on particular problem—documents on internet xml remains meta-language like sgml allowing users create any tags needed hence extensible then describing those tags their permitted uses xml adoption was helped because every xml document can be written such way that also sgml document existing sgml users software could switch xml fairly easily however xml eliminated many more complex human-oriented features sgml simplify implementation environments such documents publications however appeared strike happy medium between simplicity flexibility was rapidly adopted for many other uses xml now widely used for communicating data between applications xhtml main article xhtml since january all w3c recommendations for html have been based on xml rather than sgml using abbreviation xhtml extensible hypertext m arkup language language specification requires that xhtml web documents must be well-formed xml documents this allows for more rigorous robust documents while using tags familiar from html one most noticeable differences between html xhtml rule that all tags must be closed empty html tags such must either be closed with regular end-tag replaced by special form space before '/' on end tag optional but frequently used because enables some pre-xml web browsers sgml parsers accept tag another that all attribute values tags must be quoted finally all tag attribute names within xhtml namespace must be lowercase be valid html on other hand was case-insensitive other xml-based applications many xml-based applications now exist including resource description framework rdf/xml xforms docbook soap web ontology language owl for partial list these see list xml markup languages features common feature many markup languages that they intermix text document with markup instructions same data stream file this not necessary possible isolate markup from text content using pointers offsets ids other methods co-ordinate two such standoff markup typical for internal representations that programs use work with marked-up documents however embedded inline markup much more common elsewhere here for example small section text marked up html anatidae family anatidae includes ducks geese swans but not closely related screamers codes enclosed angle-brackets are markup instructions known tags while text between these instructions actual text document codes h1 p em are examples semantic markup that they describe intended purpose meaning text they include specifically h1 means this first-level heading p means this paragraph em means this emphasized word phrase program interpreting such structural markup may apply its own rules styles for presenting various pieces text using different typefaces boldness font size indentation colour other styles desired tag such h1 header level might be presented large bold sans-serif typeface for example monospaced typewriter-style document might be underscored – might not change presentation at all contrast i tag html example presentational markup generally used specify particular characteristic text this case use italic typeface without specifying reason for that appearance text encoding initiative tei has published extensive guidelines for how encode texts interest humanities social sciences developed through years international cooperative work these guidelines are used by projects encoding historical documents works particular scholars periods genres so on alternative usage while idea markup language originated with text documents there increasing use markup languages presentation other types information including playlists vector graphics web services content syndication user interfaces most these are xml applications because xml well-defined extensible language use xml has also led possibility combining multiple markup languages into single profile like xhtml+smil xhtml+mathml+svg because markup languages more generally data description languages not necessarily textual markup are not programming languages they are data without instructions they are more easily manipulated than programming languages—for example web pages are presented html documents not c code thus can be embedded within other web pages displayed when only partially received so forth this leads web design principle rule least power which advocates using least computationally powerful language that satisfies task facilitate such manipulation reuse see also comparison document markup languages curl
