decidability logic from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search logic term decidable refers decision problem question existence effective method for determining membership set formulas more precisely algorithm that can will return boolean true false value instead looping indefinitely logical systems such propositional logic are decidable if membership their set logically valid formulas theorems can be effectively determined theory set sentences closed under logical consequence fixed logical system decidable if there effective method for determining whether arbitrary formulas are included theory many important problems are undecidable that has been proven that no effective method can exist for them contents relationship computability decidability logical system decidability theory some decidable theories some undecidable theories semidecidability relationship with completeness see also references o notes o bibliography relationship computability with concept decidable set definition decidable theory logical system can be given either terms effective methods terms computable functions these are generally considered equivalent per church's thesis indeed proof that logical system theory undecidable will use formal definition computability show that appropriate set not decidable set then invoke church's thesis show that theory logical system not decidable by any effective method enderton pp 206ff decidability logical system each logical system comes with both syntactic component which among other things determines notion provability semantic component which determines notion logical validity logically valid formulas system are sometimes called theorems system especially context first-order logic where gödel's completeness theorem establishes equivalence semantic syntactic consequence other settings such linear logic syntactic consequence provability relation may be used define theorems system logical system decidable if there effective method for determining whether arbitrary formulas are theorems logical system for example propositional logic decidable because truth-table method can be used determine whether arbitrary propositional formula logically valid first-order logic not decidable general particular set logical validities any signature that includes equality at least one other predicate with two more arguments not decidable logical systems extending first-order logic such second-order logic type theory are also undecidable validities monadic predicate calculus with identity are decidable however this system first-order logic restricted signatures that have no function symbols whose relation symbols other than equality never take more than one argument some logical systems are not adequately represented by set theorems alone for example kleene's logic has no theorems at all such cases alternative definitions decidability logical system are often used which ask for effective method for determining something more general than just validity formulas for instance validity sequents consequence relation {г | г ⊧ a} logic decidability theory theory set formulas which here assumed be closed under logical consequence question decidability for theory whether there effective procedure that given arbitrary formula signature theory decides whether formula member theory not this problem arises naturally when theory defined set logical consequences fixed set axioms examples decidable first-order theories include theory real closed fields presburger arithmetic while theory groups robinson arithmetic are examples undecidable theories there are several basic results about decidability theories every inconsistent theory decidable every formula signature theory will be logical consequence thus member theory every complete recursively enumerable first-order theory decidable extension decidable theory may not be decidable for example there are undecidable theories propositional logic although set validities smallest theory decidable consistent theory that has property that every consistent extension undecidable said be essentially undecidable fact every consistent extension will be essentially undecidable theory fields undecidable but not essentially undecidable robinson arithmetic known be essentially undecidable thus every consistent theory that includes interprets robinson arithmetic also essentially undecidable some decidable theories some decidable theories include monk p set first-order logical validities signature with only equality established by leopold löwenheim set first-order logical validities signature with equality one unary function established by ehrenfeucht first-order theory natural numbers signature with equality addition also called presburger arithmetic completeness was established by mojżesz presburger first-order theory natural numbers signature with equality multiplication also called skolem arithmetic first-order theory boolean algebras established by alfred tarski first-order theory algebraically closed fields given characteristic established by tarski first-order theory real-closed ordered fields established by tarski see also tarski's exponential function problem first-order theory euclidean geometry established by tarski first-order theory hyperbolic geometry established by schwabhäuser specific decidable sublanguages set theory investigated 1980s through todaycantone et al methods used establish decidability include quantifier elimination model completeness vaught's test some undecidable theories some undecidable theories include monk p set logical validities any first-order signature with equality either relation symbol arity no less than two unary function symbols one function symbol arity no less than established by trakhtenbrot first-order theory natural numbers with addition multiplication equality established by tarski andrzej mostowski first-order theory rational numbers with addition multiplication equality established by julia robinson first-order theory groups established by alfred tarski remarkably not only general theory groups undecidable but also several more specific theories for example established by mal'cev theory finite groups mal'cev also established that theory semigroups theory rings are undecidable robinson established that theory fields undecidable robinson arithmetic therefore any consistent extension such peano arithmetic essentially undecidable established by raphael robinson first-order theory with equality two function symbols interpretability method often used establish undecidability theories if essentially undecidable theory t interpretable consistent theory s then s also essentially undecidable this closely related concept many-one reduction computability theory semidecidability property theory logical system weaker than decidability semidecidability theory semidecidable if there effective method which given arbitrary formula will always tell correctly when formula theory but may give either negative answer no answer at all when formula not theory logical system semidecidable if there effective method for generating theorems only theorems such that every theorem will eventually be generated this different from decidability because semidecidable system there may be no effective procedure for checking that formula not theorem every decidable theory logical system semidecidable but general converse not true theory decidable if only if both its complement are semi-decidable for example set logical validities v first-order logic semi-decidable but not decidable this case because there no effective method for determining for arbitrary formula whether not v similarly set logical consequences any recursively enumerable set first-order axioms semidecidable many examples undecidable first-order theories given above are this form relationship with completeness decidability should not be confused with completeness for example theory algebraically closed fields decidable but incomplete whereas set all true first-order statements about nonnegative integers language with + × complete but undecidable unfortunately terminological ambiguity term undecidable statement sometimes used synonym for independent statement see also logic portal lászló kalmár alonzo church wvo quine meyer lambert
