are over college university chapters first student chapter was founded at university louisiana at lafayette many sigs like siggraph sigplan sigcse sigcomm sponsor regular conferences which have become famous dominant venue for presenting innovations certain fields groups also publish large number specialized journals magazines newsletters acm also sponsors other computer science related events such worldwide acm international collegiate programming contest icpc has sponsored some other events such chess match between garry kasparov ibm deep blue computer services publications main category

toplas although communications no longer publishes primary research not considered prestigious venue many great debates results computing history have been published its pages acm has made almost all its publications available paid subscribers online at its digital library also has guide computing literature individual members additionally have access safari books online books24x7 acm also offers insurance online courses other services its members acm press published wizards their wonders portraits computing isbn written by christopher morgan with new photographs by louis fabian bachrach book collection historic current portrait photographs figures from computer industry portal digital library acm portal online service acm its core are two main sections acm digital library acm guide computing literature acm digital library full-text collection all articles published by acm its articles magazines conference proceedings guide bibliography computing with over one million entries acm digital library contains comprehensive archive starting 1950s organization's journals magazines newsletters conference proceedings online services include forum called ubiquity tech news digest there

record all metadata digital library open world including abstracts linked references citing works citation usage statistics well all functionality services other than free articles full-texts are accessed by subscription competition acm's primary historical competitor has been ieee computer society which largest subgroup institute electrical electronics engineers ieee focuses more on hardware standardization issues than theoretical computer science but there considerable overlap with acm's agenda they occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computing curricula some major awards computer science are given jointly by acm ieee–cs there also mounting challenge acm's publication practices coming from open access movement some authors see centralized peer–review process less relevant publish on their home pages on unreviewed sites like arxiv other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free online such journal artificial intelligence research jair journal machine learning research jmlr journal research practice information technology membership grades addition student regular members acm has several advanced membership grades recognize those with multiple years membership demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers fellows see also list fellows association for computing machinery acm fellows program was established by council association for computing machinery recognize honor outstanding acm members for their achievements computer science information technology for their significant contributions mission acm there are presently about fellows out about professional members distinguished members acm began recognizing two additional membership grades one which was called distinguished members distinguished members distinguished engineers distinguished scientists distinguished educators have at least years professional experience years continuous acm membership have made significant impact on computing field note that when distinguished members first came out one three levels was called distinguished member was changed about two years later distinguished educator those who already had distinguished member title had their titles changed one other three titles senior members also acm began recognizing senior members senior members have ten more years professional experience years continuous acm membership chapters acm has three kinds chapters special interest groups professional chapters student chapters acm has professional & sig chapters countries there exist acm student
