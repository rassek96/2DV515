information video games artificial intelligence used generate intelligent behaviors primarily non-player characters npcs often simulating human-like intelligence techniques used typically draw upon existing methods from field artificial intelligence ai however term game ai often used refer broad set algorithms that also include techniques from control theory robotics computer graphics computer science general since game ai for npcs centered on appearance intelligence good gameplay within environment restrictions its approach very different from that traditional ai workarounds cheats are acceptable many cases computer abilities must be toned down give human players sense fairness this for example true first-person shooter games where npcs' otherwise perfect aiming would be beyond human skill contents history views usage o computer simulations board games o modern video games o video game combat ai o uses games beyond npcs cheating ai examples see also references bibliography external links history game playing was area research ai from its inception one first examples ai computerised game nim made published despite being advanced technology year was made years before pong game took form relatively small box was able regularly win games even against highly skilled players game using ferranti mark machine university manchester christopher strachey wrote checkers program dietrich prinz wrote one for chess these were among first computer programs ever written arthur samuel's checkers program developed middle 50s early 60s eventually achieved sufficient skill challenge respectable amateur work on checkers chess would culminate defeat garry kasparov by ibm's deep blue computer first video games developed 1960s early 1970s like spacewar pong gotcha were games implemented on discrete logic strictly based on competition two players without ai games that featured single player mode with enemies started appearing 1970s first notable ones for arcade appeared taito game speed race racing video game atari games qwak duck hunting light gun shooter pursuit fighter aircraft dogfighting simulator two text-based computer games from hunt wumpus star trek also had enemies enemy movement was based on stored patterns incorporation microprocessors would allow more computation random elements overlaid into movement patterns light cycle characters compete be last one riding gltron was during golden age video arcade games that idea ai opponents was largely popularized due success space invaders which sported increasing difficulty level distinct movement patterns in-game events dependent on hash functions based on player's input galaxian added more complex varied enemy movements including maneuvers by individual enemies who break out formation pac-man introduced ai patterns maze games with added quirk different personalities for each enemy karate champ later introduced ai patterns fighting games although poor ai prompted release second version first queen was tactical action rpg which featured characters that can be controlled by computer's ai following leader role-playing video game dragon quest iv introduced tactics system where user can adjust ai routines non-player characters during battle concept later introduced action role-playing game genre by secret mana games like madden football earl weaver baseball tony la russa baseball all based their ai on attempt duplicate on computer coaching managerial style selected celebrity madden weaver la russa all did extensive work with these game development teams maximize accuracy games later sports titles allowed users tune variables ai produce player-defined managerial coaching strategy emergence new game genres 1990s prompted use formal ai tools like finite state machines real-time strategy games taxed ai with many objects incomplete information pathfinding problems real-time decisions economic planning among other things first games genre had notorious problems herzog zwei for example had almost broken pathfinding very basic three-state state machines for unit control dune ii attacked players' base beeline used numerous cheats later games genre exhibited more sophisticated ai later games have used bottom-up ai methods such emergent behaviour evaluation player actions games like creatures black & white fa√ßade interactive story was released used interactive multiple way dialogs ai main aspect game games have provided environment for developing artificial intelligence with potential applications beyond gameplay examples include watson jeopardy-playing computer robocup tournament where robots are trained compete soccer views purists complain that ai term game ai overstates its worth game ai not about intelligence shares few objectives academic field ai whereas real ai addresses fields machine learning decision making based on arbitrary data input even ultimate goal strong ai that can reason game ai often consists half-dozen rules thumb heuristics that are just enough give good gameplay experience historically academic game-ai projects have been relatively separate from commercial products because academic approaches tended be simple non-scalable commercial game ai has developed its own set tools which have been sufficient give good performance many cases game developers' increasing awareness academic ai growing interest computer games by academic community causing definition what counts ai game become less idiosyncratic nevertheless significant differences between different application domains ai mean that game ai can still be viewed distinct subfield ai particular ability legitimately solve some ai problems games by cheating creates important distinction for example inferring position unseen object from past observations can be difficult problem when ai applied robotics but computer game npc can simply look up position game's scene graph such cheating can lead unrealistic behavior so not always desirable but its possibility serves distinguish game ai leads new problems solve such when how use cheating major limitation strong ai inherent depth thinking extreme complexity decision making process this means that although would be then theoretically possible make smart ai problem would take considerable processing power usage computer simulations board games computer chess computer go computer checkers computer poker players computer bridge computer shogi computer arimaa logistello which plays reversi rog-o-matic which plays rogue computer players scrabble variety board games computer olympiad general game playing solved games have computer strategy which guaranteed be optimal some cases force win draw modern video games main article video game bot game ai/heuristic algorithms are used wide variety quite disparate fields inside game most obvious control any npcs game although scripting currently most common means control pathfinding another common use for ai widely seen real-time strategy games pathfinding method for determining how get npc from one point on map another taking into consideration terrain obstacles possibly fog war beyond pathfinding navigation sub-field game ai focusing on giving npcs capability navigate their environment finding path target while avoiding collisions with other entities other npc players collaborating with them group navigation concept emergent ai has recently been explored games such creatures black & white nintendogs toys such tamagotchi pets these games are able learn from actions taken by player their behavior modified accordingly while these choices are taken from limited pool does often give desired illusion intelligence on other side screen video game combat ai many contemporary video games fall under category action first person shooter adventure most these types games there some level combat that takes place ai's ability be efficient combat important these genres common goal today make ai more human at least appear so one more positive efficient features found modern-day video game ai ability hunt ai originally reacted very black white manner if player were specific area then ai would react either complete offensive manner be entirely defensive recent years idea hunting has been introduced this 'hunting' state ai will look for realistic markers such sounds made by character footprints they may have left behind these developments ultimately allow for more complex form play with this feature player can actually consider how approach avoid enemy this feature that particularly prevalent stealth genre another development recent game ai has been development survival instinct in-game computers can recognize different objects environment determine whether beneficial detrimental its survival like user ai can look for cover firefight before taking actions that would leave otherwise vulnerable such reloading weapon throwing grenade there can be set markers that tell when react certain way for example if ai given command check its health throughout game then further commands can be set so that reacts specific way at certain percentage health if health below certain threshold then ai can be set run away from player avoid until another function triggered another example could be if ai notices out bullets will find cover object hide behind until has reloaded actions like these make ai seem more human however there still need for improvement this area another side-effect combat ai occurs when two ai-controlled characters encounter each other first popularized id software game doom so-called 'monster infighting' can break out certain situations specifically ai agents that are programmed respond hostile attacks will sometimes attack each other if their cohort's attacks land too close them case doom published gameplay manuals even suggest taking advantage monster infighting order survive certain levels difficulty settings uses games beyond npcs georgios n yannakakis suggests that academic ai developments can play roles game ai beyond traditional paradigm ai controlling npc behavior he highlights four other potential application areas player-experience modeling discerning ability emotional state player so tailor game appropriately this can include dynamic game difficulty balancing which consists adjusting difficulty video game real-time based on player's ability game ai may also help deduce player intent such gesture recognition procedural-content generation creating elements game environment like environmental conditions levels even music automated way ai methods can generate new content interactive stories data mining on user behavior this allows game designers explore how people use game what parts they play most what causes them stop playing allowing developers tune gameplay improve monetization alternate approaches npcs these include changing game set-up enhance npc believability exploring social rather than individual npc behavior cheating ai context artificial intelligence video games cheating refers programmer giving agents actions access information that would be unavailable player same situation simple example if agents want know if player nearby they can either be given complex human-like sensors seeing hearing etc they can cheat by simply asking game engine for player's position common variations include giving ais higher speeds racing games catch up player spawning them advantageous positions first person shooters use cheating ai shows limitations intelligence achievable artificially generally speaking games where strategic creativity important humans could easily beat ai after minimum trial error if were not for this advantage cheating often implemented for performance reasons where many cases may be considered acceptable long effect not obvious player while cheating refers only privileges given specifically ai‚Äîit does not include inhuman swiftness precision natural computer‚Äîa player might call computer's inherent advantages cheating if they result agent acting unlike human player sid meier stated that he omitted multiplayer alliances civilization because he found that computer was almost good humans using them which caused players think that computer was cheating examples creatures creatures artificial life program where user hatches small furry animals teaches them how behave these norns can talk feed themselves protect themselves against vicious creatures it's first popular application machine learning into interactive simulation neural networks are used by creatures learn what do game regarded breakthrough artificial life research which aims model behavior creatures interacting with their environment sid meier's alpha centauri halo combat evolved first-person shooter where player assumes role master chief battling various aliens on foot vehicles enemies use cover very wisely employ suppressive fire grenades squad situation affects individuals so certain enemies flee when their leader dies lot attention paid little details with enemies notably throwing back grenades team-members responding you bothering them underlying behavior tree technology has become very popular games industry especially since halo fear first-person shooter where player helps contain supernatural phenomenon armies cloned soldiers ai uses planner generate context-sensitive behaviors first time mainstream game this technology used reference for many studios still today enemies are capable using environment very cleverly finding cover behind tables tipping bookshelves opening doors crashing through windows so on squad tactics are used great effect enemies perform flanking maneuvers use suppression fire etc stalker series 2007- first-person shooter survival horror game where player must face man-made experiments military soldiers mercenaries known stalkers various encountered enemies if difficulty level set its highest use combat tactics behaviours such healing wounded allies giving orders out-flanking player using weapons with pinpoint accuracy far cry first-person shooter where player fights off numerous mercenaries assassinates faction leaders ai behavior based uses action selection essential if ai multitask react situation ai can react unpredictable fashion many situations enemies respond sounds visual distractions such fire nearby explosions can be subject investigate hazard player can utilize these distractions his own advantage there are also social interfaces with ai but however not form direct conversation but more reactionary if player gets too close even nudges ai player subject getting shoved off sworn at by extent getting aimed at other social interfaces between ai exist when combat neutral situations if enemy ai injured on ground he will shout out for help release emotional distress etc see also artificial intelligence portal game development portal behavior model ai effect applications artificial
