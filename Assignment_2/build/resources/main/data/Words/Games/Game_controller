controllers were popular early 2nd console generation for pong games main article paddle game controller paddle controller that features round wheel one more fire buttons wheel typically used control movement player object along one axis video screen paddle controllers were first analog controllers they lost popularity when paddle ball type games fell out favor variation atari driving controller appeared on atari designed specifically for game indy functioned almost identically operation design regular paddle controller exceptions were that its wheel can be continuously rotated either direction was missing extra paddle included on previous model unlike spinner friction prevented wheel from gaining momentum joystick dual-joystick controller for original playstation main article joystick joystick peripheral that consists handheld stick that can be tilted around either two axes sometimes twisted around third joystick often used for flight simulators hotas controllers composed joystick throttle quadrant see below are popular combination for flight simulation among its most fanatic devotees most joysticks are designed be operated with user's primary hand eg with right hand right-handed person with base either held opposite hand mounted on desk arcade controllers are typically joysticks featuring shaft that has ball drop-shaped handle one more buttons for game actions generally layout has joystick on left buttons on right although there are instances when this reversed trackball main article trackball trackball basically upside-down mouse that manipulated with palm one's hand has advantage not requiring lot desktop space that fast one can roll ball on this faster than one can move mouse due space not being issue was precursor mouse notable uses trackball gaming controller would be games such centipede marble madness golden tee golf segasonic hedgehog throttle quadrant throttle quadrant set one more levers that are most often used simulate throttles other similar controls real vehicle particularly aircraft throttle quadrants are most popular conjunction with joysticks yokes used flight simulation steering wheel logitech steering wheel for playstation main article racing wheel racing wheel essentially larger version paddle used most racing arcade games well more recent racing simulators such live for speed grand prix legends gtr2 richard burns rally while most arcade racing games have been using steering wheels since gran trak first steering wheels for home systems appeared on fifth-generation consoles such playstation nintendo many are force feedback see force feedback wheel designed give same feedback would be experienced when driving real car but realism this depends on game they usually come with pedals control gas brake shifting taken care various ways including paddle shifting systems simple stick shifters which are moved forward back change gears more complex shifters which mimic those real vehicles which may also use clutch most wheels turn only degrees lock-to-lock but some models such logitech driving force pro logitech g25 logitech g27 can turn degrees turns lock-to-lock namco jogcon paddle was available for

gyroscope first-person mode yoke yoke very similar steering wheel except that resembles control yoke found on many aircraft has two axes movement not only rotational movement about shaft yoke but also forward-and-backward axis equivalent that pitch control on yoke aircraft some yokes have additional controls attached directly yoke for simulation aircraft functions such radio push-to-talk buttons yokes like throttle quadrants pedals are popular with serious flight-simulation enthusiasts pedals logitech driving force gt pedals may be used for driving simulations flight simulations former case asymmetric set pedals can simulate accelerator brake clutch pedals real automobile latter case symmetric set pedals simulates rudder controls toe brakes aircraft mentioned most steering wheel controllers come with set pedals wasd keyboard setup used widely keyboard & mouse computer keyboard mouse are typical input devices for personal computer are currently main game controllers for computer games mouse often used with mousepad achieve greater speed comfort accuracy smoother movement for gamer some video game consoles also have ability function with keyboard mouse computer keyboard modelled after typewriter keyboard was designed for input written text mouse handheld pointing device used addition keyboard for games keyboard typically controls movement character while mouse used control game camera used for aiming while originally designed for general computer input there are several keyboard mouse peripherals available which are designed specifically for gaming often with gaming-specific functions built-in examples include peripherals by razer zboard range keyboards logitech's 'g' series numeric keypad found on keyboard also used game controller can be found on number separate devices most notably early consoles usually attached joystick paddle keypad small grid keys with at least digits 0-9 gaming keypad specialized controller used for fpss rtss some arcade type games these controllers can be programmed allow emulation keys macros some cases these generally resemble small part keyboard but may also feature other inputs such analog sticks they were developed because some these games require keyboard play some players find this be awkward for such task touchscreen nintendo ds touchscreen bottom with stylus touchscreen input device that allows user interact with computer by touching display screen first attempt at handheld game console with touchscreen controls was sega's intended successor game gear though device was ultimately shelved never released due high cost touchscreen technology early 1990s first released console use touchscreen was tiger gamecom nintendo popularized for use video games with nintendo ds nintendo 3ds other systems including tapwave zodiac well smartphones vast majority pdas have also included this feature primary controller for nintendo's wii u console wii u gamepad features embedded touchscreen modern touch screens use thin durable transparent plastic sheet overlaid onto glass screen location touch calculated from capacitance for x y axes which varies based upon where sheet touched one console that touchscreen but not manufactured by nintendo sony's playstation vita which has inch oled touchscreen breathing controllers breathing controllers help their users improve breathing through video games all controllers have sensors that sense users breath with which user controls video game on computer tablet on smartphone alvio breathing trainer symptom tracker mobile game controller zenytime promotes deep rhythmic breathing trigger shot-term rewards controlled breathing relaxation improved oxygenation breathing games by breathing labs are based on pursed lip breathing are used on iphone / ipad windows os x android devices motion sensing wii remote motion controllers include sega activator released for mega drive genesis based on light harp invented by assaf gurner could read player's physical movements was first controller allow full-body motion sensing however was commercial failure due its unwieldiness inaccuracy nintendo's wii system released utilizes wii remote controller which uses accelerometers detect its approximate orientation acceleration image sensor so can be used pointing device sixaxis dualshock playstation move controllers for sony's playstation system have similar motion sensing capabilities microsoft released kinect for xbox this motion sensing controller uses cameras track players movement microsoft released revised version kinect with launch xbox one this controller was bundled with console on launch was removed from default bundle june sony's eyetoy similarly uses cameras detect player's motions translate them into inputs for game light gun dreamcast light gun main article light gun light gun peripheral used shoot targets on screen they usually roughly resemble firearms ray guns their use normally limited rail shooters shooting gallery games like duck hunt those which came with shooting gallery light gun rare example non-rail first person shooter game taito's video game gun buster first-person shooter that used joystick move light gun aim though light guns have been used earlier arcade games such sega 's periscope missile first home console light gun was released for magnavox odyssey later on nintendo would include one standard on their famicom nes called nes zapper nintendo has also released shell style light gun for more recent wii remote called wii zapper which comes bundled with game link's crossbow training rhythm game controllers guitar controllers rhythm game accessories used for rhythm games can resemble musical instruments such guitars from 5-button guitars guitar freaks guitar hero series rock band series real guitars rock band rocksmith keyboards rock band drums donkey konga drum mania rock band series guitar hero series maracas samba de amigo have also seen some success arcades home consoles other rhythm games are based around art djing turntablism dj hero playing synthesizer iidx using turntable shaped peripheral with buttons wireless wireless versions many popular controller types joypads mice keyboards exist wireless motion controls are emerging class for virtual reality others pinball controllers multi-button consoles for strategy games were released past but their popularity was limited
