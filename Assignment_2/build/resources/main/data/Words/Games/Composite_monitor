display that receives input form analog composite video signal defined specification composite video signal encodes all information on single conductor composite cable has single live conductor plus earth other equipment with display functionality includes monitors with more advanced interfaces connectors giving better picture including analog vga digital dvi hdmi displayport television tv receivers which are self-contained receiving displaying video rf broadcasts received with internal tuner video monitors are used for displaying computer output closed-circuit television eg security cameras other applications requiring two-dimensional monochrome colour image contents inputs early innovations this technology o composite video game consoles composite input non-composite device commercial use composite monitors common features other video standards see also inputs composite monitors usually use rca jacks bnc connectors for video input earlier equipment 1970s often used uhf connectors typically simple composite monitors give picture inferior other interfaces principle monitor can have one several multiple types input including composite—in addition composite monitors such many monitors accept composite input amongst other standards practice computer monitors ceased support composite input other interfaces became predominant composite monitor must have two-dimensional approximately flat display device with circuitry accept composite signal with picture synchronisation information process into monochrome chrominance luminance red green blue rgb plus synchronisation pulses display on screen which was predominantly crt until 21st century then thin panel using lcd other technology critical factor quality this display type encoding used tv camera combine signal together decoding used monitor separate signals back rgb for display composite monitors can be very high quality with professional broadcast reference displays costing us$10k-$15k comb filters are frequently used improve quality composite monitor devices using faroudja decoders are frequently considered pinnacle composite displays early innovations this technology originally these monitors were used for commercial studios composite video first saw home use for dubbing tapes on vcrs early computers both commercial amateur mostly used teleprinters for output simple home models might simply display array lights be interpreted binary information later concept tv typewriter was born effectively video monitor used for digital information this was implemented dedicated monitors interfaces television receivers present many homes many computers incorporated display from late 1970s stand-alone composite monitors came into use including by apple ii commodore vic 20/64/128 atari ibm pc with cga card some computers compatible with other home business computers 1980s these computers had composite video outputs sometimes composite monitors bundled with systems some computer companies separately sold their own composite monitors for use with their computers composite video game consoles during same time period home game consoles chose stick with channel 3/4 outputs since many people had color televisions without composite video inputs however nes was released was first game console feature direct composite outputs although redesigned nes nes lacked these outputs super nes nearly all consoles made since have included direct composite outputs from fifth generation systems such sony playstation nintendo onward many consoles used these outputs primary means connecting television requiring separate adapter for use on televisions lacking composite inputs today some people still use stand-alone composite monitors with modern game consoles even with advent televisions with tuner composite inputs combined composite input non-composite device when composite monitor not available device requiring one can use rf modulator encode composite output onto rf signal which can be received by analog television available many homes until digital switchover devices are available convert from composite other standards such analog vga digital hdmi such devices may be called upscalers scan converters although not all devices with these names will handle composite input price quality vary converter with electronics necessary simple cable will not do job with whole market full all sorts solutions convert composite its related standard s-video all sorts other video transmission standards has even offered opportunities repurpose non-composite monitors for composite video input which composite monitors themselves have also been repurposed for other applications their own commercial use composite monitors television studios use stand-alone composite video monitors check judge their output picture quality these are usually high-end professional broadcast monitors that are used view output professional video cameras vtrs character generators telecines ddrs they can also be used when new video devices are being tested most commercial composite monitors have no audio support speakers audio system processed through high-quality audio equipment stand-alone composite monitors are commonly used for closed-circuit television video surveillance some monitors used video surveillance give monochrome picture common features stereo sound tv tuner front av inputs s-video input closed captioning other video standards other video standards include rgb video signals red green blue with synchronisation information on three wires from computer other source component video signals such yuv y b-y r-y s-video signals which have brightness luminance information on one cable color information chrominance on another most monitors with s-video inputs also support composite inputs several digital video standards including dvi hdmi vga analog standard used display digital signals monitors sometimes support several standards note that absence native support for certain video inputs general can involve purchase special electronic signal adapters order have inexpensive hookup repurpose electronics that are otherwise incompatible see also vga box video projector
