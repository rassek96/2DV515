user interface from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search for boundary between computer systems see interface computing for other uses see interface disambiguation example tangible user interface user interface ui industrial design field human–machine interaction space where interactions between humans machines occur goal this interaction allow effective operation control machine from human end whilst machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids operators' decision-making process examples this broad concept user interfaces include interactive aspects computer operating systems hand tools heavy machinery operator controls process controls design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related involve such disciplines ergonomics psychology generally goal user interface design produce user interface which makes easy self-explanatory efficient enjoyable user-friendly operate machine way which produces desired result this generally means that operator needs provide minimal input achieve desired output also that machine minimizes undesired outputs human with increased use personal computers relative decline societal awareness heavy machinery term user interface generally assumed mean graphical user interface while industrial control panel machinery control design discussions more commonly refer human-machine

switches rubber keypads touchscreens are examples physical part human machine interface which we can see touch complex systems human–machine interface typically computerized term human–computer interface refers this kind system context computing term typically extends well software dedicated control physical elements used for human-computer interaction engineering human–machine interfaces enhanced by considering ergonomics human factors corresponding disciplines are human factors engineering hfe usability engineering ue which part systems engineering tools used for incorporating human factors interface design are developed based on knowledge computer science such computer graphics operating systems programming languages nowadays we use expression graphical user interface for human–machine interface on computers nearly all them are now using graphics terminology human–machine interface usually involves peripheral hardware for input for output often there additional component implemented software like eg graphical user interface there difference between user interface operator interface human–machine interface hmi term user interface often used context personal computer systems electronic devices o where network equipment computers are interlinked through mes manufacturing execution system-or host display information o hmi typically local one machine piece equipment interface method between human equipment/machine operator interface interface method by which multiple equipment that are linked by host control system accessed controlled o system may expose several user interfaces serve different kinds users for example computerized library database might provide two user interfaces one for library patrons limited set functions optimized for ease use other for library personnel wide set functions optimized for efficiency user interface mechanical system vehicle industrial installation sometimes referred human–machine interface hmi hmi modification original term mmi man-machine interface practice abbreviation mmi still frequently used although some may claim that mmi stands for something different now another abbreviation hci but more commonly used for human–computer interaction other terms used are operator interface console oic operator interface terminal oit however abbreviated terms refer 'layer' that separates human that operating machine from machine itself without clean usable interface humans would not be able interact with information systems science fiction hmi sometimes used refer what better described direct neural interface however this latter usage seeing increasing application real-life use medical prostheses—the artificial extension that replaces missing body part eg cochlear implants some circumstances computers might observe user react according their actions without specific commands means tracking parts body required sensors noting position head direction gaze so on have been used experimentally this particularly relevant immersive interfaces history history user interfaces can be divided into following phases according dominant type user interface 1945–1968 batch interface ibm batch era computing power was extremely scarce expensive user interfaces were rudimentary users had accommodate computers rather than other way around user interfaces were considered overhead software was designed keep processor at maximum utilization with little overhead possible input side user interfaces for batch machines were mainly punched cards equivalent media like paper tape output side added line printers these media with limited exception system operator's console human beings did not interact with batch machines real time at all submitting job batch machine involved first preparing deck punched cards describing program dataset punching program cards wasn't done on computer itself but on keypunches specialized typewriter-like machines that were notoriously balky unforgiving prone mechanical failure software interface was similarly unforgiving with very strict syntaxes meant be parsed by smallest possible compilers interpreters holes are punched card according prearranged code transferring facts from census questionnaire into statistics once cards were punched one would drop them job queue wait eventually operators would feed deck computer perhaps mounting magnetic tapes supply another dataset helper software job would generate printout containing final results all too often abort notice with attached error log successful runs might also write result on magnetic tape generate some data cards be used later computation turnaround time for single job often spanned entire days if one were very lucky might be hours real-time response was unheard but there were worse fates than card queue some computers actually required even more tedious error-prone process toggling programs binary code using console switches very earliest machines actually had be partly rewired incorporate program logic into themselves using devices known plugboards early batch systems gave currently running job entire computer program decks tapes had include what we would now think operating system code talk i/o devices do whatever other housekeeping was needed midway through batch period after various groups began experiment with so-called “load-and-go” systems these used monitor program which was always resident on computer programs could call monitor for services another function monitor was do better error checking on submitted jobs catching errors earlier more intelligently generating more useful feedback users thus monitors represented first step towards both operating systems explicitly designed user interfaces 1969–present command-line user interface main article command-line interface teletype model asr command-line interfaces clis evolved from batch monitors connected system console their interaction model was series request-response transactions with requests expressed textual commands specialized vocabulary latency was far lower than for batch systems dropping from days hours seconds accordingly command-line systems allowed user change his her mind about later stages transaction response real-time near-real-time feedback on earlier results software could be exploratory interactive ways not possible before but these interfaces still placed relatively heavy mnemonic load on user requiring serious investment effort learning time master earliest command-line systems combined teleprinters with computers adapting mature technology that had proven effective for mediating transfer information over wires between human beings teleprinters had originally been invented devices for automatic telegraph transmission reception they had history going back had already become well-established newsrooms elsewhere by reusing them economy was certainly consideration but psychology rule least surprise mattered well teleprinters provided point interface with system that was familiar many engineers users dec vt100 terminal widespread adoption video-display terminals vdts mid-1970s ushered second phase command-line systems these cut latency further because characters could be thrown on phosphor dots screen more quickly than printer head carriage can move they helped quell conservative resistance interactive programming by cutting ink paper consumables out cost picture were first tv generation late 1950s 60s even more iconic comfortable than teleprinters had been computer pioneers 1940s just importantly existence accessible screen — two-dimensional display text that could be rapidly reversibly modified — made economical for software designers deploy interfaces that could be described visual rather than textual pioneering applications this kind were computer games text editors close descendants some earliest specimens such rogue6 vi are still live part unix tradition saa user interface text-based user interface with beginning microsoft windows other graphical user interfaces ibm created what called systems application architecture saa standard which include common user access cua derivative cua successfully created what we know use today windows most more recent dos windows console applications will use that standard well this defined that pulldown menu system should be at top screen status bar at bottom shortcut keys should stay same for all common functionality f2 open for example would work all applications that followed saa standard this greatly helped speed at which users could learn application so caught on quick became industry standard 1968–present graphical user interface amx desk made basic wimp gui linotype wysiwyg – douglas engelbart demonstrated nls system which uses mouse pointers hypertext multiple windows – researchers at xerox palo alto research center many from sri develop wimp paradigm windows icons menus pointers – xerox alto commercial failure due expense

most expensive ever made at that time – mit's x window system hardware-independent platform networking protocol for developing guis on unix-like systems – windows – provided gui interface ms-dos no overlapping windows tiled instead – microsoft ibm start work on os/2 meant eventually replace ms-dos windows – apple threatens sue digital research because their gui desktop looked too much like apple's mac – windows – overlapping resizable windows keyboard mouse enhancements – macintosh ii first full-color mac – os/2 standard edition se has gui written by microsoft looks lot like windows interface design primary methods used interface design include prototyping simulation typical human–machine interface design consists following stages interaction specification interface software specification prototyping common practices for interaction specification include user-centered design persona activity-oriented design scenario-based design resiliency design common practices for interface software specification include use cases constrain enforcement by interaction protocols intended avoid use errors common practices for prototyping are based on interactive design based on libraries interface elements controls decoration etc quality all great interfaces share eight qualities characteristics clarity interface avoids ambiguity by making everything clear through language flow hierarchy metaphors for visual elements concision it's easy make interface clear by over-clarifying labeling everything but this leads interface bloat where there just too much stuff on screen at same time if too many things are on screen finding what you're looking for difficult so interface becomes tedious use real challenge making great interface make concise clear at same time familiarity even if someone uses interface for first time certain elements can still be familiar real-life metaphors can be used communicate meaning responsiveness good interface should not feel sluggish this means that interface should provide good feedback user about what's happening whether user's input being successfully processed consistency keeping your interface consistent across your application important because allows users recognize usage patterns aesthetics while you don't need make interface attractive for do its job making something look good will make time your users spend using your application more enjoyable happier users can only be good thing efficiency time money great interface should make user more productive through shortcuts good design forgiveness good interface should not punish users for their mistakes but should instead provide means remedy them principle least astonishment principle least astonishment pola general principle design all kinds interfaces based on idea that human beings can only pay full attention one thing at one time leading conclusion that novelty should be minimized types hp series hp-150 touchscreen direct manipulation interface name general class user interfaces that allow users manipulate objects presented them using actions that correspond at least loosely physical world graphical user interfaces gui accept input via devices such computer keyboard mouse provide articulated graphical output on computer monitor there are at least two different principles widely used gui design object-oriented user interfaces oouis

html based web browser administrative web interfaces for web-servers servers networked computers are often called control panels touchscreens are displays that accept input by touch fingers stylus used growing amount mobile devices many types point sale industrial processes machines self-service machines etc command line interfaces where user provides input by typing command string with computer keyboard system provides output by printing text on computer monitor used by programmers system administrators engineering scientific environments by technically advanced personal computer users touch user interface are graphical user interfaces using touchpad touchscreen display combined input output device they supplement replace other forms output with haptic feedback methods used computerized simulators etc hardware interfaces are physical spatial interfaces found on products real world from toasters car dashboards airplane cockpits they are generally mixture knobs buttons sliders switches touchscreens attentive user interfaces manage user attention deciding when interrupt user kind warnings level detail messages presented user batch interfaces are non-interactive user interfaces where user specifies all details batch job advance batch processing receives output when all processing done computer does not prompt for further input after processing has started conversational interfaces enable users command computer with plain text english eg via text messages chatbots voice commands instead graphic elements these interfaces often emulate human-to-human conversations conversational interface agents attempt personify computer interface form animated person robot other character such microsoft's clippy paperclip present interactions conversational form crossing-based interfaces are graphical user interfaces which primary task consists crossing boundaries instead pointing gesture interfaces are graphical user interfaces which accept input form hand gestures mouse gestures sketched with computer mouse stylus holographic user interfaces provide input electronic electro-mechanical devices by passing finger through reproduced holographic images what would otherwise be tactile controls those devices floating freely air detected by wave source without tactile interaction intelligent user interfaces are human-machine interfaces that aim improve efficiency effectiveness naturalness human-machine interaction by representing reasoning acting on models user domain task discourse media eg graphics natural language gesture motion tracking interfaces monitor user's body motions translate them into commands currently being developed by apple multi-screen interfaces employ multiple displays provide more flexible interaction this often employed computer game interaction both commercial arcades more recently handheld markets non-command user interfaces which observe user infer his / her needs intentions without requiring that he / she formulate explicit commands object-oriented user interfaces ooui are based on object-oriented programming metaphors allowing users manipulate simulated objects their properties reflexive user interfaces where users control redefine entire system via user interface alone for instance change its command verbs typically this only possible with very rich graphic user interfaces search
