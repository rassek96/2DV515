input ext input level adjustment will also be included addition basic instrument most oscilloscopes are supplied with probe shown probe will connect any input on instrument typically has resistor ten times oscilloscope's input impedance this results ‑10x attenuation factor but helps isolate capacitive load presented by probe cable from signal being measured some probes have switch allowing operator bypass resistor when appropriate size portability most modern oscilloscopes are lightweight portable instruments that are compact enough be easily carried by single person addition portable units market offers number miniature battery-powered instruments for field service applications laboratory grade oscilloscopes especially older units which use vacuum tubes are generally bench-top devices may be mounted into dedicated carts special-purpose oscilloscopes may be rack-mounted permanently mounted into custom instrument housing inputs signal be measured fed one input connectors which usually coaxial connector such bnc uhf type binding posts banana plugs may be used for lower frequencies if signal source has its own coaxial connector then simple coaxial cable used otherwise specialised cable called scope probe supplied with oscilloscope used general for routine use open wire test lead for connecting point being observed not satisfactory probe generally necessary general-purpose oscilloscopes usually present input impedance megohm parallel with small but known capacitance such picofarads this allows use standard oscilloscope probes scopes for use with very high frequencies may have 50‑ohm inputs which must be either connected directly 50‑ohm signal source used with z active probes less-frequently-used inputs include one two for triggering sweep horizontal deflection for x‑y mode displays trace brightening/darkening sometimes called z'‑axis inputs probes main article test probe § oscilloscope probes open wire test leads flying leads are likely pick up interference so they are not suitable for low level signals furthermore leads have high inductance so they are not suitable for high frequencies using shielded cable ie coaxial cable better for low level signals coaxial cable also has lower inductance but has higher capacitance typical ohm cable has about pf per meter consequently one-meter direct 1x coaxial probe will load circuit with capacitance about pf resistance megohm minimize loading attenuator probes eg 10x probes are used typical probe uses megohm series resistor shunted by low-value capacitor make rc compensated divider with cable capacitance scope input rc time constants are adjusted match for example megohm series resistor shunted by pf capacitor for time constant microseconds cable capacitance pf parallel with scope input pf megohm total capacitance pf also gives time constant microseconds practice there will be adjustment so operator can precisely match low frequency time constant called compensating probe matching time constants makes attenuation independent frequency at low frequencies where resistance r much less than reactance c circuit looks like resistive divider at high frequencies resistance much greater than reactance circuit looks like capacitive divider result frequency compensated probe for modest frequencies that presents load about megohms shunted by pf although such probe improvement does not work when time scale shrinks several cable transit times transit time typically ns that time frame cable looks like its characteristic impedance there will be reflections from transmission line mismatch at scope input probe that causes ringing modern scope probe uses lossy low capacitance transmission lines sophisticated frequency shaping networks make 10x probe perform well at several hundred megahertz consequently there are other adjustments for completing compensation probes with attenuation are by far most common for large signals slightly-less capacitive loading probes are not rare there are also probes that contain switches select direct ratios but one must be aware that setting has significant capacitance tens pf at probe tip because whole cable's capacitance now directly connected most oscilloscopes allow for probe attenuation factors displaying effective sensitivity at probe tip historically some auto-sensing circuitry used indicator lamps behind translucent windows panel illuminate different parts sensitivity scale do so probe connectors modified bncs had extra contact define probe's attenuation certain value resistor connected ground encodes attenuation because probes wear out because auto-sensing circuitry not compatible between different makes oscilloscope auto-sensing probe scaling not foolproof likewise manually setting probe attenuation prone user error common mistake have probe scaling set incorrectly resultant voltage readings can then be wrong by factor there are special high voltage probes which also form compensated attenuators with oscilloscope input probe body physically large some require partly filling canister surrounding series resistor with volatile liquid fluorocarbon displace air at oscilloscope end box with several waveform-trimming adjustments for safety barrier disc keeps one's fingers distant from point being examined maximum voltage low tens kv observing high voltage ramp can create staircase waveform with steps at different points every repetition until probe tip contact until then tiny arc charges probe tip its capacitance holds voltage open circuit voltage continues climb another tiny arc charges tip further there are also current probes with cores that surround conductor carrying current be examined one type has hole for conductor requires that wire be passed through hole they are for semi-permanent permanent mounting however other types for testing have two-part core that permit them be placed around wire inside probe coil wound around core provides current into appropriate load voltage across that load proportional current however this type probe can sense ac only more-sophisticated probe includes magnetic flux sensor hall effect sensor magnetic circuit probe connects amplifier which feeds low frequency current into coil cancel sensed field magnitude that current provides low-frequency part current waveform right down dc coil still picks up high frequencies there combining network akin loudspeaker crossover network front panel controls focus control this control adjusts crt focus obtain sharpest most-detailed trace practice focus needs be adjusted slightly when observing quite-different signals which means that needs be external control flat-panel displays do not need focus adjustments therefore do not include this control intensity control this adjusts trace brightness slow traces on crt oscilloscopes need less fast ones especially if not often repeated require more on flat panels however trace brightness essentially independent sweep speed because internal signal processing effectively synthesizes display from digitized data astigmatism can also be called shape spot shape adjusts relative voltages on two crt anodes such that displayed spot changes from elliptical one plane through circular spot ellipse at degrees first this control may be absent from simpler oscilloscope designs may even be internal control not necessary with flat panel displays beam finder modern oscilloscopes have direct-coupled deflection amplifiers which means trace could be deflected off-screen they also might have their beam blanked without operator knowing help restoring visible display beam finder circuit overrides any blanking limits beam deflected visible portion screen beam-finder circuits often distort trace while activated graticule graticule grid squares that serve reference marks for measuring displayed trace these markings whether located directly on screen on removable plastic filter usually consist cm grid with closer tick marks often at mm on centre vertical horizontal axis one expects see ten major divisions across screen number vertical major divisions varies comparing grid markings with waveform permits one measure both voltage vertical axis time horizontal axis frequency can also be determined by measuring waveform period calculating its reciprocal on old lower-cost crt oscilloscopes graticule sheet plastic often with light-diffusing markings concealed lamps at edge graticule lamps had brightness control higher-cost instruments have graticule marked on inside face crt eliminate parallax errors better ones also had adjustable edge illumination with diffusing markings diffusing markings appear bright digital oscilloscopes however generate graticule markings on display same way trace external graticules also protect glass face crt from accidental impact some crt oscilloscopes with internal graticules have unmarked tinted sheet plastic light filter enhance trace contrast this also serves protect faceplate crt accuracy resolution measurements using graticule relatively limited better instruments sometimes have movable bright markers on trace that permit internal circuits make more refined measurements both calibrated vertical sensitivity calibrated horizontal time are set - - - steps this leads however some awkward interpretations minor divisions timebase controls computer model impact increasing timebase time/division these select horizontal speed crt's spot creates trace this process commonly referred sweep all but least-costly modern oscilloscopes sweep speed selectable calibrated units time per major graticule division quite wide range sweep speeds generally provided from seconds fast picoseconds fastest per division usually continuously-variable control often knob front calibrated selector knob offers uncalibrated speeds typically slower than calibrated this control provides range somewhat greater than that consecutive calibrated steps making any speed available between extremes holdoff control found on some better analog oscilloscopes this varies time holdoff during which sweep circuit ignores triggers provides stable display some repetitive events which some triggers would create confusing displays usually set minimum because longer time decreases number sweeps per second resulting dimmer trace see holdoff for more detailed description vertical sensitivity coupling polarity controls accommodate wide range input amplitudes switch selects calibrated sensitivity vertical deflection another control often front calibrated-selector knob offers continuously-variable sensitivity over limited range from calibrated less-sensitive settings often observed signal offset by steady component only changes are interest switch ac position connects capacitor series with input that passes only changes provided that they are not too slow -- slow would mean visible however when signal has fixed offset interest changes quite slowly input connected directly dc switch position most oscilloscopes offer dc input option for convenience see where zero volts input currently shows on screen many oscilloscopes have third switch position gnd that disconnects input grounds often this case user centers trace with vertical position control better oscilloscopes have polarity selector normally positive input moves trace upward but this permits inverting—positive deflects trace downward horizontal sensitivity control this control found only on more elaborate oscilloscopes offers adjustable sensitivity for external horizontal inputs vertical position control computer model vertical position y offset varying sine way vertical position control moves whole displayed trace up down used set no-input trace exactly on center line graticule but also permits offsetting vertically by limited amount with direct coupling adjustment this control can compensate for limited dc component input horizontal position control computer model horizontal position control from x offset increasing horizontal position control moves display sidewise usually sets left end trace at left edge graticule but can displace whole trace when desired this control also moves x-y mode traces sidewise some instruments can compensate for limited dc component for vertical position dual-trace controls please see dual multiple-trace oscilloscopes below dual-trace controls green trace = y = 30sin01t+05 teal trace = y = 30sin03t each input channel usually has its own set sensitivity coupling position controls although some four-trace oscilloscopes have only minimal controls for their third fourth channels dual-trace oscilloscopes have mode switch select either channel alone both channels some x‑y display which uses second channel for x deflection when both channels are displayed type channel switching can be selected on some oscilloscopes on others type depends upon timebase setting if manually selectable channel switching can be free-running asynchronous between consecutive sweeps some philips dual-trace analog oscilloscopes had fast analog multiplier provided display product input channels multiple-trace oscilloscopes have switch for each channel enable disable display that trace's signal delayed-sweep controls please see delayed sweep below these include controls for delayed-sweep timebase which calibrated often also variable slowest speed several steps faster than slowest main sweep speed although fastest generally same calibrated multiturn delay time control offers wide range high resolution delay settings spans full duration main sweep its reading corresponds graticule divisions but with much finer precision its accuracy also superior that display switch selects display modes main sweep only with brightened region showing when delayed sweep advancing delayed sweep only on some combination mode good crt oscilloscopes include delayed-sweep intensity control allow for dimmer trace much-faster delayed sweep that nevertheless occurs only once per main sweep such oscilloscopes also are likely have trace separation control for multiplexed display both main delayed sweeps together sweep trigger controls please see triggered sweep below switch selects trigger source can be external input one vertical channels dual multiple-trace oscilloscope ac line mains frequency another switch enables disables auto trigger mode selects single sweep if provided oscilloscope either spring-return switch position pushbutton arms single sweeps level control varies voltage on waveform which generates trigger slope switch selects positive-going negative-going polarity at selected trigger level basic types sweep triggered sweep type tektronix oscilloscope this was popular analog oscilloscope portable representative example display events with unchanging slowly visibly changing waveforms but occurring at times that may not be evenly spaced modern oscilloscopes have triggered sweeps compared simpler oscilloscopes with sweep oscillators that are always running triggered-sweep oscilloscopes are markedly more versatile triggered sweep starts at selected point on signal providing stable display this way triggering allows display periodic signals such sine waves square waves well nonperiodic signals such single pulses pulses that do not recur at fixed rate with triggered sweeps scope will blank beam start reset sweep circuit each time beam reaches extreme right side screen for period time called holdoff extendable by front-panel control on some better oscilloscopes sweep circuit resets completely ignores triggers once holdoff expires next trigger starts sweep trigger event usually input waveform reaching some user-specified threshold voltage trigger level specified direction going positive going negative—trigger polarity some cases variable holdoff time can be really useful make sweep ignore interfering triggers that occur before events be observed case repetitive but complex waveforms variable holdoff can create stable display that cannot otherwise be achieved holdoff trigger holdoff defines certain period following trigger during which scope will not trigger again this makes easier establish stable view waveform with multiple edges which would otherwise cause another trigger example imagine following repeating waveform green line waveform red vertical partial line represents location trigger yellow line represents trigger level if scope was simply set trigger on every rising edge this waveform would cause three triggers for each cycle assuming signal fairly high frequency scope would probably look something like this except that on scope each trigger would be same channel so would be same color desired set scope only trigger on one edge per cycle so necessary set holdoff be slightly less than period waveform that will prevent from triggering more than once per cycle but still allow trigger on first edge next cycle automatic sweep mode triggered sweeps can display blank screen if there are no triggers avoid this these sweeps include timing circuit that generates free-running triggers so trace always visible once triggers arrive timer stops providing pseudo-triggers automatic sweep mode can be de-selected when observing low repetition rates recurrent sweeps if input signal periodic sweep repetition rate can be adjusted display few cycles waveform early tube oscilloscopes lowest-cost oscilloscopes have sweep oscillators that run continuously are uncalibrated such oscilloscopes are very simple comparatively inexpensive were useful radio servicing some tv servicing measuring voltage time possible but only with extra equipment quite inconvenient they are primarily qualitative instruments they have few widely spaced frequency ranges relatively wide-range continuous frequency control within given range use sweep frequency set slightly lower than some submultiple input frequency display typically at least two cycles input signal so all details are visible very simple control feeds adjustable amount vertical signal possibly related external signal sweep oscillator signal triggers beam blanking sweep retrace sooner than would occur free-running display becomes stable single sweeps some oscilloscopes offer these—the sweep circuit manually armed typically by pushbutton equivalent armed means it's ready respond trigger once sweep complete resets will not sweep until re-armed this mode combined with oscilloscope camera captures single-shot events types trigger include external trigger pulse from external source connected dedicated input on scope edge trigger edge-detector that generates pulse when input signal crosses specified threshold voltage specified direction these are most-common types triggers level control sets threshold voltage slope control selects direction negative positive-going first sentence description also applies inputs some digital logic circuits those inputs have fixed threshold polarity response video trigger circuit that extracts synchronizing pulses from video formats such pal ntsc triggers timebase on every line specified line every field every frame this circuit typically found waveform monitor device although some better oscilloscopes include this function delayed trigger which waits specified time after edge trigger before starting sweep described under delayed sweeps trigger delay circuit typically main sweep extends this delay known adjustable interval this way operator can examine particular pulse long train pulses some recent designs oscilloscopes include more sophisticated triggering schemes these are described toward end this article delayed sweeps more sophisticated analog oscilloscopes contain second timebase for delayed sweep delayed sweep provides very detailed look at some small selected portion main timebase main timebase serves controllable delay after which delayed timebase starts this can start when delay expires can be triggered only after delay expires ordinarily delayed timebase set for faster sweep sometimes much faster such at extreme ratios jitter delays on consecutive main sweeps degrades display but delayed-sweep triggers can overcome that display shows vertical signal one several modes main timebase delayed timebase only combination thereof when delayed sweep active main sweep trace brightens while delayed sweep advancing one combination mode provided only on some oscilloscopes trace changes from main sweep delayed sweep once delayed sweep starts although less delayed fast sweep visible for longer delays another combination mode multiplexes alternates main delayed sweeps so that both appear at once trace separation control displaces them dsos allow waveforms be displayed this way without offering delayed timebase such dual multiple-trace oscilloscopes oscilloscopes with two vertical inputs referred dual-trace oscilloscopes are extremely useful commonplace using single-beam crt they multiplex inputs usually switching between them fast enough display two traces apparently at once less common are oscilloscopes with more traces four inputs are common among these but few kikusui for one offered display sweep trigger signal if desired some multi-trace oscilloscopes use external trigger input optional vertical input some have third fourth channels with only minimal controls all cases inputs when independently displayed are time-multiplexed but dual-trace oscilloscopes often can add their inputs display real-time analog sum inverting one channel provides difference provided that neither channel overloaded this difference mode can provide moderate-performance differential input switching channels can be asynchronous that free-running with trace blanking while switching after each horizontal sweep complete asynchronous switching usually designated chopped while sweep-synchronized designated alt given channel alternately connected disconnected leading term chopped multi-trace oscilloscopes also switch channels either chopped alternate modes general chopped mode better for slower sweeps possible for internal chopping rate be multiple sweep repetition rate creating blanks traces but practice this rarely problem gaps one trace are overwritten by traces following sweep few oscilloscopes had modulated chopping rate avoid this occasional problem alternate mode however better for faster sweeps true dual-beam crt oscilloscopes did exist but were not common one type cossor uk had beam-splitter plate its crt single-ended deflection following splitter others had two complete electron guns requiring tight control axial rotational mechanical alignment manufacturing crt beam-splitter types had horizontal deflection common both vertical channels but dual-gun oscilloscopes could have separate time bases use one time base for both channels multiple-gun crts up ten guns were made past decades with ten guns envelope bulb was cylindrical throughout its length also see crt invention oscilloscope history vertical amplifier analog oscilloscope vertical amplifier acquires signal be displayed better oscilloscopes delays them by fraction microsecond provides signal large enough deflect crt's beam that deflection at least somewhat beyond edges graticule more typically some distance off-screen amplifier has have low distortion display its input accurately must be linear has recover quickly from overloads well its time-domain response has represent transients accurately—minimal overshoot rounding tilt flat pulse top vertical input goes frequency-compensated step attenuator reduce large signals prevent overload attenuator feeds low-level stage few which turn feed gain stages delay-line driver if there delay following are more gain stages up final output stage which develops large signal swing tens volts sometimes over volts for crt electrostatic deflection dual multiple-trace oscilloscopes internal electronic switch selects relatively low-level output one channel's amplifiers sends following stages vertical amplifier which only single channel so speak from that point on free-running chopped mode oscillator which may be simply different operating mode switch driver blanks beam before switching unblanks only after switching transients have settled part way through amplifier feed sweep trigger circuits for internal triggering from signal this feed would be from individual channel's amplifier dual multi-trace oscilloscope channel depending upon setting trigger source selector this feed precedes delay if there one which allows sweep circuit unblank crt start forward sweep so crt can show triggering event high-quality analog delays add modest cost oscilloscope are omitted oscilloscopes that are cost-sensitive delay itself comes from special cable with pair conductors wound around flexible magnetically soft core coiling provides distributed inductance while conductive layer close wires provides distributed capacitance combination wideband transmission line with considerable delay per unit length both ends delay cable require matched impedances avoid reflections x-y mode 24-hour clock displayed on crt oscilloscope configured x-y mode vector monitor with dual r2r dacs generate analog voltages most modern oscilloscopes have several inputs for voltages thus can be used plot one varying voltage versus another this especially useful for graphing i-v curves current versus voltage characteristics for components such diodes well lissajous patterns lissajous figures are example how oscilloscope can be used track phase differences between multiple input signals this very frequently used broadcast engineering plot left right stereophonic channels ensure that stereo generator calibrated properly historically stable lissajous figures were used show that two sine waves had relatively simple frequency relationship numerically-small ratio they also indicated phase difference between two sine waves same frequency x-y mode also allows oscilloscope be used vector monitor display images user interfaces many early games such tennis for two used oscilloscope output device complete loss signal x-y crt display means that beam strikes small spot which risks burning phosphor older phosphors burned more easily some dedicated x-y displays reduce beam current greatly blank display entirely if there are no inputs present bandwidth with all practical instruments oscilloscopes do not respond equally all possible input frequencies range frequencies oscilloscope can usefully display referred its bandwidth bandwidth applies primarily y-axis although x-axis sweeps have be fast enough show highest-frequency waveforms bandwidth defined frequency at which sensitivity that at dc lowest ac frequency drop db oscilloscope's response will drop off rapidly input frequency raised above that point within stated bandwidth response will not necessarily be exactly uniform flat but should always fall within db range one source states that there noticeable effect on accuracy voltage measurements at only percent stated bandwidth some oscilloscopes' specifications do include narrower tolerance range within stated bandwidth probes also have bandwidth limits must be chosen used properly handle frequencies interest achieve flattest response most probes must be compensated adjustment performed using test signal from oscilloscope allow for reactance probe's cable another related specification rise time this duration fastest pulse that can be resolved by scope related bandwidth approximately by bandwidth hz x rise time seconds = for example oscilloscope intended resolve pulses with rise time nanosecond would have bandwidth mhz analog instruments bandwidth oscilloscope limited by vertical amplifiers crt other display subsystem digital instruments sampling rate analog digital converter adc factor but stated analog bandwidth therefore overall bandwidth instrument usually less than adc's nyquist frequency this due limitations analog signal amplifier deliberate design anti-aliasing filter that precedes adc both for digital oscilloscope rule thumb that continuous sampling rate should be ten times highest frequency desired resolve for example megasample/second rate would be applicable for measuring signals up about megahertz this allows anti-aliasing filter be designed with db down point mhz effective cutoff at mhz nyquist frequency avoiding artifacts very steep brick-wall filter sampling oscilloscope can display signals considerably higher frequency than sampling rate if signals are exactly nearly repetitive does this by taking one sample from each successive repetition input waveform each sample being at increased time interval from trigger event waveform then displayed from these collected samples this mechanism referred equivalent-time sampling some oscilloscopes can operate either this mode more traditional real-time mode at operator's choice other features computer model sweep oscilloscope some oscilloscopes have cursors which are lines that can be moved about screen measure time interval between two points difference between two voltages few older oscilloscopes simply brightened trace at movable locations these cursors are more accurate than visual estimates referring graticule lines better quality general purpose oscilloscopes include calibration signal for setting up compensation test probes this often khz square-wave signal definite peak-to-peak voltage available at test terminal on front panel some better oscilloscopes also have squared-off loop for checking adjusting current probes sometimes event that user wants see may only happen occasionally catch these events some oscilloscopes known storage scopes preserve most recent sweep on screen this was originally achieved by using special crt storage tube which would retain image even very brief event for long time some digital oscilloscopes can sweep at speeds slow once per hour emulating strip chart recorder that signal scrolls across screen from right left most oscilloscopes with this facility switch from sweep strip-chart mode at about one sweep per ten seconds this because otherwise scope looks broken it's collecting data but dot cannot be seen current oscilloscopes digital signal sampling more often used for all but simplest models samples feed fast analog-to-digital converters following which all signal processing storage digital many oscilloscopes have different plug-in modules for different purposes eg high-sensitivity amplifiers relatively narrow bandwidth differential amplifiers amplifiers with four more channels sampling plugins for repetitive signals very high frequency special-purpose plugins including audio/ultrasonic spectrum analyzers stable-offset-voltage direct-coupled channels with relatively high gain examples use lissajous figures on oscilloscope with degrees phase difference between x y inputs one most frequent uses scopes troubleshooting malfunctioning electronic equipment one advantages scope that can graphically show signals where voltmeter may show totally unexpected voltage scope may reveal that circuit oscillating other cases precise shape timing pulse important piece electronic equipment for example connections between stages eg electronic mixers electronic oscillators amplifiers may be 'probed' for expected signal using scope simple signal tracer if expected signal absent incorrect some preceding stage electronics not operating correctly since most failures occur because single faulty component each measurement can prove that half stages complex piece equipment either work probably did not cause fault once faulty stage found further probing can usually tell skilled technician exactly which component has failed once component replaced unit can be restored service at least next fault can be isolated this sort troubleshooting typical radio tv receivers well audio amplifiers but can apply quite-different devices such electronic motor drives another use check newly designed circuitry very often newly designed circuit will misbehave because design errors bad voltage levels electrical noise etc digital electronics usually operate from clock so dual-trace scope which shows both clock signal test signal dependent upon clock useful storage scopes are helpful for capturing rare electronic events that cause defective operation pictures use heterodyne ac hum on sound sum low-frequency high-frequency signal bad filter on sine dual trace showing different time bases on each
