history digital camera began with eugene f lally jet propulsion laboratory who was thinking about how use mosaic photosensor capture digital images his idea was take pictures planets stars while travelling through space give information about astronauts' position unfortunately with texas instruments employee willis adcock's filmless camera us patent technology had yet catch up with concept steven sasson engineer at eastman kodak invented built first electronic camera using charge-coupled device image sensor earlier ones used camera tube later ones digitized signal early uses were mainly military scientific followed by medical news applications mid late 1990s digital cameras became common among consumers by mid-2000s digital cameras had largely replaced film cameras higher-end cell phones had integrated digital camera by beginning 2010s almost all smartphones had integrated digital camera image sensors further information image sensor two major types digital image sensor are ccd cmos ccd sensor has one amplifier for all pixels while each pixel cmos active-pixel sensor has its own amplifier compared ccds cmos sensors use less power cameras with small sensor use back-side-illuminated cmos bsi-cmos sensor overall final image quality more dependent on image processing capability camera than on sensor type sensor resolution image at left has higher pixel count than one right but has lower spatial resolution resolution digital camera often limited by image sensor that turns light into that discrete signals brighter image at given point on sensor larger value that read for that pixel depending on physical structure sensor color filter array may be used which requires demosaicing recreate full-color image number pixels sensor determines camera's pixel count typical sensor pixel count product number rows number columns for example by pixel sensor would have pixels megapixel methods image capture at heart digital camera ccd cmos image sensor digital camera partly disassembled lens assembly bottom right partially removed but sensor top right still captures image seen on lcd screen bottom left since first digital backs were introduced there have been three main methods capturing image each based on hardware configuration sensor color filters single-shot capture systems use either one sensor chip with bayer filter mosaic three separate image sensors one each for primary additive colors red green blue which are exposed same image via beam splitter see three-ccd camera multi-shot exposes sensor image sequence three more openings lens aperture there are several methods application multi-shot technique most common originally was use single image sensor with three filters passed front sensor sequence obtain additive color information another multiple shot method called microscanning this method uses single sensor chip with bayer filter physically moved sensor on focus plane lens construct higher resolution image than native resolution chip third version combined two methods without bayer filter on chip third method called scanning because sensor moves across focal plane much like sensor image scanner linear tri-linear sensors scanning cameras utilize only single line photosensors three lines for three colors scanning may be accomplished by moving sensor for example when using color co-site sampling by rotating whole camera digital rotating line camera offers images very high total resolution choice method for given capture determined largely by subject matter usually inappropriate attempt capture subject that moves with anything but single-shot system however higher color fidelity larger file sizes resolutions available with multi-shot scanning backs make them attractive for commercial photographers working with stationary subjects large-format photographs improvements single-shot cameras image file processing at beginning 21st century made single shot cameras almost completely dominant even high-end commercial photography filter mosaics interpolation aliasing bayer arrangement color filters on pixel array image sensor most current consumer digital cameras use bayer filter mosaic combination with optical anti-aliasing filter reduce aliasing due reduced sampling different primary-color images demosaicing algorithm used interpolate color information create full array rgb image data cameras that use beam-splitter single-shot 3ccd approach three-filter multi-shot approach color co-site sampling foveon x3 sensor do not use anti-aliasing filters nor demosaicing firmware camera software raw converter program such adobe camera raw interprets raw data from sensor obtain full color image because rgb color model requires three intensity values for each pixel one each for red green blue other color models when used also require three more values per pixel single sensor element cannot simultaneously record these three intensities so color filter array cfa must be used selectively filter particular color for each pixel bayer filter pattern repeating 2x2 mosaic pattern light filters with green ones at opposite corners red blue other two positions high proportion green takes advantage properties human visual system which determines brightness mostly from green far more sensitive brightness than hue saturation sometimes 4-color filter pattern used often involving two different hues green this provides potentially more accurate color but requires slightly more complicated interpolation process color intensity values not captured for each pixel can be interpolated from values adjacent pixels which represent color being calculated sensor size angle view cameras with digital image sensors that are smaller than typical 35mm film size have smaller field angle view when used with lens same focal length this because angle view function both focal length sensor film size used crop factor relative 35mm film format if smaller sensor used most digicams field view cropped by sensor smaller than 35mm full-frame format's field view this narrowing field view may be described crop factor factor by which longer focal length lens would be needed get same field view on 35mm film camera full-frame digital slrs utilize sensor same size frame 35mm film common values for field view crop dslrs using active pixel sensors include 13x for some canon aps-h sensors 15x for sony aps-c sensors used by nikon pentax konica minolta for fujifilm sensors aps-c for most canon sensors ~17x for sigma's foveon sensors 2x for kodak panasonic 4/3-inch sensors

prices capabilities addition general purpose digital cameras specialized cameras including multispectral imaging equipment astrographs are used for scientific military medical other special purposes compacts subcompact with lens assembly retracted disassembled compact digital camera compact cameras are intended be portable pocketable are particularly suitable for casual snapshots many incorporate retractable lens assembly that provides optical zoom most models auto actuating lens cover protects lens from elements most ruggedized water-resistant models do not retract most with superzoom capability do not retract fully compact cameras are usually designed be easy use almost all include automatic mode auto mode which automatically makes all camera settings for user some also have manual controls compact digital cameras typically contain small sensor which trades-off picture quality for compactness simplicity images can usually only be stored using lossy compression jpeg most have built-in flash usually low power sufficient for nearby subjects few high end compact digital cameras have hotshoe for connecting external flash live preview almost always used frame photo on integrated lcd addition being able take still photographs almost all compact cameras have ability record video compacts often have macro capability zoom lenses but zoom range up 30x generally enough for candid photography but less than available on bridge cameras more than 60x interchangeable lenses dslr cameras available at much higher cost autofocus systems compact digital cameras generally are based on contrast-detection methodology using image data from live preview feed main imager some compact digital cameras use hybrid autofocus system similar what commonly available on dslrs some high end travel compact cameras have 30x optical zoom have full manual control with lens ring electronic viewfinder hybrid optical image stabilization built-in flash full hd 60p raw burst shooting up 10fps built-in wi-fi with nfc gps altogether typically compact digital cameras incorporate nearly silent leaf shutter into lens but play simulated camera sound for skeuomorphic purposes for low cost small size these cameras typically use image sensor formats with diagonal between mm corresponding crop factor between this gives them weaker low-light performance greater depth field generally closer focusing ability smaller components than cameras using larger sensors some cameras use larger sensor including at high end pricey full-frame sensor compact camera such sony cyber-shot dsc-rx1 but have capability near that dslr variety additional features are available depending on model camera such features include ones such gps compass barometer altimeter for above mean sea level underwater mean sea level some are rugged waterproof starting some compact digital cameras can take still photos these compact stereo cameras can capture panoramic photos with dual lens even single lens for play back on tv sony released two add-on camera models without display be used with smartphone tablet controlled by mobile application via wifi rugged compacts rugged compact cameras typically include protection against submersion hot cold conditions shock pressure terms used describe such properties include waterproof freezeproof heatproof shockproof crushproof respectively nearly all major camera manufacturers have at least one product this category some are waterproof considerable depth up feet m others only feet 3m but only few will float ruggeds often lack some features ordinary compact camera but they have video capability majority can record sound most have image stabilization built-in flash touchscreen lcd gps do not work underwater action cameras for more details on this topic see action camera gopro other brands offer action cameras which are rugged small can be easily attached helmet arm bicycle etc most have wide angle fixed focus can take motion still pictures usually without sound 360-degree cameras 360-degree camera can take picture video degrees using two lenses back-to-back shooting at same time some cameras are ricoh theta s nikon keymission samsung gear

also being water resistant nico360 can be used action camera bridge cameras sony dsc-h2 main article bridge camera bridge cameras physically resemble dslrs are sometimes called dslr-shape dslr-like they provide some similar features but like compacts they use fixed lens small sensor some compact cameras have also psam mode most use live preview frame image their usual autofocus by same contrast-detect mechanism compacts but many bridge cameras have manual focus mode some have separate focus ring for greater control big physical size small sensor allow superzoom wide aperture bridgcams generally include image stabilization system enable longer handheld exposures sometimes better than dslr for low light condition bridge cameras come two principal classes terms sensor size firstly more traditional 1/23 sensor measured by image sensor format which gives more flexibility lens design allows for handholdable zoom from 24mm 35mm equivalent wide angle all way up over mm supertele secondly sensor that allows better image quality particularly low light higher iso but puts greater constraints on lens design resulting zoom lenses that stop at 200mm constant aperture eg sony rx10 400mm variable aperture eg panasonic lumix fz1000 equivalent corresponding optical zoom factor roughly some bridge cameras have lens thread attach accessories such wide-angle telephoto converters well filters such uv circular polarizing filter lens hoods scene composed by viewing display electronic viewfinder evf most have slightly longer shutter lag than dslr many these cameras can store images raw format addition supporting jpeg majority have built-in flash but only few have hotshoe bright sun quality difference between good compact camera digital slr minimal but bridge cameras are more portable cost less have greater zoom ability thus bridge camera may better suit outdoor daytime activities except when seeking professional-quality photos mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras main article mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera late new type camera emerged called mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera milc which uses various sensors offers lens interchangeability these are simpler more compact than dslrs due not having lens reflex system milc camera models are available with various sensor sizes including small 1/23 inch sensor commonly used bridge cameras such original pentax q more recent pentax q versions have slightly larger 1/17 inch sensor inch sensor micro four thirds sensor aps-c sensor such sony nex series fujifilm x series pentax k-01 canon eos m some such sony alpha use full frame mm sensor even hasselblad x1d first medium format milc disadvantage milc over dslr battery energy consume due high energy consume electronic viewfinder olympus panasonic released many micro four thirds cameras with interchangeable lenses which are fully compatible each other without any adapter while others have proprietary mounts kodak released its first micro four third system camera march milc cameras are available which appeal both amateurs professionals modular cameras while most digital cameras with interchangeable lenses feature lens-mount some kind there are also number modular cameras where shutter sensor are incorporated into lens module first such modular camera was minolta dimâge v followed by minolta dimâge ex minolta metaflash ricoh released ricoh gxr modular camera at ces sakar international announced polaroid im1836 mp camera with 1-sensor with interchangeable sensor-lens adapter for micro four thirds nikon k-mount lenses was planned ship with camera there are also number add-on camera modules for smartphones called lens-style cameras lens camera they contain all components digital camera module but lack viewfinder display most controls instead they can be mounted smartphone use its display controls lens-style cameras include sony smartshot qx series announced released mid january announced firmware update for

part lens part all micro four thirds system lenses can be attached sensor part lens camera digital single-lens reflex cameras cutaway olympus e-30 dslr main article digital single-lens reflex camera digital single-lens reflex cameras dslr use reflex mirror that can reflect light also can swivel from one position another position back initial position by default reflex mirror set degree from horizontal blocks light sensor reflects light from lens penta-mirror/prism at dslr camera after some reflections arrives at viewfinder reflex mirror pulled out horizontally below penta-mirror/prism when shutter release fully pressed so viewfinder will be dark light/image can directly strike sensor at time exposure speed setting autofocus accomplished using sensors mirror box some dslrs have live view mode that allows framing using screen with image from sensor these cameras have much larger sensors than other types typically mm mm on diagonal crop factor larger sensor permits more light be received by each pixel this combined with relatively large lenses provides superior low-light performance for same field view same aperture larger sensor gives shallower focus they use interchangeable lenses for versatility usually some lenses are made for digital slr use only but recent trend lenses can also be used detachable lens video camera with without adapter digital single lens translucent dslt cameras main article sony slt camera dslt uses fixed translucent mirror instead moving reflex mirror dslr translucent mirror transmissive mirror semi-transparent mirror mirror which reflects light two things at same time reflects along path pentaprism/pentamirror which then goes optical view finder ovf done with reflex mirror dslr cameras translucent mirror also sends light along second path sensor total amount light not changed just some light travels one path some travels other consequences are that dslt cameras should shoot half stop differently from dsl one advantage using dslt camera blind moments dslr user experiences while reflecting mirror moved send light sensor instead viewfinder do not exist for dslt cameras because there no time at which light not traveling along both paths dslt cameras get benefit continuous auto-focus tracking this especially beneficial for burst mode shooting low-light conditions also for tracking when taking video until early only sony had released dslt cameras by march sony had released more dslts than dslrs with relatively complete lenses line-up digital rangefinders main article rangefinder camera § digital rangefinder rangefinder device measure subject distance with intent adjust focus camera's objective lens accordingly open-loop controller rangefinder lens focusing mechanism may may not be coupled common parlance term rangefinder camera interpreted very narrowly denote manual-focus cameras with visually-read out optical rangefinder based on parallax most digital cameras achieve focus through analysis image captured by objective lens distance estimation if provided at all only byproduct focusing process closed-loop controller line-scan camera systems line-scan camera traditionally has single row pixel sensors instead matrix them lines are continuously fed computer that joins them each other makes image this most commonly done by connecting camera output frame grabber which resides pci slot industrial computer frame grabber acts buffer image sometimes provide some processing before delivering computer software for processing multiple rows sensors may be used make colored images increase sensitivity by tdi time delay integration many industrial applications require wide field view traditionally maintaining consistent light over large areas quite difficult with line scan camera all that necessary provide even illumination across “line” currently being viewed by camera this makes possible sharp pictures objects that pass camera at high speed such cameras are also commonly used make photo finishes determine winner when multiple competitors cross finishing line at nearly same time they can also be used industrial instruments for analyzing fast processes linescan cameras are also

computer transfer data- early cameras used pc serial port usb now most widely used method most cameras are viewable usb mass storage though some have firewire port some cameras use usb ptp mode for connection instead usb msc some offer both modes other cameras use wireless connections via bluetooth ieee wi-fi such kodak easyshare one wi-fi integrated memory cards sdhc sdxc can transmit stored images video other files computers smartphones mobile operating systems such android allow automatic upload backup sharing images over wi-fi photo sharing cloud services cameras with integrated wi-fi specific wi-fi adapters mostly allow camera control especially shutter release exposure control more tethering from computer smartphone apps additionally transfer media data cameraphones some high-end stand-alone digital cameras also use cellular networks connect for sharing images most common standard on cellular networks mms multimedia messaging service commonly called picture messaging second method with smartphones send picture email attachment many old cameraphones however do not support email common alternative use card reader which may be capable reading several types storage media well high speed transfer data computer use card reader also avoids draining camera battery during download process external card reader allows convenient direct access images on collection storage media but if only one storage card use moving back forth between camera reader can be inconvenient many computers have card reader built at least for sd cards printing photos many modern cameras support pictbridge standard which allows them send data directly pictbridge-capable computer printer without need for computer wireless connectivity can also provide for printing photos without cable connection polaroid has introduced printer integrated into its digital camera which creates small printed copy photo this reminiscent original instant camera popularized by polaroid displaying photos

new technology for sending video from mobile devices television digital form mhl sends pictures video stream up 1080p resolution compatible with hdmi some dvd recorders television sets can read memory cards used cameras alternatively several types flash card readers have tv output capability weather-sealing waterproofing cameras can be equipped with varying amount environmental sealing provide protection against splashing water moisture humidity fog dust sand complete waterproofness certain depth for certain duration latter one approaches allow underwater photography other approach being use waterproof housings many waterproof digital cameras are also shockproof resistant low temperatures modes many digital cameras have preset modes for different applications within constraints correct exposure various parameters can be changed including exposure aperture focusing light metering white balance equivalent sensitivity for example portrait might use wider aperture render background out focus would seek out focus on human face rather than other image content image data storage compactflash cf card one many media types used store digital photographs many camera phones most stand alone digital cameras store image data flash memory cards other removable media most stand-alone cameras use sd format while few use compactflash other types january faster xqd card format was announced early some high end cameras have two hot-swapable memory slots photographers can swap one memory card with camera-on each memory slot can accept either compact flash sd card all new sony cameras also have two memory slots one for its memory stick one for sd card but not hot-swapable few cameras used other removable storage such microdrives very small hard disk drives cd single mb floppy disks other unusual formats include onboard flash memory — cheap cameras cameras secondary device's main use such camera phone pc card hard drives — early professional cameras discontinued thermal printer — known only one model camera that printed images immediately rather than storing mini cd left microdrive cf-ii usb flash drive floppy disks most manufacturers digital cameras do not provide drivers software allow their cameras work with linux other free software still many cameras use standard usb storage protocol are thus easily usable other cameras are supported by gphoto project file formats main article image file formats joint photography experts group standard jpeg most common file format for storing image data other file types include tagged image file format tiff various raw image formats many cameras especially high-end ones support raw image format raw image unprocessed set pixel data directly from camera's sensor often saved proprietary format adobe systems has released dng format royalty-free raw image format used by at least camera manufacturers raw files initially had be processed specialized image editing programs but over time many mainstream editing programs such google's picasa have added support for raw images rendering standard images from raw sensor data allows more flexibility making major adjustments without losing image quality retaking picture formats for movies are avi dv mpeg mov often containing motion jpeg wmv asf basically same wmv recent formats include mp4 which based on quicktime format uses newer compression algorithms allow longer recording times same space other formats that are used cameras but not for pictures are design rule for camera format dcf iso specification used almost all camera since which defines internal file structure naming also used digital print order format dpof which dictates what order images are be printed how many copies dcf defines logical file system with filenames makes

aperture exposure time focal length date time taken location batteries digital cameras have become smaller over time resulting ongoing need develop battery small enough fit camera yet able power for reasonable length time digital cameras utilize either proprietary standard consumer batteries march most cameras use proprietary lithium-ion batteries while some use standard aa batteries primarily use proprietary lithium-ion rechargeable battery pack but have optional aa battery holder available proprietary most common class battery used digital cameras proprietary battery formats these are built manufacturer's custom specifications almost all proprietary batteries are lithium-ion addition being available from oem aftermarket replacement batteries are commonly available for most camera

intended for single use rechargeable rcr-v3 lithium-ion batteries are also available alternative non-rechargeable cr-v3 batteries some battery grips for dslrs come with separate holder accommodate aa cells external power source conversion film cameras digital digital single-lens reflex camera when digital cameras became common many photographers asked whether their film cameras could be converted digital answer was yes no for majority mm film cameras answer no reworking cost would be too great especially lenses have been evolving well cameras for most conversion digital give enough space for electronics allow liquid crystal display preview would require removing back camera replacing with custom built digital unit many early professional slr cameras such kodak dcs series were developed from mm film cameras technology time however meant that rather than being digital backs bodies these cameras were mounted on large bulky digital units often bigger than camera portion itself these were factory built cameras however not aftermarket conversions notable exception nikon e2 nikon e3 using additional optics convert 35mm format 2/3 ccd-sensor few mm cameras have had digital camera backs made by their manufacturer leica being notable example medium format large format cameras those using film stock greater than mm have low unit production typical digital backs for them cost over $10000 these cameras also tend be highly modular with handgrips film backs winders lenses available separately fit various needs very large sensor these backs use leads enormous image sizes for example phase one's p45 mp image back creates single tiff image size up mb even greater pixel counts are available medium format digitals such this are geared more towards studio portrait photography than their smaller dslr counterparts iso speed particular tends have maximum versus for some dslr cameras canon eos-1d mark iv nikon d3s have iso plus hi-3 iso with canon eos-1dx's iso digital camera backs main article digital camera back industrial high-end professional photography market some camera systems use modular removable image sensors for example some medium format slr cameras such mamiya series allow installation either digital camera back traditional photographic film back area array o ccd o cmos linear array o ccd monochrome o 3-strip ccd with color filters linear array cameras are also called scan backs single-shot multi-shot three-shot usually most earlier digital camera backs used linear array sensors moving vertically digitize image many them only capture grayscale images relatively long exposure times range seconds even minutes generally limit scan backs studio applications where all aspects photographic scene are under photographer's control some other camera backs use ccd arrays similar typical cameras these are called single-shot backs since much easier manufacture high-quality linear ccd array with only thousands pixels than ccd matrix with millions very high resolution linear ccd camera backs were available much earlier than their ccd matrix counterparts for example you could buy albeit expensive camera back with over pixel horizontal resolution mid-1990s however still difficult buy comparable ccd matrix camera same resolution rotating line cameras with about color pixels its sensor line are able capture about lines during one full degree rotation thereby creating single digital image megapixels most modern digital camera backs use ccd cmos matrix sensors matrix sensor captures entire image frame at once instead incrementing scanning frame area through prolonged exposure for example phase one produces million pixel digital camera back with x mm ccd this ccd array little smaller than frame film much larger than mm frame x mm comparison consumer digital cameras use arrays ranging from x mm full frame on high end consumer dslrs x mm on camera phones cmos sensor see also image stabilization smart camera digital signal
