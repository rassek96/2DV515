devices o mechanical accessories o other o obsolete standard symbols see also references classification components can be classified passive active electromechanic strict physics definition treats passive components ones that cannot supply energy themselves whereas battery would be seen active component since truly acts source energy however electronic engineers who perform circuit analysis use more restrictive definition passivity when only concerned with energy signals convenient ignore so-called dc circuit pretend that power supplying components such transistors integrated circuits absent if each such component had its own battery built though may reality be supplied by dc circuit then analysis only concerns ac circuit abstraction that ignores dc voltages currents power associated with them present real-life circuit this fiction for instance lets us view oscillator producing energy even though reality oscillator consumes even more energy from dc power supply which we have chosen ignore under that restriction we define terms used circuit analysis active components rely on source energy usually from dc circuit which we have chosen ignore usually can inject power into circuit though this not part definition active components include amplifying components such transistors triode vacuum tubes valves tunnel diodes passive components can't introduce net energy into circuit they also can't rely on source power except for what available from ac circuit they are connected consequence they can't amplify increase power signal although they may increase voltage current such done by transformer resonant circuit passive components include two-terminal components such resistors capacitors inductors transformers electromechanical components can carry out electrical operations by using moving parts by using electrical connections most passive components with more than two terminals can be described terms two-port parameters that satisfy principle reciprocity
