online games most popular type mmog subgenre that pioneered category massively multiplayer online role-playing game mmorpg which descended from university mainframe computer mud adventure games such rogue dungeon on pdp-10 these games predate commercial gaming industry internet but still featured persistent worlds other elements mmogs still used today first graphical mmog major milestone creation genre was multiplayer flight combat simulation game air warrior by kesmai on genie online service which first appeared kesmai later added graphics game making first mmo commercial mmorpgs gained acceptance late 1980s early 1990s genre was pioneered by gemstone series on genie also created by kesmai neverwinter nights first such game include graphics which debuted on aol video game developers applied mmog ideas other computer video game genres new acronyms started develop such mmorts mmog emerged generic term cover this growing class games debuts realm online meridian first mmorpg ultima online underlight everquest late 1990s popularized mmorpg genre growth technology meant that where neverwinter nights had been limited simultaneous players number that grew by by year multitude mmorpgs were each serving thousands simultaneous players led way for games such world warcraft eve online despite genre's focus on multiplayer gaming ai-controlled characters are still common npcs mobs who give out quests serve opponents are typical mmorpgs ai-controlled characters are not common action-based mmogs popularity mmogs was mostly restricted computer game market until sixth-generation consoles with launch phantasy star online on dreamcast emergence growth online service xbox live there have been number console mmogs including everquest online adventures playstation multiconsole final fantasy xi on pcs mmog market has always been dominated by successful fantasy mmorpgs mmogs have only recently begun break into mobile phone market first samurai romanesque set feudal japan was released on ntt docomo's imode network japan more recent developments are cipsoft's tibiame biting bit's micromonster which features online bluetooth multiplayer gaming smartcell technology development shadow legend which will allow gamers continue their game on their mobile device when away from their pc science fiction has also been popular theme featuring games such mankind anarchy online eve online star wars galaxies matrix online mmogs emerged from hard-core gamer community mainstream strongly december with analysis financial times measuring value virtual property then-largest mmog everquest result per-capita gdp dollars which would have placed virtual world everquest 77th wealthiest nation on par with croatia ecuador tunisia vietnam world warcraft dominant mmog with 8-9 million monthly subscribers worldwide subscriber base dropped by million after expansion wrath lich king bringing million subscribers though remained most popular western title among mmogs western consumer spending on world warcraft represented 58% share subscription mmog market title has generated over $22 billion cumulative consumer spending on subscriptions from through virtual economies main article virtual economy within majority mmogs created there virtual currency where player can earn accumulate money uses for such virtual currency are numerous vary from game game virtual economies created within mmogs often blur lines between real virtual worlds result often seen unwanted interaction between real virtual economies by players provider virtual world this practice economy interaction mostly seen this genre games two seem come hand hand with even earliest mmogs such ultima online having this kind trade real money for virtual things importance having working virtual economy within mmog increasing they develop sign this ccp games hiring first real-life economist for its mmog eve online assist analyze virtual economy production within this game results this interaction between virtual economy our real economy which really interaction between company that created game third-party companies that want share profits success game this battle between companies defended on both sides company originating game intellectual property argue that this violation terms agreements game well copyright violation since they own rights how online currency distributed through what channels case that third-party companies their customers defend that they are selling exchanging time effort put into acquisition currency not digital information itself they also express that nature many mmogs that they require time commitments not available everyone result without external acquisition virtual currency some players are severely limited being able experience certain aspects game practice acquiring large volumes virtual currency for purpose selling other individuals for tangible real currency called gold farming many players who have poured all their personal effort resent that there this exchange between real virtual economies since devalues their own efforts result term 'gold farmer' now has very negative connotation within games their communities this slander has unfortunately also extended itself racial profiling in-game forum insulting reaction from many game companies varies games that are substantially less popular have small player base enforcement elimination 'gold farming' appears less often companies this situation most likely are concerned with their personal sales subscription revenue over development their virtual economy they most likely have higher priority games viability via adequate funding games with enormous player base consequently much higher sales subscription income can take more drastic actions more often much larger volumes this account banning could also serve economic gain for these large games since highly likely that due demand these 'gold farming' accounts will be recreated with freshly bought copies game virtual goods revenue from online games social networking exceeded us$7 billion was estimated that up people china vietnam are playing online games gather gold other items for sale western players however single player mmos quite viable especially what called 'player vs environment' gameplay this may result player being unable experience all content many most significant potentially rewarding game experiences are events which require large coordinated teams complete most mmogs also share other characteristics that make them different from other multiplayer online games mmogs host large number players single game world all those players can interact with each other at any given time popular mmogs might have thousands players online at any given time usually on company owned servers non-mmogs such battlefield half-life usually have fewer than players online per server are usually played on private servers also mmogs usually do not have any significant mods since game must work on company servers there some debate if high head-count requirement be mmog some say that size game world its capability support large number players that should matter for example despite technology content constraints most mmogs can fit up few thousand players on single game server at time support all those players mmogs need large-scale game worlds servers connect players those worlds some games have all their servers connected so all players are connected shared universe others have copies their starting game world put on different servers called shards for sharded universe shards got their name from ultima online where story shards mondain's gem created duplicate worlds still others will only use one part universe at any time for example tribes which not mmog comes with number large maps which are played rotation one at time contrast similar title planetside allows all map-like areas game be reached via flying driving teleporting mmorpgs usually have sharded universes they provide most flexible solution server load problem but not always for example space simulation eve online uses only one large cluster server peaking at over simultaneous players technical aspect challenging develop database engines that are needed run successful mmog with millions players many developers have created their own but attempts have been made create middleware software that would help game developers concentrate on their games more than technical aspects one such piece middleware called bigworld early successful entry into field was vr-1 entertainment whose conductor platform was adopted endorsed by variety service providers around world including sony communications network japan bertelsmann game channel germany british telecom's wireplay england dacom samsung sds south korea games that were powered by conductor platform included fighter wing air attack fighter ace evernight hasbro em@ail games clue nascar soccer towers fallow sarac project vr1 crossroads rumble void typical muds other predecessor games were limited about simultaneous player connections this was limit imposed by underlying operating system which was usually unix-like one bigger problems with modern engines has been handling vast number players since typical server can handle around 10000–12000 players 4000–5000 active simultaneously dividing game into several servers has up until now been solution this approach has also helped with technical issues such lag that many players experience another difficulty especially relevant real-time simulation games time synchronization across hundreds thousands players many games rely on time synchronization drive their physics simulation well their scoring damage detection game types there are several types massively multiplayer online games role-playing group photo linkshell guild roleplaying game final fantasy xi main article massively multiplayer online role-playing game see also list mmorpgs massively multiplayer online role-playing games known mmorpgs are most common type mmog some mmorpgs are designed multiplayer browser game order reduce infrastructure costs utilise thin client that most users will already have installed acronym bbmmorpgs has sometimes been used describe these browser-based bulletin board role-playing games large number games are categorized mmobbgs massively

article massively multiplayer online first-person shooter game see also list mmofpss mmofps online gaming genre which features large number simultaneous players first-person shooter fashion these games provide large-scale sometimes team-based combat addition persistence game world means that these games add elements typically found rpgs such experience points however mmofps games emphasize player skill more than player statistics no number in-game bonuses will compensate for player's inability aim think tactically real-time strategy main article massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game see also list mmortss massively multiplayer online real-time strategy games also known mmorts combine real-time strategy rts with persistent world players often assume role general king other type figurehead leading army into battle while maintaining resources needed for such warfare titles are often based sci-fi fantasy universe are distinguished from single small-scale multiplayer rtses by number players common use persistent world generally hosted by game's publisher which continues evolve even when player offline turn-based strategy steve jackson games' ultracorps example mmo turn-based strategy game hundreds players share same playing field conquest mega game each turn fleets are built launched expand one's personal empire turns are usually time-based with tick schedule usually daily all orders are processed battles resolved at same time during tick similarly darkwind war on wheels vehicle driving combat orders are submitted simultaneously by all players tick occurs typically once per seconds this allows each player accurately control multiple vehicles pedestrians racing combat simulations world war ii online simulation game showing numbers players during special event june some people had spawned for this gathering this location game some mmogs have been designed accurately simulate certain aspects real world they tend be very specific industries activities very large risk huge potential loss such rocket science airplanes trucks battle tanks submarines etc gradually simulation technology getting more mainstream so too various simulators arrive into more mundane industries initial goal world war ii online was create map north western europe that had real world physics gravity air/water resistance etc ability for players have some strategic abilities its basic fps/rpg role while current version not quite true simulated world very complex contains large persistent world mmog genre air traffic simulation one example with networks such vatsim ivao striving provide rigorously authentic flight-simulation environments players both pilot air traffic controller roles this category mmogs objective create duplicates real world for people who cannot do not wish undertake those experiences real life for example flight simulation via mmog requires far less expenditure time money completely risk-free far less restrictive fewer regulations adhere no medical exams pass so on another specialist area mobile telecoms operator carrier business where billion-dollar investments networks are needed but marketshares are won lost on issues from segmentation handset subsidies specialist simulation was developed by nokia called equilibrium/arbitrage have over two-day period five teams top management one operator/carrier play wargame against each other under extremely realistic conditions with one operator incumbent fixed mobile network operator another new entrant mobile operator third fixed-line/internet operator etc each team measured by outperforming their rivals by market expectations that type player thus each player has drastically different goals but within simulation any one team can win also ensure maximum intensity only one team can win telecoms senior executives who have taken equilibrium/arbitrage simulation say most intense most useful training they have ever experienced typical business use simulators very senior management training/retraining other online simulation games include war thunder motor city online sims online jumpgate sports massively multiplayer online sports game title where players can compete some more traditional major league sports such football soccer basketball baseball hockey golf american football according gamespotcom baseball mogul online was world's first massively multiplayer online sports game other titles that qualify mmosg have been around since early 2000s but only after did they start receive endorsements some official major league associations players racing mmor means massively multiplayer online racing currently there are only small number racing-based mmogs including iracing kart rider test drive unlimited project torque drift city race die other notable mmors included upshift strikeracer need for speed world both which have since shut down trackmania series world's largest mmo racing game holds world record for most players single online race although darkwind war on wheels more combat-based than racing also considered mmor casual many types mmo games can be classified casual because they are designed appeal all computer users opposed subgroup frequent game buyers fans another game genre such collectible card games such games are easy learn require smaller time commitment than other game types other popular casual games include

world where players can access puzzles around world most games that are mmopgs are hybrids with other genres castle infinity was first mmog developed for children its gameplay falls somewhere between

alternate reality games args can be massively multiplayer allowing thousands players worldwide co-operate puzzle trails mystery solving args take place unique mixture online real-world play that usually does not involve persistent world are not necessarily multiplayer making them different from mmogs music/rhythm massively multiplayer online music/rhythm games mmorgs sometimes called massively multiplayer online dance games mmodgs are mmogs that are also music video games this idea was influenced by dance dance revolution audition online another casual massively multiplayer online game produced by t3 entertainment just dance has game mode called world dance floor which also structures like mmorpg social massively multiplayer online social games focus on socialization instead objective-based gameplay there great deal overlap terminology with online communities virtual worlds one example that has garnered widespread media attention linden lab's second life emphasizing socializing world-building in-world virtual economy that depends on sale purchase user-created content technically mmosg casual multiplayer online cmo by definition though its stated goal was realize concept metaverse from neal stephenson's novel snow crash instead being based around combat one could say that was based around creation virtual objects including models scripts practice has more common with club caribe than everquest was first mmo its kind achieve widespread success including attention from mainstream media however was not first club caribe was released competitors this subgenre non-combat-based mmorpg include active worlds there smallworlds furcadia whirled imvu many browser based casual mmos have begun spring up this has been made easier because maturing adobe flash popularity club penguin growtopia sims online combat massively multiplayer online combat games are realtime objective strategy capture flag style modes infantry online example multiplayer combat video game with sprite animation graphics using complex soldier ground vehicle space-ship models on typically complex terrains developed by sony online entertainment research some recent attempts build peer-to-peer p2p mmogs have been made outback online may be first commercial one however so far most efforts have been academic studies p2p mmog may potentially be more scalable cheaper build but notable issues with p2p mmogs include security consistency control which can be difficult address given that clients are easily hacked some mmogs such vindictus use p2p networking client-server networking together april united states army announced that was developing massively multiplayer training simulation called awe asymmetric warfare environment purpose awe train soldiers for urban warfare there are no plans for public commercial release forterra systems developing for army based on there engine bonnie nardi published ethnographic study on world warcraft examined with lev vygotsky's activity theory field mmos grows larger each year research has also begun investigate socio-informatic bind games create for their users researchers constance steinkuehler dmitri williams initiated research on such topics topic most intriguing pair was further understand gameplay well virtual world serving social meeting place popular mmos further explore effects social capital social relationships on mmos steinkuehler williams combined conclusions from two different mmo research projects sociocultural perspective on culture cognition other on media effects mmos conclusions two studies explained how mmos function new form third place for informal social interactions much like coffee shops pubs other typical hangouts many scholars however such oldenburg refute idea mmos serving third place due inadequate bridging social capital his argument challenged by putnam who concluded that mmos are well suited for formation bridging social capital tentative relationships that lack depth because inclusive serves sociological lubricant that shown across data collected both research studies mmos can also move past lubricant stage into superglue stage known bonding social capital closer relationship that characterized by stronger connections emotional support study concludes that mmos function best bridging mechanism rather than bonding one similar third place therefore mmos have capacity ability serve community that effectively socializes users just like coffee shop pub but conveniently comfort their own home spending british online gamers are outspending their german french counterparts according recently released study commissioned by gamesindustrycom tns uk mmo-market now worth £195 million compared £165 million £145 million spent by german french online gamers us gamers spend more however spending about $38 billion overall on mmo games $18 billion that money spent on monthly subscription fees money spent averages out $1510 between both
