britain was early computer custom-built play computer game one first games developed early history video games twelve-by-nine-by-five-foot 37-by-27-by-15-metre computer designed by john bennett built by engineer raymond stuart-williams allowed exhibition attendees play game nim against artificial intelligence player pressed buttons on raised panel corresponding with lights on machine select their moves nimrod moved afterwards with its calculations represented by more lights speed nimrod's calculations could be slowed down allow presenter demonstrate exactly what computer was doing with more lights showing state calculations nimrod was intended demonstrate ferranti's computer design programming skills rather than entertain though festival attendees were more interested playing game than logic behind after its initial exhibition may nimrod was shown for three weeks october at berlin industrial show before being dismantled game nim running on nimrod candidate for one first video games was one first computer games have any sort visual display game appeared only four years after invention cathode-ray tube amusement device earliest known interactive electronic game use electronic display one year after bertie brain computer similar nimrod which played tic-tac-toe at canadian national exhibition nimrod's use lightbulbs rather than screen with real-time visual graphics however much less moving graphics does not meet some definitions video game contents development presentation references external links development summer united kingdom held festival britain national exhibition held throughout uk promote british contribution science technology industrial design architecture arts commemorate centenary great exhibition british engineering firm nascent computer developer ferranti promised develop exhibit for festival late john bennett australian employee firm recent phd graduate from university cambridge proposed that company create computer that could play game nim nim players take turns removing at least one object from set objects with goal being player who removes last object gameplay options can be modeled mathematically bennett's suggestion was supposedly inspired by earlier nim-playing machine nimatron which had been displayed at new york world's fair nimatron machine had been designed by edward condon constructed by westinghouse electric from electromechanical relays had weighed over ton although bennett's suggestion was game his goal was show off computer's ability do mathematical calculations nim based on mathematical principles thus showcase ferranti's computer design programming skills rather than entertain may appear that trying make machines play games we are wasting our time this not true theory games extremely complex machine that can play complex game can also be programmed carry out very complex practical problems “ ” pamphlet accompanying nimrod sold festival britain attendees ferranti began work on building computer on december with engineer raymond stuart-williams adapting design by bennett into working machine development was completed by april resulting device twelve feet wide nine feet deep five feet tall majority volume was taken up by vacuum tubes lightbulbs that displayed state game with actual computer taking up no more than two percent total volume machine nimrod took form large box with panels lights with raised stand front with buttons corresponding with lights which turn represented objects player could remove player would sit at stand press buttons make their moves while one panel lights showed state game another showed computer's calculations during its move computer could be set make its calculations at various speeds slowing down so that demonstrator could describe exactly what computer was doing real time visual guide attached nimrod explained what computer was doing during its turn well showing possible game states how they would be represented by lights signs stating which player's turn was whether one other had won would light up appropriate during gameplay presentation diagram machine on may nimrod computer was presented at festival nimrod digital computer advertised faster than thought electronic brain exclusively played game nim moves were made by players seated at raised stand with demonstrator sitting on other side between stand computer nimrod could play either traditional reverse form game short guidebook was sold visitors for one shilling sixpence explaining how computers worked how nimrod worked advertising ferranti's other developments explained that use game demonstrate power machine did not mean that was meant for entertainment compared mathematical underpinnings nim with modeling economics countries players nimrod during festival included computer science pioneer alan turing although was intended technology demonstration most onlookers at festival britain were more interested playing game than programming engineering logic behind bennett claimed that most public were quite happy gawk at flashing lights be impressed bbc radio journalist paul jennings claimed that all festival attendees came standstill upon reaching frightful tremendous gray refrigerator after festival nimrod was showcased for three weeks october at berlin industrial show where also drew crowds including west germany economics minister ludwig erhard afterwards however had served its purpose nimrod was dismantled nimrod was not intended entertainment product was not followed up by any future games ferranti continued its work on designing general purpose computers nimrod was created only four years after invention cathode-ray tube amusement device earliest known interactive electronic game one year after similar purpose built game-playing machine bertie brain first computer-based game feature visual display any sort nimrod considered under some definitions one first video games possibly second while definitions vary prior cathode-ray tube amusement device was purely analog electrical game while nimrod bertie did not feature electronic screen they both had game running on computer software-based tic-tac-toe game oxo draughts program by christopher strachey were programmed year later were first computer games display visuals on electronic screen rather than through light bulbs references anderson robert circa
