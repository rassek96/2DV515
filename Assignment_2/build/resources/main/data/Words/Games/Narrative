that some authors encode their texts with distinctive literary qualities that distinguish them from other forms discourse nevertheless there clear trend address literary narrative forms separable from other forms this first seen russian formalism through victor shklovsky's analysis relationship between composition style work vladimir propp who analysed plots used traditional folk-tales identified distinct functional components this trend these trends continued work prague school french scholars such claude lévi-strauss roland barthes leads structural analysis narrative increasingly influential body modern work that raises important epistemological questions what text what its role culture how manifested art cinema theater literature why narrative divided into different genres such poetry short stories novels literary theory literary theoretic approach narrative being narrowly defined fiction-writing mode which narrator communicating directly reader until late 19th century literary criticism academic exercise dealt solely with poetry including epic poems like iliad paradise lost poetic drama like shakespeare most poems did not have narrator distinct from author but novels lending number voices several characters addition narrator's created possibility narrator's views differing significantly from author's views with rise novel 18th century concept narrator opposed author made question narrator prominent one for literary theory has been proposed that perspective interpretive knowledge are essential characteristics while focalization structure are lateral characteristics narrator types narrators their modes writer's choice narrator crucial for way work fiction perceived by reader there distinction between first-person third-person narrative which gérard genette refers intradiegetic extradiegetic narrative respectively intradiagetic narrators are two types homodiegetic narrator participates character story such narrator cannot know more about other characters than what their actions reveal heterodiegetic narrator contrast describes experiences characters that appear story which he she does not participate most narrators present their story from one following perspectives called narrative modes first-person third-person limited omniscient generally first-person narrator brings greater focus on feelings opinions perceptions particular character story on how character views world views other characters if writer's intention get inside world character then good choice although third-person limited narrator alternative that does not require writer reveal all that first-person character would know by contrast third-person omniscient narrator gives panoramic view world story looking into many characters into broader background story third-person omniscient narrator can be animal object can be more abstract instance that does not refer itself for stories which context views many characters are important third-person narrator better choice however third-person narrator does not need be omnipresent guide but instead may merely be protagonist referring himself third person also known third person limited narrator multiple narrators main article multiperspectivity writer may choose let several narrators tell story from different points view then up reader decide which narrator seems most reliable for each part story may refer style writer which he/she expresses paragraph written see for instance works louise erdrich william faulkner's i lay dying prime example use multiple narrators faulkner employs stream consciousness narrate story from various perspectives indigenous american communities narratives storytelling are often told by number elders community this way stories are never static because they are shaped by relationship between narrator audience thus each individual story may have countless variations narrators often incorporate minor changes story order tailor story different audiences aesthetics approach narrative highly aesthetic art thoughtfully composed stories have number aesthetic elements such elements include idea narrative structure with identifiable beginnings middles ends exposition-development-climax-denouement with coherent plot lines strong focus on temporality including retention past attention present action protention/future anticipation substantial focus on

inexorably get worse with no redeeming virtues this typical diseases like alzheimer's disease patient gets worse worse there no hope returning normal life third major type quest narrative positions

psychological transformation this typical triumphant view cancer survivorship breast cancer culture personality traits more specifically big five personality traits appear be associated with type language patterns word use found individual's self-narrative other words language use self-narratives accurately reflects human personality linguistic correlates each big five trait are follows extraversion - positively correlated with words referring humans social processes family agreeableness - positively correlated with family inclusiveness certainty negatively correlated with anger body ie few negative comments about health/body conscientiousness - positively correlated with achievement work negatively related body death anger exclusiveness neuroticism - positively correlated with sadness negative emotion body anger home anxiety negatively correlated with work openness - positively correlated with perceptual processes hearing exclusiveness social sciences approaches human beings often claim understand events when they manage formulate coherent story narrative explaining how they believe event was generated narratives thus lie at foundations our cognitive procedures also provide explanatory framework for social sciences particularly when difficult assemble enough cases permit statistical analysis narrative often used case study research social sciences here has been found that dense contextual interpenetrating nature social forces uncovered by detailed narratives often more interesting useful for both social theory social policy than other forms social inquiry sociologists jaber f gubrium james holstein have contributed formation constructionist approach narrative sociology from their book self we live by narrative identity postmodern world more recent texts such analyzing narrative reality 2009and varieties narrative analysis they have developed analytic framework for researching stories storytelling that centered on interplay institutional discourses big stories on one hand everyday accounts little stories on other goal sociological understanding formal lived texts experience featuring production practices communication accounts inquiry approach order avoid hardened stories narratives that become context-free portable ready be used anywhere anytime for illustrative purposes are being used conceptual metaphors defined by linguist george lakoff approach called narrative inquiry was proposed resting on epistemological assumption that human beings make sense random complex multicausal experience by imposition story structures human propensity simplify data through predilection for narratives over complex data sets typically leads narrative fallacy easier for human mind remember make decisions on basis stories with meaning than remember strings data this one reason why narratives are so powerful why many classics humanities social sciences are written narrative format but humans read meaning into data compose stories even where this unwarranted narrative inquiry way avoid narrative fallacy no different from way avoid other error scholarly research ie by applying usual methodical checks for validity reliability how data are collected analyzed presented several criteria for assessing validity narrative research was proposed including objective aspect emotional aspect social/moral aspect clarity story mathematical sociology approach mathematical sociology theory comparative narratives was devised order describe compare structures expressed directed graph where multiple causal links incident into node are conjoined action-driven sequential events narratives so conceived comprise following ingredients finite set state descriptions world s components which are weakly ordered time finite set actors/agents individual collective p finite set actions mapping p onto structure directed graph generated by letting nodes stand for states directed edges represent how states are changed by specified actions action skeleton can then be abstracted comprising further digraph where actions are depicted nodes edges take form action co-determined context other actions action b narratives can be both abstracted generalised by imposing algebra upon their structures thence defining homomorphism between algebras insertion action-driven causal links narrative can be achieved using method bayesian narratives bayesian narratives developed by peter abell theory comparative narratives conceives narrative directed graph comprising multiple causal links social interactions general form action causes action b specified context absence sufficient comparative cases enable statistical treatment causal links items evidence support against particular causal link are assembled used compute bayesian likelihood ratio link subjective causal statements form i/she did b because subjective counterfactuals if had not been for i/she would not have done b are notable items evidence music linearity one several narrative qualities that can be found musical composition noted by american musicologist edward cone narrative terms are also present analytical language about music different components fugue — subject answer exposition discussion summary — can be cited example however there are several views on concept narrative music role plays one theory that theodore adorno who has suggested that ‘music recites itself its own context narrates without narrative’ another that carolyn abbate who has suggested that ‘certain gestures experienced music constitute narrating voice’ still others have argued that narrative semiotic enterprise that can enrich musical analysis french musicologist jean-jacques nattiez contends that ‘the narrative strictly speaking not music but plot imagined constructed by listeners’ he argues that discussing music terms narrativity simply metaphorical that ‘imagined plot’ may be influenced by work's title other programmatic information provided by composer however abbate has revealed numerous examples musical devices that function narrative voices by limiting music’s ability narrate rare ‘moments that can be identified by their bizarre disruptive effect’ various theorists share this view narrative appearing disruptive rather than normative moments music final word yet be said regarding narratives music there still much be determined cultural storytelling narrative can take on shape story which gives listeners entertaining collaborative avenue for acquiring knowledge many cultures use storytelling way record histories myths values these stories can be seen living entities narrative among cultural communities they carry shared experience history culture within them stories are often used within indigenous cultures order share knowledge younger generation due indigenous narratives leaving room for open-ended interpretation native stories often engage children storytelling process so that they can make their own meaning explanations within story this promotes holistic thinking among native children which works towards merging individual world identity such identity upholds native epistemology gives children sense belonging their cultural identity develops through sharing passing on stories for example number indigenous stories are used illustrate value lesson western apache tribe stories can be used warn misfortune that befalls people when they do not follow acceptable behavior one story speaks offense mother's meddling her married son's life story western apache tribe under attack from neighboring tribe pimas apache mother hears scream thinking her son's wife screaming she tries intervene by yelling at him this alerts pima tribe her location she promptly killed due intervening her son's life indigenous american cultures use storytelling teach children values lessons life although storytelling provides entertainment its primary purpose educate alaskan indigenous natives state that narratives teach children where they fit what their society expects them how create peaceful living environment be responsible worthy members their communities mexican culture many adult figures tell their children stories order teach children values such individuality obedience honesty trust compassion for example one versions la llorona used teach children make safe decisions at night maintain morals community narratives are considered by canadian métis community help children understand that world around them interconnected their lives communities for example métis community share “humorous horse story” children which portrays that horses stumble throughout life just like humans do navajo stories also use dead animals metaphors by showing that all things have purpose lastly elders from alaskan native communities claim that use animals metaphors allow children form their own perspectives while at same time self-reflecting on their own lives american indian elders also state that storytelling invites listeners especially children draw their own conclusions perspectives while self-reflecting upon their lives furthermore they insist that narratives help children grasp obtain wide range perspectives that help them interpret their lives context story american indian community members emphasize children that method obtaining knowledge can be found stories passed down through each generation moreover community members also let children interpret build different perspective each story historiography historiography according lawrence stone narrative has traditionally been main rhetorical device used by historians at time when new social history was demanding social-science model analysis stone detected move back toward narrative stone defined narrative organized chronologically focused on single coherent story descriptive rather than analytical concerned with people not abstract circumstances dealing with particular specific rather than collective statistical he reported that more more 'new historians' are now trying discover what was going on inside people's heads past what was like live past questions which inevitably lead back use narrative some philosophers identify narratives with type explanation mark bevir argues for example that narratives explain actions by appealing beliefs desires actors by locating webs beliefs context historical traditions narrative alternative form explanation that associated with natural science historians committed social science approach however have criticized narrowness narrative its preference for anecdote over analysis clever examples rather than statistical regularities storytelling rights storytelling rights most notably important genre personal experience narrative english academics academic disciplines such english performance folklore literature anthropology cultural studies other social sciences are interested exploring storytelling rights because storytelling rights hinges on ethics storytelling rights retelling other people’s stories explored by asking few questions like whose story what story being used for what does story promise empathy redemption meaning at whose benefit ethics storytelling rights— includes empathy representation— helps people organizations media government agencies clearly understand stories one way which personal experience narratives achieve status authenticity with representation violating representation storytelling rights creates negative repercussions on not only individuals who are engaging storytelling process but also damages social order like communities institutions networks that people are involved because “voice” used powerful tool for agency advocacy this misrepresentation voice often leads misunderstanding exploitation storytelling rights example would be stories abused women because women are told by government agencies that by telling their stories they will be heard helped but truth irony that domestic violence has become ‘big business' because law system does not listen voices these battered women this example illustrates how women reshape their stories gain assistance from shelter charities but women reshaping their stories violates ethics storytelling rights because this fuels “big business” domestic violence there was another study on hurricane katrina survivors where media misrepresented voices survivors manipulated public negative way media press turned whole country against community that desperately needed help because journalist reshaped stories survivors television broadcasts newspaper articles nevertheless this study contradicted media used voice” prove that media misrepresented their stories survivors at end article readers learned that media was actually misrepresenting community new orleans because truth was heard “voice” survivors which people’s stories revealed that community was actually helping each other out during destructive time empathy important aspect storytelling rights because if audience has empathy towards story there will be less chance for violating ethics empathy presumes ability understand another’s life story its opposite inability empathize reserved for situations that normal person cannot imagine including notably unspeakable evils insanity empathy describes sphere normal allows us imagine what any normal person would do other words listener narrative will not be able comprehend story without empathy that why empathy important component concerning storytelling rights examples domestic violence against women survivors hurricane katrina show how stories are reshaped either by narrators themselves by others highlights important issue regarding ethics storytelling rights narration such that listener audience infringes on storytelling rights because sometimes they are not listening “voice” teller ultimately when narrator reshapes their own story “voice” becomes lost muddled ears audience logically when narrator’s voice not being adequately represented ethics storytelling rights are not honored other specific applications narrative environment contested term that has been used for techniques architectural exhibition design which 'stories are told space' also for virtual environments which computer games are played which are invented by computer game authors narrative film usually uses images sounds on film more recently on analogue digital video media convey story narrative film usually thought terms fiction but may also assemble stories from filmed reality some documentary film but narrative film may also use animation narrative history genre factual historical writing that uses chronology its framework opposed thematic treatment historical subject narrative poetry poetry
