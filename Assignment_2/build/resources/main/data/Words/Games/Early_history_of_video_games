list video games development list years video games timeline arcade video game history v t e history video games spans period time between invention first electronic games today covering long period invention changes video gaming would not reach mainstream popularity until 1970s 1980s when arcade video games gaming consoles home computer games were introduced general public since then video gaming has become popular form entertainment part modern culture most parts world early history video games therefore covers period time between first interactive electronic game with electronic display first true video games early 1950s rise early arcade video games 1970s pong beginning first generation video game consoles with magnavox odyssey both during this time there were wide range devices inventions corresponding with large advances computing technology actual first video game dependent on definition video game used following invention cathode-ray tube amusement device earliest known interactive electronic game well first use electronic display first true video games were created early 1950s initially created technology demonstrations such bertie brain nimrod computers video games also became purview academic research series games generally simulating real-world board games were created at various research institutions explore programming human–computer interaction computer algorithms these include oxo christopher strachey's draughts program first software-based games incorporate crt display several chess checkers programs possibly first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's tennis for two featuring moving graphics on oscilloscope computing technology improved over time computers became smaller faster ability work on them was opened up university employees undergraduate students by end 1950s these new programmers began create games for non-academic purposes leading up release spacewar one earliest known digital computer games be available outside single research institute throughout rest 1960s digital computer games were created by increasingly numerous programmers sometimes sold commercially catalogs audience for video games expanded more than few dozen research institutions with falling cost computers programming languages that would run on multiple types computers were created wider variety games began be developed video games transitioned into new era early 1970s with launch commercial video game industry with display coin-operated arcade game galaxy game release first widely available arcade game computer space then with release immensely successful arcade game pong first home video game console magnavox odyssey which launched first generation video game consoles contents defining video game initial games interactive visual games spread games new industry references sources external links defining video game circuitry schematic from patent for cathode-ray tube amusement device term video game has evolved over decades from purely technical definition general concept defining new class interactive entertainment technically for product be video game there must be video signal transmitted cathode ray tube crt that creates rasterized image on screen this definition would preclude early computer games that outputted results printer teletype rather than display any game rendered on vector-scan monitor any game played on modern high definition display most handheld game systems from technical standpoint these would more properly be called electronic games computer games today however term video game has completely shed its purely technical definition encompasses wider range technology while still rather ill-defined term video game now generally encompasses any game played on hardware built with electronic logic circuits that incorporates element interactivity outputs results player's actions display going by this broader definition first video games appeared early 1950s they were tied largely research projects at universities large corporations though had little influence on each other due their primary purpose academic promotional devices rather than entertainment games ancestors these games include cathode-ray tube amusement device earliest known interactive electronic game well first incorporate cathode ray tube screen player simulates artillery shell trajectory on crt screen connected oscilloscope with set knobs switches device uses purely analog electronics does not use any digital computer memory device execute program was patented by thomas t goldsmith jr estle ray mann while idea behind game was potentially use television set display thus sell invention consumers goldsmith mann worked at television designer dumont laboratories patent first for electronic game was never used device never manufactured beyond original handmade prototypes this along with lack electronic logic circuits keeps device from being considered first video game around same time device was invented earliest known written computer game was developed by alan turing david champernowne chess simulation called turochamp though was never actually implemented on computer code was too complicated run on machines time turing tested code game where he mimicked operation code real chess game against opponent but was never able run program on computer initial games drawing nimrod computer first publicly demonstrated electronic game was created bertie brain was arcade game tic-tac-toe built by josef kates for canadian national exhibition showcase his new miniature vacuum tube additron tube he designed specialized computer use which he built with assistance engineers from rogers majestic large metal computer which was four meters tall could only play tic-tac-toe on lightbulb-backed display was installed engineering building at canadian national exhibition from august 25–september game was success at two-week exhibition with attendees lining up play kates adjusted difficulty up down for players after exhibition bertie was dismantled largely forgotten novelty kates has said that he was working on so many projects at same time that he had no energy spare for preserving despite its significance nearly year later on may nimrod computer—created by engineering firm nascent computer developer ferranti—was presented at festival britain then showcased for three weeks october at berlin industrial show before being dismantled using panel lights for its display was designed exclusively play game nim moves were made by players pressing buttons which corresponded with lights nimrod could play either traditional reverse form game machine was twelve feet wide nine feet deep five feet tall was based on earlier nim-playing machine nimatron designed by edward condon built by westinghouse electric for display at new york world's fair nimatron had been constructed from electromechanical relays weighed over ton nimrod was primarily intended showcase ferranti's computer design programming skills rather than entertain was not followed up by any future games despite this most onlookers at festival britain were more interested playing game than programming engineering logic behind christopher strachey's draughts program on ferranti mark around this time non-visual games were being developed at various research computer laboratories for example christopher strachey developed simulation game draughts checkers for pilot ace that he unsuccessfully attempted run for first time july at british national physical laboratory completed this first known computer game be created for general-purpose computer rather than machine specifically made for game like bertie strachey's program inspired arthur samuel develop his own checkers game for ibm successive iterations developed rudimentary artificial intelligence by version was shown on television also dietrich prinz wrote first limited program chess for university manchester's general-purpose ferranti mark computer one first commercially available computers program was only capable computing mate-in-two problems was not powerful enough play full game had no video output around same time early 1950s rand corporation developed series combat simulation games increasing complexity where player would enter orders intercept enemy aircraft set up their forces counter enemy army invasion these simulations were not yet true video games they required human intervention interpret player's orders final results computer only controlled paths that enemies would take interactive visual games electronic delay storage automatic calculator which ran oxo alexander s douglas created oxo software program for electronic delay storage automatic calculator edsac computer which simulates game tic-tac-toe edsac was one first stored-program computers with memory that could be read from written filled entire room included three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes graphically display state computer's memory part thesis on human–computer interaction douglas used one these screens portray other information user he chose do so via displaying current state game player entered input using rotary telephone controller selecting which nine squares on board they wished move next their move would appear on screen then computer's move would follow game was not available general public was only available be played university cambridge's mathematical laboratory by special permission edsac could not be moved like other early video games after serving douglas's purpose game was discarded around same time strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer manchester mark culminating version for ferranti mark which had crt display like oxo display was mostly static updating only when move was made oxo strachey's draughts program are earliest known games display visuals on electronic screen first known game incorporating graphics that updated real time rather than only when player made move was pool game programmed by william brown ted lewis specifically for demonstration university michigan-developed midsac computer at university michigan game developed over six months by pair featured pool stick controlled by joystick knob full rack balls on table seen overhead view computer calculated movements balls they collided moved around table disappearing when they reached pocket updated graphics continuously forty times second so show real-time motion like previous video games pool game was intended primarily showcase computing power midsac computer set-up for tennis for two exhibited while further games like checkers chess were developed on research computers next milestone video games came with tennis for two perhaps first game created solely for entertainment rather than technology demonstration research tool program simulated game tennis created by american physicist william higinbotham for visitors at brookhaven national laboratory be more entertaining for visitors on their public day than usual static exhibits about nuclear power game ran on donner model analog computer displayed side view tennis court on oscilloscope players controlled angle their shots with attached controllers game calculated simulated trajectory ball including possibility hitting net game was first shown on october hundreds visitors lined up play new game during its debut due game's popularity upgraded version was shown following year with enhancements including larger screen different levels simulated gravity afterwards having served its purpose game was dismantled for its component parts while game had no innovations game design technological development its status entertainment-focused game rather than academic project technological showpiece has led be considered one first real video games they are generally thought today over next few years during 1957–61 various computer games continued be created context academic computer programming research particularly computer technology improved include smaller transistor-based computers on which programs could be created run real time rather than operations run batches few programs however while used showcase power computer they ran on were also intended entertainment products these were generally created by undergraduate students such at massachusetts institute technology where they were allowed on occasion develop programs for tx-0 experimental computer these interactive graphical games were created by community programmers many them students affiliated with tech model railroad club tmrc led by alan kotok peter samson bob saunders games included tic-tac-toe which used light pen play simple game noughts crosses against computer mouse maze mouse maze allowed users use light pen set up maze walls on monitor spots that represented bits cheese glasses martini virtual mouse was then released would traverse maze find objects additionally wargame simulations from early 1950s by rand corporation had expanded into more complicated simulations which required little human intervention had also sparked creation business management simulation games such management game which was used business schools such at carnegie mellon university by by there were over different business simulation games use with various graphical capabilities decade ended despite several video games having been developed there was no such thing commercial video game industry almost all games had been developed on single machine for specific purposes few simulation games were neither commercial nor for entertainment spread games see also early mainframe games spacewar running on computer history museum's pdp-1 by mit had acquired dec pdp-1 minicomputer successor tx-0 which also used vector display system system's comparatively small size processing speed meant that like with tx-0 university allowed its undergraduate students employees write programs for computer which were not directly academically related whenever was not use 1961-62 harvard mit employees martin graetz steve russell wayne wiitanen created game spacewar on pdp-1 inspired by science fiction books such lensman series game was copied several early minicomputer installations american academic institutions making potentially first video game be available outside single research institute two-player game has players engaged dogfight between two spaceships set against backdrop randomly generated background starfield game was developed meet three precepts use much computer's resources possible be consistently interesting therefore have every run be different be entertaining therefore game game was multiplayer game because computer had no resources left over handle controlling other ship after game's initial development members tmrc worked improve game adding accurate starfield gravitational body spread couple dozen other institutions with pdp-1 process which continued over next few years computer was uncomfortable use for extended periods time kotok saunders created detached control device essentially early gamepad spacewar was reportedly used smoke test by dec technicians on new pdp-1 systems before shipping since was only available program that exercised every aspect hardware although game was widespread for era was still very limited its direct reach pdp-1 was priced at us$120000 only were ever sold many without monitor which prohibited spacewar any game time from reaching beyond narrow academic audience russell has been quoted saying that aspect game that he was most pleased with was number other programmers inspired write their own games development space travel part led development unix operating system although market for commercial games—and software general—was small due cost computers limiting their spread research institutions large corporations several were still created by programmers distributed by computer manufacturers number games could be found april ibm program catalog these included board games bbc vik baseball demonstrator three dimensional tic-tack-toe following spread spacewar further computer games developed by programmers at universities were also developed distributed over next few years these included socratic system question answer game designed teach medical students how diagnose patients by wallace feurzeig dice game by edward steinberger creation general programming languages like basic which could be run on different hardware types allowed for programs be written for more than one specific computer turn letting games written them spread more end players programming community than before these games included baseball simulation game written basic by john kemeny basic bingo game by larry bethurum basketball simulation game written basic by charles r bacheller may another baseball game that simulates world series written basic by jacob bergmann august space travel written by ken thompson for multics system which led part development unix operating system hamurabi text-based focal game written by doug dyment converted basic by david h ahl one first strategy video games ever made hamurabi space travel were among several early mainframe games that were written during time spread beyond their initial mainframe computers general-purpose languages like basic new industry see also history video games § new industry arcade game first generation video game consoles galaxy game was one first arcade video games at beginning 1970s video games existed almost entirely novelties passed around by programmers technicians with access computers primarily at research institutions large companies history video games transitioned into new era early decade however with rise commercial video game industry bill pitts hugh tuck developed coin-operated computer game galaxy game at stanford university using dec pdp-11 computer with vector displays pair was inspired make game by spacewar tuck had remarked while playing game that coin-operated version game would be very successful such device was unfeasible due cost computers but dec released pdp-11 for us$20000 while this was still too high for commercially viable product most games arcades cost around us$1000 at time pair felt was low enough build prototype determine interest optimal per-game pricing only prototype units were ever built though second prototype was adapted run up eight games at once after its initial installation at stanford september pair met with nolan bushnell who informed them his own game he was making for much lower price that game was computer space developed by bushnell ted dabney they had found data general nova us$4000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough run four games spacewar at once computer turned out not actually be powerful enough for project while investigating concept replacing some computer with purpose-built hardware however pair discovered that making system explicitly for running such game rather than general programs would be much less expensive low $100 by when bushnell met with pitts tuck prototype version had been successfully displayed for short time august local bar design was nearly finished pair had founded company around called syzygy bushnell had also found manufacturer for game nutting associates who would make final game cabinets sell them distributors bushnell felt that galaxy game was not real competitor computer space due its high price pitts tuck believed however that despite economic argument their game was superior they felt that galaxy game was true expansion spacewar while computer space just pale imitation some players at time however believed galaxy game actually be just version spacewar galaxy game's prototype installation was very popular though at low price-per-game pair developed second version display at same location they were never able enter production though they eventually had abandon idea after spending us$65000 developing due high cost lack business plan pong helped usher new chapter video game history two months after galaxy game's installation computer space was released was first coin-operated video game be commercially sold first widely available video game any kind while did well its initial locations near college campuses performed very poorly bars arcades where pinball other arcade games were typically placed while was commercially successful made over us$1000000 did not meet high expectations nutting who had expected sell more than units bushnell dabney immediately started work on another game using same television set design computer space well founding their own company atari inc back their projects while initially this game was be driving game that bushnell planned design their first employee allan alcorn took prototype ping-pong game suggestion bushnell's expanded on create game company immediately seized on they were unable find manufacturer but on evidence success their prototype installation decided produce game cabinets themselves pong was released year after computer space was immensely commercially successful selling over units inspired copycat games be sold america europe japan led popularization medium that same year saw release magnavox odyssey first home video game console which could be connected television set inventor ralph h baer had initially had idea make interactive game on television set unable do so with technological constraints at time he began work on device that would attach television set display games brown box last prototype seven was licensed magnavox adapt produce they announced console may went on sale that september console its games featured numerous innovations beyond being first video game device for home consumers was first game use raster-scan video display television set directly displayed via modification video signal was also first video gaming device be displayed television commercial sold for us$100 shipped with several games including table tennis which bushnell had seen demo which pong had been based on odyssey sold over units more than by end buoyed by popularity table tennis game turn driven by success pong pong odyssey kicked off new era video gaming with numerous other competitors starting up video game industry grew popularity
