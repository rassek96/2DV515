acquired june by compaq which subsequently merged with hewlett-packard hp may some parts dec notably compiler business hudson massachusetts facility were sold intel initially focusing on small end computer market allowed dec grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts compete with them their pdp series machines became popular 1960s especially pdp-8 widely considered be first successful minicomputer looking simplify update their line dec replaced most their smaller machines with pdp-11 eventually selling over units cementing dec's position industry originally designed follow-on pdp-11 dec's vax-11 series was first widely used 32-bit minicomputer sometimes referred superminis these systems were able compete many roles with larger mainframe computers such ibm system/370 vax was best-seller with over sold its sales through 1980s propelled company into second largest computer company industry at its peak dec was second largest employer massachusetts second

space rapidly changing market was dec alpha 64-bit risc processor architecture dec initially started work on alpha way re-implement their vax series but also employed range high-performance workstations although alpha processor family met both these goals for most its lifetime was fastest processor family on market extremely high asking prices were outsold by lower priced x86 chips from intel clones such amd dec was acquired june by compaq what was at that time largest merger history computer industry at time compaq was focused on enterprise market had recently purchased several

invented clustering operating system technology that treated multiple machines one logical entity clustering permitted sharing pooled disk tape storage via hsc50/70/90 later series hierarchical

dec was primary sponsor for this project which was contemporary gnu project but not associated with period 1994–99 linus torvalds developed versions linux on early alphaserver systems made available him by engineering department compaq software engineers developed special linux kernel modules well-known linux distribution that ran on alphaserver systems was red hat another distribution that ran on alpha was gentoo linux microsoft was not exclusively bound alpha chip so pursued other processor makers such ibm with powerpc architecture eventually capitalized on emerging strength intel
