artistic fancy than facts conventional scientific theory definition can also vary depending on viewpoint observer many science fiction films include elements mysticism occult magic supernatural considered by some be more properly elements fantasy occult religious film this transforms movie genre into science fantasy with religious quasi-religious philosophy serving driving motivation movie

civilization called krell does not ensure loss primitive dangerous urges film this part primitive mind manifests itself monstrous destructive force emanating from freudian subconscious id some films blur line between genres such films where protagonist gains extraordinary powers superhero these films usually employ quasi-plausible reason for hero gaining these powers not all science fiction

scientific knowledge such liberties can be most readily observed films that show spacecraft maneuvering outer space vacuum should preclude transmission sound maneuvers employing wings yet sound track filled with inappropriate flying noises changes flight path resembling aircraft banking filmmakers unfamiliar with specifics space travel focus instead on providing acoustical atmosphere more familiar maneuvers aircraft similar instances ignoring science favor art can be seen when movies present environmental effects portrayed star wars star trek entire planets are destroyed titanic explosions requiring mere seconds whereas actual event this nature takes many hours role scientist has varied considerably science fiction film genre depending on public perception science advanced technology starting with dr frankenstein mad scientist became stock character who posed dire threat society perhaps even civilization certain portrayals mad scientist such peter sellers's performance dr strangelove have become iconic genre monster films 1950s scientist often played heroic role only person who could provide technological fix for some impending doom reflecting distrust government that began 1960s united states brilliant but rebellious scientist became common theme often serving cassandra-like role during impending disaster biotechnology eg cloning popular scientific element films

on physics concepts such special relativity phenomenon time dilation which could occur if spaceship was travelling near speed light wormholes some films show time travel not being attained from advanced technology but rather from inner source personal power such 2000s-era films donnie darko mr nobody butterfly effect more conventional time travel movies use technology bring past life present present that lies our future film iceman told story reanimation frozen neanderthal film freejack shows time travel used pull victims horrible deaths forward time split-second before their demise then use their bodies for spare parts common theme time travel film paradoxical nature travelling through time french new wave film la jetée director chris marker depicts self-fulfilling aspect person

genre commentary on social issues science fiction film genre has long served useful means discussing sensitive topical issues without arousing controversy often provides thoughtful social commentary on potential unforeseen future issues fictional setting allows for deeper examination reflection ideas presented with perspective viewer watching remote events most controversial issues science fiction films tend fall into two general storylines utopian dystopian either society will become better worse future because controversy most science fiction films will fall into dystopian film category rather than utopian category types commentary controversy presented science fiction films often illustrate particular concerns periods which they were produced early science fiction films expressed fears about automation replacing workers dehumanization society through science technology for example man white suit used science fiction concept means satirize postwar british establishment conservatism industrial capitalists trade unions another example hal from space odyssey he controls shuttle later harms its crew kubrick's vision reveals technology competitive force that must be defeated order for humans evolve later films explored fears environmental catastrophe technology-created disasters overpopulation how they would impact society individuals eg soylent green elysium monster movies 1950s—like godzilla 1954—served stand-ins for fears nuclear war communism views on cold war 1970s science fiction films also became effective way satirizing contemporary social mores with silent running dark star presenting hippies space riposte militaristic types that had dominated earlier films stanley kubrick's clockwork orange presented horrific vision youth culture portraying youth gang engaged rape murder along with disturbing scenes forced psychological conditioning serving comment on societal responses crime logan's run depicted futuristic swingers' utopia that practiced euthanasia form population control stepford wives anticipated reaction women's liberation movement enemy mine demonstrated that foes we have come hate are often just like us even if they appear alien contemporary science fiction films continue explore social political issues one recent example minority report debuting months after terrorist attacks september focused on issues police powers privacy civil liberties near-future united states some like island never let me go explore issues surrounding cloning more recently headlines surrounding events such iraq war international terrorism avian influenza scare united states anti-immigration laws have found their way into consciousness contemporary filmmakers film v for vendetta drew inspiration from controversial issues such patriot act war on terror while science fiction thrillers such children men also district commented on diverse social issues such xenophobia propaganda cognitive dissonance

evolved expanded has fused with other film genres such gothic thrillers film noir when science fiction integrates film noir elements bin aziz calls resulting hybrid form future noir form which encapsulates postmodern encounter with generic persistence creating mixture irony pessimism prediction extrapolation bleakness nostalgia future noir films such brazil blade runner monkeys dark city children men use protagonist who increasingly dubious alienated fragmented at once dark playful like characters gibson's neuromancer yet still with shadow philip marlowe future noir films that are set post-apocalyptic world restructure re-represent society parody atmospheric world usually found noir’s construction city—dark bleak beguiled future noir films often intermingle elements gothic thriller genre such minority report which makes references occult practices alien with its tagline space no one can hear you scream space vessel nostromo that hark back images haunted house gothic horror tradition bin aziz states that films such james cameron ’s terminator are subgenre techno noir that create atmospheric feast noir darkness double-edged world that not what seems film versus literature when compared science fiction literature science fiction films often rely less on human imagination more upon action scenes special effect-created alien creatures exotic backgrounds since 1970s film audiences have come expect high standard for special effects science fiction films some cases science fiction-themed films superimpose exotic futuristic setting onto what would not otherwise be science-fiction tale nevertheless some critically acclaimed science fiction movies have followed path science fiction literature using story development explore abstract concepts influence science fiction authors jules verne was first major science fiction author be adapted for screen with melies le voyage dans la lune lieues sous les mers which used verne's scenarios framework for fantastic
