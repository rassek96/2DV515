conducted with g m minchin j c m stanton they had attempted generate electrical signal by projecting image onto selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by cathode ray beam these experiments were conducted before march when minchin died but they were later repeated by two different teams by h miller j w strange from emi by h iams rose from rca both teams succeeded transmitting very faint images with original campbell-swinton's selenium-coated plate although others had experimented with using cathode ray tube receiver concept using one transmitter was novel first cathode ray tube use hot cathode was developed by john b johnson who gave his name term johnson noise harry weiner weinhart western electric became commercial product hungarian engineer kálmán tihanyi designed television system utilizing fully electronic scanning display elements employing principle charge storage within scanning camera tube problem low sensitivity light resulting low electrical output from transmitting camera tubes would be solved with introduction charge-storage technology by kálmán tihanyi beginning his solution was camera tube that accumulated stored electrical charges photoelectrons within tube throughout each scanning cycle device was first described patent application he filed hungary march for television system he dubbed radioskop after further refinements included patent application tihanyi's patent was declared void great britain so he applied for patents united states although his breakthrough would be incorporated into design rca's iconoscope us patent for tihanyi's transmitting tube would not be granted until may patent for his receiving tube had been granted previous october both patents had been purchased by rca prior their approval charge storage remains basic principle design imaging devices for television present day on december at hamamatsu industrial high school japan japanese inventor kenjiro takayanagi demonstrated tv system with 40-line resolution that employed crt display this was first working example fully electronic television receiver takayanagi did not apply for patent on september american inventor philo farnsworth's image dissector camera tube transmitted its first image simple straight line at his laboratory at green street san francisco by september farnsworth had developed system sufficiently hold demonstration for press this widely regarded first electronic television demonstration system was improved further by elimination motor generator so that his television system now had no mechanical parts that year farnsworth transmitted first live human images with his system including three half-inch image his wife elma pem with her eyes closed possibly due bright lighting required vladimir zworykin demonstrates electronic television meanwhile vladimir zworykin was also experimenting with cathode ray tube create show images while working for westinghouse electric he began develop electronic camera tube but demonstration image was dim had low contrast poor definition was stationary zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond laboratory stage but rca which acquired westinghouse patent asserted that patent for farnsworth's image dissector was written so broadly that would exclude any other electronic imaging device thus rca on basis zworykin's patent application filed patent interference suit against farnsworth us patent office examiner disagreed decision finding priority invention for farnsworth against zworykin farnsworth claimed that zworykin's system would be unable produce electrical image type challenge his patent zworykin received patent for color transmission version his patent application he also divided his original application zworykin was unable unwilling introduce evidence working model his tube that was based on his patent application september after losing appeal courts determined go forward with commercial manufacturing television equipment rca agreed pay farnsworth us$1 million over ten-year period addition license payments use his patents rca introduced improved camera tube that relied on tihanyi's charge storage principle dubbed iconoscope by zworykin new tube had light sensitivity about lux thus was claimed be much more sensitive than farnsworth's image dissector however farnsworth had overcome his power problems with his image dissector through invention completely unique multipactor device that he began work on demonstrated this small tube could amplify signal reportedly 60th power better showed great promise all fields electronics unfortunately problem with multipactor was that wore out at unsatisfactory rate at berlin radio show august manfred von ardenne gave public demonstration television system using crt for both transmission reception however ardenne had not developed camera tube using crt instead flying-spot scanner scan slides film philo farnsworth gave world's first public demonstration all-electronic television system using live camera at franklin institute philadelphia on august for ten days afterwards mexican inventor guillermo gonzález camarena also played important role early tv his experiments with tv known telectroescopía at first began led patent for trichromatic field sequential system color television britain emi engineering team led by isaac shoenberg applied for patent for new device they dubbed emitron which formed heart cameras they designed for bbc on november 405-line broadcasting service employing emitron began at studios alexandra palace transmitted from specially built mast atop one victorian building's towers alternated for short time with baird's mechanical system adjoining studios but was more reliable visibly superior this was world's first regular high-definition television service original american iconoscope was noisy had high ratio interference signal ultimately gave disappointing results especially when compared high definition mechanical scanning systems then becoming available emi team under supervision isaac shoenberg analyzed how iconoscope emitron produces electronic signal concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% theoretical maximum they solved this problem by developing patenting two new camera tubes dubbed super-emitron cps emitron super-emitron was between ten fifteen times more sensitive than original emitron iconoscope tubes some cases this ratio was considerably greater was used for outside broadcasting by bbc for first time on armistice day when general public could watch on television set king laid wreath at cenotaph this was first time that anyone had broadcast live street scene from cameras installed on roof neighboring buildings because neither farnsworth nor rca would do same

implemented european ccir standard kálmán tihanyi described principle plasma display first flat panel display system color main article color television basic idea using three monochrome images produce color image had been experimented with almost soon black-and-white televisions had first been built although he gave no practical details among earliest published proposals for television was one by maurice le blanc for color system including first mentions television literature line frame scanning polish inventor jan szczepanik patented color television system using selenium photoelectric cell at transmitter electromagnet controlling oscillating mirror moving prism at receiver but his system contained no means analyzing spectrum colors at transmitting end could not have worked he described another inventor hovannes adamian also experimented with color television early first color television project claimed by him was patented germany on march patent № then britain on april patent № france patent № russia patent № scottish inventor john logie baird demonstrated world's first color transmission on july using scanning discs at transmitting receiving ends with three spirals apertures each spiral with filters different primary color three light sources at receiving end with commutator alternate their illumination baird also made world's first color broadcast on february sending mechanically scanned 120-line image from baird's crystal palace studios projection screen at london's dominion theatre mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by bell laboratories june using three complete systems photoelectric cells amplifiers glow-tubes color filters with series mirrors superimpose red green blue images into one full color image first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by john logie baird he publicly demonstrated color television combining traditional black-and-white display with rotating colored disk this device was very deep but was later improved with mirror folding light path into entirely practical device resembling large conventional console however baird was not happy with design early had commented british government committee that fully electronic device would be better hungarian engineer peter carl goldmark introduced electro-mechanical system while at cbs which contained iconoscope sensor cbs field-sequential color system was partly mechanical with disc made red blue green filters spinning inside television camera at rpm similar disc spinning synchronization front cathode ray tube inside receiver set system was first demonstrated federal communications commission fcc on august shown press on september cbs began experimental color field tests using film early august live cameras by november nbc owned by rca made its first field test color television on february cbs began daily color field tests on june these color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets no color television sets were available public at this time viewing color field tests was restricted rca cbs engineers invited press war production board halted manufacture television radio equipment for civilian use from april august limiting any opportunity introduce color television general public early baird had started work on fully electronic system he called telechrome early telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side phosphor plate phosphor was patterned so electrons from guns only fell on one side patterning other using cyan magenta phosphors reasonable limited-color image could be obtained he also demonstrated same system using monochrome signals produce image called stereoscopic at time demonstration on august was first example practical color television system work on telechrome continued plans were made introduce three-gun version for full color however baird's untimely death ended development telechrome system similar concepts were common through 1940s 1950s differing primarily way they re-combined colors generated by three guns geer tube was similar baird's concept but used small pyramids with phosphors deposited on their outside faces instead baird's patterning on flat surface penetron used three layers phosphor on top each other increased power beam reach upper layers when drawing those colors chromatron used set focusing wires select colored phosphors arranged vertical stripes on tube one great technical challenges introducing color broadcast television was desire conserve bandwidth potentially three times that existing black-and-white standards not use excessive amount radio spectrum united states after considerable research national television systems committee approved all-electronic compatible color system developed by rca which encoded color information separately from brightness information greatly reduced resolution color information order conserve bandwidth brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution while color televisions could decode extra information signal produce limited-resolution color display higher resolution black-and-white lower resolution color images combine brain produce seemingly high-resolution color image ntsc standard represented major technical achievement color bars used test pattern sometimes used when no program material available although all-electronic color was introduced us high prices scarcity color programming greatly slowed its acceptance marketplace first national color broadcast tournament roses parade occurred on january but during following ten years most network broadcasts nearly all local programming continued be black-and-white was not until mid-1960s that color sets started selling large numbers due part color transition which was announced that over half all network prime-time programming would be broadcast color that fall first all-color prime-time season came just one year later last holdout among daytime network programs converted color resulting first completely all-color network season early color sets were either floor-standing console models tabletop versions nearly bulky heavy so practice they remained firmly anchored one place introduction ge's relatively compact lightweight porta-color set spring made watching color television more flexible convenient proposition sales color sets finally surpassed sales black-and-white sets color broadcasting europe was not standardized on pal format until 1960s broadcasts did not start until by this point many technical problems early sets had been worked out spread color sets europe was fairly rapid by mid-1970s only stations broadcasting black-and-white were few high-numbered uhf stations small markets handful low-power repeater stations even smaller markets such vacation spots by even last these had converted color by early 1980s b&w sets had been pushed into niche markets notably low-power uses small portable sets for use video monitor screens lower-cost consumer equipment by late 1980's even these areas switched color sets digital main article digital television see also digital television transition digital television dtv transmission audio video by digitally processed multiplexed signals contrast totally analog channel separated signals used by analog television digital tv can support more than one program same channel bandwidth innovative service that represents first significant evolution television technology since color television 1950s digital tv's roots have been tied very closely availability inexpensive high performance computers was not until 1990s that digital tv became feasible mid-1980s japanese consumer electronics firms forged ahead with development hdtv technology muse analog format proposed by nhk japanese company was seen pacesetter that threatened eclipse us electronics companies' technologies until june japanese muse standard based on analog system was front-runner among more than different technical concepts under consideration then american company general instrument demonstrated feasibility digital television signal this breakthrough was such significance that fcc was persuaded delay its decision on atv standard until digitally based standard could be developed march when became clear that digital standard was feasible fcc made number critical decisions first commission declared that new atv standard must be more than enhanced analog signal but be able provide genuine hdtv signal with at least twice resolution existing television images7 then ensure that viewers who did not wish buy new digital television set could continue receive conventional television broadcasts dictated that new atv standard must be capable being simulcast on different channels8the new atv standard also allowed new dtv signal be based on entirely new design principles although incompatible with existing ntsc standard new dtv standard would be able incorporate many improvements final standards adopted by fcc did not require single standard for scanning formats aspect ratios lines resolution this compromise resulted from dispute between consumer electronics industry joined by some broadcasters computer industry joined by film industry some public interest groups over which two scanning processes—interlaced progressive—would be best suited for newer digital hdtv compatible display devices interlaced scanning which had been specifically designed for older analogue crt display technologies scans even-numbered lines first then odd-numbered ones fact interlaced scanning can be looked at first video compression model was partly designed 1940s double image resolution exceed limitations television broadcast bandwidth another reason for its adoption was limit flickering on early crt screens whose phosphor coated screens could only retain image from electron scanning gun for relatively short duration however interlaced scanning does not work efficiently on newer display devices such liquid-crystal lcd for example which are better suited more frequent progressive refresh rate progressive scanning format that computer industry had long adopted for computer display monitors scans every line sequence from top bottom progressive scanning effect doubles amount data generated for every full screen displayed comparison interlaced scanning by painting screen one pass 1/60 second instead two passes 1/30 second computer industry argued that progressive scanning superior because does not flicker on new standard display devices manner interlaced scanning also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with internet more cheaply converted interlaced formats than vice versa film industry also supported progressive scanning because offered more efficient means converting filmed programming into digital formats for their part consumer electronics industry broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was only technology that could transmit highest quality pictures then currently feasible ie lines per picture pixels per line broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive interlaced programming not readily compatible with progressive format william f schreiber who was director advanced television research program at massachusetts institute technology from until his retirement thought that continued advocacy interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying get back substantial investments they made interlaced technology digital television transition started late 2000s all governments across world set deadline for analog shutdown by 2010s initially adoption rate was low first digital
