v t e random-access memory ram /ræm/ form computer data storage random-access memory device allows data items be read written almost same amount time irrespective physical location data inside memory contrast with other direct-access data storage media such hard disks cd-rws dvd-rws older drum memory time required read write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on recording medium due mechanical limitations such media rotation speeds arm movement ram contains multiplexing demultiplexing circuitry connect data lines addressed storage for reading writing entry usually more than one bit storage accessed by same address ram devices often have multiple data lines are said be '8-bit' '16-bit' etc devices today's technology random-access memory takes form integrated circuits ram normally associated with volatile types memory such dram memory modules where stored information lost if power removed although many efforts have been made develop non-volatile ram chips other types non-volatile memories exist that allow random access for read operations but either do not allow write operations have other kinds limitations on them these include most types rom type flash memory called nor-flash integrated-circuit ram chips came into market early 1970s with first commercially available dram chip intel introduced october contents history types ram memory

1930s used mechanical counters store information portion core memory with modern flash sd card on top megabit chip – one last models developed by veb carl zeiss jena early computers used relays mechanical counters delay lines for main memory functions ultrasonic delay lines could only reproduce data order was written drum memory could be expanded at relatively low cost but efficient retrieval memory items required knowledge physical layout drum optimize speed latches built out vacuum tube triodes later out discrete transistors were used for smaller faster memories such registers such registers were relatively large too costly use for large amounts data generally only few dozen few hundred bits such memory could be provided first practical form random-access memory was williams tube starting stored data electrically charged spots on face cathode ray tube since electron beam crt could read write spots on tube any order memory was random access capacity williams tube was few hundred around thousand bits but was much smaller faster more power-efficient than using individual vacuum tube latches developed at university manchester england williams tube provided medium on which first electronically stored-memory program was implemented manchester small-scale experimental machine ssem computer which first successfully ran program on june fact rather than williams tube memory being designed for ssem ssem was testbed demonstrate reliability memory magnetic-core memory was invented developed up until mid-1970s became widespread form random-access memory relying on array magnetized rings by changing sense each ring's magnetization data could be stored with one bit stored per ring since every ring had combination address wires select read write access any memory location any sequence was possible magnetic core memory was standard form memory system until displaced by solid-state memory integrated circuits starting early 1970s robert h dennard invented dynamic random-access memory dram this allowed replacement 6-transistor latch circuit by single transistor for each memory bit greatly increasing memory density at cost volatility data was stored tiny capacitance each transistor had be periodically refreshed every few milliseconds before charge could leak away prior development integrated read-only memory rom circuits permanent read-only random-access memory was often constructed using diode matrices driven by address decoders specially wound core rope memory planes types ram two widely used forms modern ram are static ram sram dynamic ram dram sram bit data stored using state six transistor memory cell this form ram more expensive produce but generally faster requires less dynamic power than dram modern computers sram often used cache memory for cpu dram stores bit data using transistor capacitor pair which together comprise dram memory cell capacitor holds high low charge respectively transistor acts switch that lets control circuitry on chip read capacitor's state charge change this form memory less expensive produce than static ram predominant form computer memory used modern computers both static dynamic ram are considered volatile their state lost reset when power removed from system by contrast read-only memory rom stores data by permanently enabling disabling selected transistors such that memory cannot be altered writeable variants rom such eeprom flash memory share properties both rom ram enabling data persist without power be updated without requiring special equipment these persistent forms semiconductor rom include usb flash drives memory cards for cameras portable devices etc ecc memory which can be either sram dram includes special circuitry detect and/or correct random faults memory errors stored data using parity bits error correction code general term ram refers solely solid-state memory devices either dram sram more specifically main memory most computers optical storage term dvd-ram somewhat misnomer since unlike cd-rw dvd-rw does not need be erased before reuse nevertheless dvd-ram behaves much like hard disc drive if somewhat slower memory cell main article memory cell binary memory cell fundamental building block computer memory memory cell electronic circuit that stores one bit binary information must be set store logic high voltage level reset store logic low voltage level its value maintained/stored until changed by set/reset process value memory cell can be accessed by reading sram static ram memory cell type flip-flop circuit usually implemented using fets these require very low power when not being accessed second type dram based around capacitor charging discharging this capacitor can store '1' '0' cell however this capacitor will slowly leak away must be refreshed periodically because this refresh process dram uses more power but can achieve greater storage densities however because this greater power use silicon feature sizes have become smaller disadvantages dram's greater power use has outweighed advantages smaller size very many rams sold are now sram dram cell transistor one capacitor sram cell transistors addressing be useful memory cells must be readable writeable within ram device multiplexing demultiplexing circuitry used select memory cells typically ram device has set address lines a0 for each combination bits that may be applied these lines set memory cells are activated due this addressing ram devices virtually always have memory capacity that power two usually several memory cells share same address for example bit 'wide' ram chip has memory cells for each address often width memory that microprocessor are different for bit microprocessor eight bit ram chips would be needed often more addresses are needed than can be provided by device that case external multiplexors device are used activate correct device that being accessed memory hierarchy main article memory hierarchy one can read over-write data ram many computer systems have memory hierarchy consisting processor registers on-die sram caches external caches dram paging systems virtual memory swap space on hard drive this entire pool memory may be referred ram by many developers even though various subsystems can have very different access times violating original concept behind random access term ram even within hierarchy level such dram specific row column bank rank channel interleave organization components make access time variable although not extent that access time rotating storage media tape variable overall goal using memory hierarchy obtain highest possible average access performance while minimizing total cost entire memory system generally memory hierarchy follows access time with fast cpu registers at top slow hard drive at bottom many modern personal computers ram comes easily upgraded form modules called memory modules dram modules about size few sticks chewing gum these can quickly be replaced should they become damaged when changing needs demand more storage capacity suggested above smaller amounts ram mostly sram are also integrated cpu other ics on motherboard well hard-drives cd-roms several other parts computer system other uses ram laptop ram addition serving temporary storage working space for operating system applications ram used numerous other ways virtual memory main article virtual memory most modern operating systems employ method extending ram capacity known virtual memory portion computer's hard drive set aside for paging file scratch partition combination physical ram paging file form system's total memory for example if computer has gb ram gb page file operating system has gb total memory available when system runs low on physical memory can swap portions ram paging file make room for new data well read previously swapped information back into ram excessive use this mechanism results thrashing generally hampers overall system performance mainly because hard drives are far slower than ram ram disk main article ram drive software can partition portion computer's ram allowing act much faster hard drive that called ram disk ram disk loses stored data when computer shut down unless memory arranged have standby battery source shadow ram sometimes contents relatively slow rom chip are copied read/write memory allow for shorter access times rom chip then disabled while initialized memory locations are switched on same block addresses often write-protected this process sometimes called shadowing fairly common both computers embedded systems common example bios typical personal computers often has option called “use shadow bios” similar when enabled functions relying on data from bios’s rom will instead use dram locations most can also toggle shadowing video card rom other rom sections depending on system this may not result increased performance may cause incompatibilities for example some hardware may be inaccessible operating system if shadow ram used on some systems benefit may be hypothetical because bios not used after booting favor direct hardware access free memory reduced by size shadowed roms recent developments several new types non-volatile ram which will preserve data while powered down are under development technologies used include carbon nanotubes approaches utilizing tunnel magnetoresistance amongst 1st generation mram kib × bytes chip was manufactured with µm technology summer june infineon technologies unveiled mib × bytes prototype again based on µm technology there are two 2nd generation techniques currently development thermal-assisted switching tas which being developed by crocus technology spin-transfer torque stt on which crocus hynix ibm several other companies are working nantero built functioning carbon nanotube memory prototype gib × bytes array whether some these technologies will be able eventually take significant market share from either dram sram flash-memory technology however remains be seen since solid-state drives based on flash memory with capacities exceeding gigabytes performance far exceeding traditional disks have become available this development has started blur definition between traditional random-access memory disks dramatically reducing difference performance some kinds random-access memory such ecoram are specifically designed for server farms where low power consumption more important than speed memory wall memory wall growing disparity speed between cpu memory outside cpu chip important reason for this disparity limited communication bandwidth beyond chip boundaries which also referred bandwidth wall from cpu speed improved at annual rate 55% while memory speed only improved at 10% given these trends was expected that memory latency would become overwhelming bottleneck computer performance cpu speed improvements slowed significantly partly due major physical barriers partly because current cpu designs have already hit memory wall some sense intel summarized these causes document “first all chip geometries shrink clock frequencies rise transistor leakage current increases leading excess power consumption heat secondly advantages higher clock speeds are part negated by memory latency since memory access times have not been able keep pace with increasing clock frequencies third for certain applications traditional serial architectures are becoming less efficient processors get faster due so-called von neumann bottleneck further undercutting any gains that frequency increases might otherwise buy addition partly due limitations means producing inductance within solid state devices resistance-capacitance rc delays signal transmission are growing feature sizes shrink imposing additional bottleneck that frequency increases don't address” rc delays signal transmission were also noted clock rate versus ipc end road for conventional microarchitectures which projects maximum 125% average annual cpu performance improvement between different concept processor-memory performance gap which can be addressed by computer chips that reduce distance between logic memory aspects that are further apart chip memory subsystem design requires focus on gap which widening over time main method bridging gap use caches small amounts high-speed memory that houses recent operations instructions nearby processor speeding up execution those operations instructions cases where they are called upon frequently multiple levels caching have been developed order deal with widening gap performance high-speed modern computers are reliant on evolving caching techniques these can prevent loss processor performance takes less time perform computation has been initiated complete there can be up 53% difference between growth speed processor speeds lagging speed main memory access see also information technology portal technology portal cas latency cl hybrid memory cube multi-channel
