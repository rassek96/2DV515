manipulation objects term adventure game originated from 1970s text computer game colossal cave adventure was often referred simply adventure which pioneered style gameplay that was widely imitated became genre its own right video game genre therefore defined by its gameplay unlike literary genre which defined by subject addresses activity adventure essential elements genre include storytelling exploration puzzle solving adventure games have been described puzzles embedded narrative framework where games involve narrative content that player unlocks piece by piece over time while puzzles that players encounter through story can be arbitrary those that do not pull player out narrative are considered examples good design relationship other genres combat action challenges are limited absent adventure games thus distinguishing them from action games book andrew rollings ernest adams on game design authors state that this doesn't mean that there no conflict adventure games only that combat not primary activity some adventure games will include minigame from another video game genre which are not always appreciated by adventure game purists hybrid action-adventure games blend action adventure games throughout game experience incorporating more physical challenges than pure adventure games at faster pace this definition hard apply however with some debate among designers about which games are action games which involve enough non-physical challenges be considered action-adventures adventure games are also distinct from role-playing video games that involve action team-building points management adventure games lack numeric rules relationships seen role-playing games seldom have internal economy these games lack any skill system combat opponent be defeated through strategy tactics however some hybrid games exist here where role-playing games with strong narrative puzzle elements are considered rpg-adventures finally adventure games are classified separately from puzzle video games although adventure game may involve puzzle-solving they typically involve player-controlled avatar interactive story game design puzzle-solving adventure games contain variety puzzles decoding messages finding using items opening locked doors finding exploring new locations solving puzzle will unlock access new areas game world reveal more game story logic puzzles where mechanical devices are designed with abstract interfaces test player's deductive reasoning skills are common some puzzles are criticized for obscurity their solutions for example combination clothes line clamp deflated rubber duck used gather key stuck between subway tracks longest journey which exists outside game's narrative serves only obstacle player others have been criticized for requiring players blindly guess either by clicking on right pixel by guessing right verb games that use text interface games that require players navigate mazes have also become less popular although earliest text-adventure games usually required players draw map if they wanted navigate abstract space gathering using items many adventure games make use inventory management screen distinct gameplay mode players are only able pick up some objects game so player usually knows that only objects that can be picked up are important because can be difficult for player know if they missed important item they will often scour every scene for items for games that utilize point click device players will sometimes engage systematic search known pixel hunt games try avoid this by highlighting item by snapping player's cursor item many puzzles these games involve gathering using items from their inventory players must apply lateral thinking techniques where they apply real-world extrinsic knowledge about objects unexpected ways for example by putting deflated inner tube on cactus create slingshot which requires player realize that inner tube stretchy they may need carry items their inventory for long duration before they prove useful thus normal for adventure games test player's memory where challenge can only be overcome by recalling piece information from earlier game there seldom any time pressure for these puzzles focusing more on player's ability reason than on quick-thinking story setting themes adventure games are single-player experiences that are largely story-driven more than any other genre adventure games depend upon their story setting create compelling single-player experience they are typically set immersive environment often fantasy world try vary setting from chapter chapter add novelty interest experience comedy common theme games often script comedic responses when players attempt actions combinations that are ridiculous impossible since adventure games are driven by storytelling character development usually follows literary conventions personal emotional growth rather than new powers abilities that affect gameplay player often embarks upon quest required unravel mystery situation about which little known these types mysterious stories allow designers get around what ernest w adams calls problem amnesia where player controls protagonist but must start game without their knowledge experience story-events typically unfold player completes new challenges puzzles but order make such storytelling less mechanical new elements story may also be triggered by player movement dialogue conversation trees further information dialog tree adventure games have strong storylines with significant dialog sometimes make effective use recorded dialog narration from voice actors this genre game known for representing dialog conversation tree players are able engage non-player character by choosing line pre-written dialog from menu which triggers response from game character these conversations are often designed tree structure with players deciding between each branch dialog pursue however there are always finite number branches pursue some adventure games devolve into selecting each option one-by-one conversing with characters can reveal clues about how solve puzzles including hints about what that character would want before they will cooperate with player other conversations will have far-reaching consequences deciding disclose valuable secret that has been entrusted player characters may also be convinced reveal their own secrets either through conversation by giving them something that will benefit them goals success failure primary goal adventure games completion assigned quest early adventure games often had high scores some zork also assigned player rank text description based on their score high scores provide player with secondary goal serve indicator progression while high scores are now less common external reward systems xbox live's achievements perform similar role primary failure condition adventure games inherited from more action-oriented games player death without clearly identified enemies other genres its inclusion adventure games controversial many developers now either avoid take extra steps foreshadow death some early adventure games trapped players unwinnable situations without ending game infocom's text adventure hitchhiker's guide galaxy has been criticized for scenario where failing pick up pile junk mail at beginning game prevented

graphics animation point-and-click adventure games are those where player typically controls their character through point-and-click interface using computer mouse similar pointing device though additional control schemes may also be available player clicks move their character around interact with non-player characters often initiating conversation trees with them examine objects game's settings with their character's item inventory many point-and-click games would include list on-screen verbs describe specific actions manner text adventure but newer games have used more context-sensitive user interface elements reduce eliminate this approach often these games come down collecting items for character's inventory figuring where right time use that item player would
