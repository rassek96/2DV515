ralph baer's initial design had called for huge row switches that would allow players turn on off certain components console odyssey lacked cpu create slightly different games like tennis volleyball hockey chase magnavox replaced switch design with separate cartridges for each game although baer had sketched up ideas for cartridges that could include new components for new games carts released by magnavox all served same function switches allowed players choose from odyssey's built-in games odyssey initially sold about units making moderately successful was not until atari's arcade game pong popularized video games that public began take more notice emerging industry by autumn magnavox bowing popularity pong cancelled odyssey released scaled-down version that played only pong hockey odyssey second higher end console odyssey was released with added on-screen scoring up four players third game—smash almost simultaneously released with atari's own home pong console through sears these consoles jump-started consumer market all three new consoles used simpler designs than original odyssey did with no board game pieces extra cartridges years that followed market saw many companies rushing similar consoles market after general instrument released their inexpensive microchips each containing complete console on single chip many small developers began releasing consoles that looked different externally but internally were playing exactly same games most consoles from this era were dedicated consoles playing only games that came with console these video game consoles

mario bros became global icon starting with his nes games nintendo took unusual stance with third-party developers for its console nintendo contractually restricted third-party developers three nes titles per year forbade them from developing for other video game consoles practice ensured nintendo's market dominance prevented flood trash titles that had helped kill atari but was ruled illegal

south america master system competed with nes saw new game releases even after sega's next-generation mega drive was released brazil where strict importation laws rampant piracy kept out competitors master system outsold nes by massive margin remained popular into 1990s jack tramiel after buying atari downsizing its staff settling its legal disputes attempted bring atari back into home console market atari released smaller sleeker cheaper version their popular atari they also released atari console technologically comparable with nes backwards compatible with finally atari repackaged its 8-bit xe home computer xegs game console new consoles helped atari claw its way out debt but failed gain much market share from nintendo atari's lack funds meant that its consoles saw fewer releases

hucard format store games small size these proprietary cards allowed nec re-release console handheld game console pc engine enjoyed brisk sales japan but its north american counterpart turbografx lagged behind competition console never saw official release europe but clones north american imports were available some markets starting nec advertised their console 16-bit highlight its advances over nes this started trend all subsequent fourth generations consoles being advertised bit many people still refer this generation 16-bit generation often refer third generation 8-bit sega scaled down adapted their sega system used power arcade hits like altered beast shinobi into mega drive sold genesis north america released with near arcade-perfect port altered beast sega's console met lukewarm sales japan but skyrocketed first place pal markets made major inroads north america propelled by its effective genesis does what nintendon't marketing campaign sega capitalized on genesis's technological superiority over nes faithful ports popular arcade games competitive pricing arcade gaming company snk developed high end neo geo mvs arcade system which used interchangeable cartridges similar home consoles building on success mvs snk repackaged neogeo neo geo aes home console though technologically superior other fourth-generation consoles aes its games were prohibitively expensive which kept sales low prevented from expanding outside its niche market into serious competition with nintendo sega aes did however amass dedicated cult following allowing see new releases into 2000s fourth generation graphics chips allowed these consoles reproduce art styles that were becoming popular arcades on home computers these games often featured lavish background scenery huge characters broader color pallettes increased emphasis on dithering texture games written specifically for nes like megaman shatterhand super mario bros were able work cleverly within its limitations ports increasingly detailed arcade home computer games came up with various solutions for example when capcom released strider arcade they created entirely separate strider game for nes that only incorporated themes characters from arcade nintendo finally brought their super famicom market brought united states super nes snes year later its release marginalized turbografx neo geo but came late enough for sega sell several million consoles north america gain strong foothold same year snes was released sega released sonic hedgehog which spiked genesis sales similar space invaders on atari also by first fully licensed nfl football game was released nfl sports talk football '93 which was available only on genesis this impact on genesis sales overall interest realistic sports games would start trend licensed sports games being viewed necessary for success console us while nintendo enjoyed dominance japan sega europe competition between two was particularly fierce close north america ultimately snes outsold genesis but only after sega discontinued genesis focus on next generation consoles one trait that remains peculiar fourth generation huge number exclusive games both sega nintendo were very successful their consoles developed massive libraries games both consoles had be programmed assembly get most out them game optimized for genesis could take advantage its faster cpu sound chip game optimized for snes could take advantage its graphics its flexible clean sound chip some game series like castlevania saw separate system exclusive releases rather than attempt port one game disparate platforms when compact disc cd technology became available midway through fourth generation each company attempted integrate into their existing consoles different ways nec sega released cd add-ons their consoles form turbografx-cd sega cd but both were only moderately successful nec also released turboduo which combined turbografx-16 its turbografx-cd add-on along with ram bios upgrade from super system card into one unit snk released third version neogeo neo geo cd allowing company release its games on cheaper medium than aes's expensive cartridges but reached market after nintendo sega had already sold tens millions consoles each nintendo partnered with sony work on cd add-on for snes but deal fell apart when they realized how much control sony wanted sony would use their work with nintendo basis for their playstation game console while cds became increasingly visible part market cd-reading technology was still expensive 1990s limiting nec's sega's add-ons'

competitors had color three major franchises made their debut on game boy tetris game boy's killer application pokémon kirby with some design game boy pocket game boy light hardware game boy color changes continued production some form until enjoying better than 18-year run atari lynx included hardware-accelerated color graphics backlight ability link up sixteen units together early example network play when its competitors could only link consoles none at all but its comparatively short battery life approximately hours on set alkaline cells versus hours for game boy high price weak games library made one worst-selling handheld game systems all time with less than units sold third major handheld fourth generation was game gear featured graphics capabilities roughly comparable master system better colours but lower resolution ready made games library by using master-gear adaptor play cartridges from older console opportunity be converted into portable tv using cheap tuner adaptor but also suffered some same shortcomings lynx while sold more than twenty times many units lynx its bulky design - slightly larger than even original game boy relatively poor battery life - only little better than lynx later arrival marketplace - competing for sales amongst remaining buyers who didn't already have game boy - hampered its overall popularity despite being more closely competitive nintendo terms price breadth software library sega eventually retired game gear year before nintendo released first examples game boy color focus on nomad non-portable console products other handheld consoles released during fourth generation included turboexpress handheld version turbografx-16 released by nec game boy pocket improved model game boy released about two years before debut game boy color while turboexpress was another early pioneer color handheld gaming technology had added benefit using same game cartridges 'hucards' turbografx16 had even worse battery life than

parties similar vcr dvd players unfortunately that very structure meant that unlike its competitors who could sell console at loss all 3do manufacturers had sell for profit cheapest 3do was more expensive than snes genesis combined atari cancelled their line home computers their atari portfolio stacy laptop their handheld atari lynx when they released jaguar was all nothing gamble that ran company into ground jaguar had three processors no c libraries help developers cope with atari was ineffective at courting third parties many their first party games were poorly received while games like tempest rayman alien vs predator showed what console was capable vast majority releases underwhelmed many jaguar's games used mainly slowest but most familiar console's processors resulting titles that could easily have been released on snes genesis compete with emerging next gen consoles nintendo released donkey kong country which could display wide range tones something common fifth-generation games by limiting number hues onscreen star fox which used extra chip inside cartridge display polygon graphics sega followed suit releasing vectorman virtua racing latter which used sega virtua processor sega also released 32x add-on for genesis while their sega saturn was still development announced that they would replace genesis with neptune combination 32x genesis sell budget console alongside their upcoming saturn despite public statements from sega claiming that they would continue support genesis/32x throughout next generation sega enterprises quietly killed neptune
