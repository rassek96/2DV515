text-based operating systems such dos being text-based meant that they were relatively accessible visually impaired users requiring only additional use text-to-speech tts software for same reason following development tts software text-based games such early text-only works interactive fiction were also equally accessible users with without visual impairment since availability such software was not commonly accessible until inclusion macintalk program on apple computers library games which became accessible vision impaired spanned everything from earliest text adventure colossal cave adventure comparatively advanced works interactive fiction which had developed subsequent years although popularity this genre has waned general market video-centric games became dominant form electronic game this library still growing with freeware development by devoted enthusiasts new interactive fiction titles each year accessibility for visually impaired began change some time prior

fantasy doom blind gamers were relegated playing more mundane games such blackjack battleship video games flourished became increasingly common however amateur game designers began adapt video games for blind via sound time audio game programmers began develop audio-only games based smaller smaller degree on existing video game ideas instead focusing on possibilities game immersion feedback with sound specifically 3-dimensional positional audio binaural recording has been developed since now figures prominently for example such audio games bbbeat effect this sound played left center right channel indicate object's position virtual gaming environment generally this involves stereo panning various sound effects many which are looped serve indicators hazards objects with which user can interact volume also plays major role audio games primarily indicate object's proximity with reference user pitch sound often varied convey other information about object symbolizes voice talent used indicate menu items rather than text these parameters have allowed for creation among other genres side scrollers action adventures shooters arcade style games console audio games modern era most audio games are now developed by several small companies consisting only team people main audience remains primarily visually impaired users however game market at large gradually taking more notice

very little way audio-games one notable exception has been innovative incorporation strong audio elements several games produced by japanese video game company warp warp formerly eim was founded by musician kenji eno consisted five-man team including first-time designer fumito ueda warp developed game called real sound for sega saturn which was later ported dreamcast renamed real sound kaze no regret real sound regrets wind this game featured no visuals at all was entirely dependent upon sound discussing real sound's production eno has stated that i got tired i didn't want people think that they could predict what warp would do next also i had chance visit people who are visually disabled i learned that there are blind people who play action games course they're not able have full experience they're kind trying force themselves be able play but they're making effort so i thought that if you turn off monitor both you are just hearing game so after you finish game you can have equal conversation about with blind person that's inspiration behind this game well so sega was asking for exclusive rights game i said 'ok if you'll donate thousand saturns blind people then i'll donate thousand game along with saturns' my condition was that if sega would go for this idea i would make that game sega exclusive so that's how this happened it's been several years now course contract probably isn't valid anymore but reason that i haven't done anything with this game that i made this promise with sega back day it's exclusive because those conditions following release real sound warp again made use novel employment audio elements sega saturn game enemy zero where enemies game are invisible can only be detected through auditory clues further emphasis on aural environment derived from game's inclusion soundtrack created by minimalist musicologist michael nyman audio-specific elements used gameplay have been recognized warp's d series including d d2 which both
