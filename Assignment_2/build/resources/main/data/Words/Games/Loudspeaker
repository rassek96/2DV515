speakers using piezoelectric electrostatic systems any several other sorts history johann philipp reis installed electric loudspeaker his telephone was capable reproducing clear tones but also could reproduce muffled speech after few revisions alexander graham bell patented his first electric loudspeaker capable reproducing intelligible speech part his telephone which was followed by improved version from ernst siemens during this time thomas edison was issued british patent for system using compressed air amplifying mechanism for his early cylinder phonographs but he ultimately settled for familiar metal horn driven by membrane attached stylus horace short patented design for loudspeaker driven by compressed air he then sold rights charles parsons who was issued several additional british patents before few companies including victor talking machine company pathé produced record players using compressed-air loudspeakers however these designs were significantly limited by their poor sound quality their inability reproduce sound at low volume variants system were used for public address applications more recently other variations have been used test space-equipment resistance very loud sound vibration levels that launching rockets produces first experimental moving-coil also called dynamic loudspeaker was invented by oliver lodge first practical moving-coil loudspeakers were manufactured by danish engineer peter l jensen edwin pridham napa california like previous loudspeakers these used horns amplify sound produced by small diaphragm jensen was denied patents being unsuccessful selling their product telephone companies they changed their target market radios public address systems named their product magnavox jensen was for years after invention loudspeaker part owner magnavox company kellogg rice holding large driver first moving-coil cone loudspeaker prototype moving-coil cone loudspeaker by kellogg rice with electromagnet pulled back showing voice coil

patented by chester w rice edward w kellogg key difference between previous attempts patent by rice kellogg adjustment mechanical parameters so that fundamental resonance moving system below frequency where cone's radiation impedance becomes uniform about this same period walter h schottky invented first ribbon loudspeaker together with dr erwin gerlach these first loudspeakers used electromagnets because large powerful permanent magnets were generally not available at reasonable price coil electromagnet called field coil was energized by current through second pair connections driver this winding usually served dual role acting also choke coil filtering power supply amplifier that loudspeaker was connected ac ripple current was attenuated by action passing through choke coil however ac line frequencies tended modulate audio signal going voice coil added audible hum jensen introduced first commercial fixed-magnet loudspeaker however large heavy iron magnets day were impractical field-coil speakers remained predominant until widespread availability lightweight alnico magnets after world war ii 1930s loudspeaker manufacturers began combine two three bandpasses' worth drivers order increase frequency response sound pressure level first film industry-standard loudspeaker system shearer horn system for theatres two-way system was introduced by metro-goldwyn-mayer used four 15″ low-frequency drivers crossover network set for hz single multi-cellular horn with two compression drivers providing high frequencies john kenneth hilliard james bullough lansing douglas shearer all played roles creating system at new york world's fair very large two-way public address system was mounted on tower at flushing meadows eight 27″ low-frequency drivers were designed by rudy bozak his role chief engineer for cinaudagraph high-frequency drivers were likely made by western electric altec lansing introduced which became their most famous coaxial duplex driver incorporated high-frequency horn that sent sound through middle 15-inch woofer for near-point-source performance altec's voice theatre loudspeaker system arrived marketplace offering better coherence clarity at high output levels necessary movie theaters academy motion picture arts sciences immediately began testing its sonic characteristics they made film house industry standard edgar villchur developed acoustic suspension principle loudspeaker design cambridge massachusetts this allowed for better bass response than previously from drivers mounted smaller cabinets which was important during transition stereo recording reproduction he his partner henry kloss formed acoustic research company manufacture market speaker systems using this principle subsequently continuous developments

applied electrical signal coming from amplifier following description individual components this type loudspeaker diaphragm usually manufactured with cone- dome-shaped profile variety different materials may be used but most common are paper plastic metal ideal material would be rigid prevent uncontrolled cone motions have low mass minimize starting force requirements energy storage issues be well damped reduce vibrations continuing after signal has stopped with little no audible ringing due its resonance frequency determined by its usage practice all three these criteria cannot be met simultaneously using existing materials thus driver design involves trade-offs for example paper light typically well damped but not stiff metal may be stiff light but usually has poor damping plastic can be light but typically stiffer made poorer damping result many cones are made some sort composite material for example cone might be made cellulose paper into which some carbon fiber kevlar glass hemp bamboo fibers have been added might use honeycomb sandwich construction coating might be applied so provide additional stiffening damping chassis frame basket designed be rigid avoiding deformation that could change critical alignments with magnet gap perhaps causing voice coil rub against sides gap chassis are typically cast from aluminum alloy stamped from thin steel sheet though some drivers with large magnets cast chassis are preferable sheet metal can easily be warped whenever loudspeaker subjected rough handling other materials such molded plastic damped plastic compound baskets are becoming common especially for inexpensive low-mass drivers metallic chassis can play important role conducting heat away from voice coil heating during operation changes resistance causes physical dimensional changes if extreme may even demagnetize permanent magnets suspension system keeps coil centered gap provides restoring centering force that returns cone neutral position after moving typical suspension system consists two parts spider which connects diaphragm voice coil frame provides majority restoring force surround which helps center coil/cone assembly allows free pistonic motion aligned with magnetic gap spider usually made corrugated fabric disk impregnated with stiffening resin name comes from shape early suspensions which were two concentric rings bakelite material joined by six eight curved legs variations this topology included addition felt disc provide barrier particles that might otherwise cause voice coil rub german firm rulik still offers drivers with uncommon spiders made wood cone surround can be rubber polyester foam ring corrugated resin coated fabric attached both outer diaphragm circumference frame these diverse surround materials their shape treatment can dramatically affect acoustic output driver each implementation having advantages disadvantages polyester foam for example lightweight economical though usually leaking air some degree but degraded by exposure ozone uv light humidity elevated temperatures significantly limiting useful life with adequate performance wire voice coil usually made copper though aluminum—and rarely silver—may be used advantage aluminum its light weight which raises resonant frequency voice coil allows respond more easily higher frequencies disadvantage aluminum that not easily soldered so connections are instead often crimped together sealed these connections must be made well they may fail intense environment mechanical vibration voice-coil wire cross sections can be circular rectangular hexagonal giving varying amounts wire volume coverage magnetic gap space coil oriented co-axially inside gap moves back forth within small circular volume hole slot groove magnetic structure gap establishes concentrated magnetic field between two poles permanent magnet outside gap being one pole center post called pole piece being other pole piece backplate are often single piece called poleplate yoke modern driver magnets are almost always permanent made ceramic ferrite alnico more recently rare earth such neodymium samarium cobalt electrodynamic drivers were often used musical instrument amplifier/speaker cabinets well into 1950s there were economic savings those using tube amplifiers field coil could usually did do double duty power supply choke trend design — due increases transportation costs desire for smaller lighter devices many home theater multi-speaker installations — use last instead heavier ferrite types very few manufacturers still produce electrodynamic loudspeakers with electrically powered field coils was common earliest designs one last french firm when high field-strength permanent magnets became available after wwii alnico alloy aluminum nickel cobalt became popular since dispensed with problems field-coil drivers alnico was used almost exclusively until about despite embarrassing problem alnico magnets being partially degaussed ie demagnetized by accidental 'pops' 'clicks' caused by loose connections especially if used with high-power amplifier damage can be reversed by recharging magnet but this requires uncommon specialist equipment knowledge after most but not quite all driver manufacturers switched from alnico ferrite magnets which are made from mix ceramic clay fine particles barium strontium ferrite although energy per kilogram these ceramic magnets lower than alnico substantially less expensive allowing designers use larger yet more economical magnets achieve given performance size type magnet details magnetic circuit differ depending on design goals for instance shape pole piece affects magnetic interaction between voice coil magnetic field sometimes used modify driver's behavior shorting ring faraday loop may be included thin copper cap fitted over pole tip heavy ring situated within magnet-pole cavity benefits this complication reduced impedance at high frequencies providing extended treble output reduced harmonic distortion reduction inductance modulation that typically accompanies large voice coil excursions on other hand copper cap requires wider voice-coil gap with increased magnetic reluctance this reduces available flux requiring larger magnet for equivalent performance driver design—including particular way two more drivers are combined enclosure make speaker system—is both art involving subjective perceptions timbre sound quality science involving measurements experiments adjusting design improve performance done using combination magnetic acoustic mechanical electrical material science theory tracked with high precision measurements observations experienced listeners few issues speaker driver designers must confront are distortion radiation lobing phase effects off-axis response crossover artifacts designers can use anechoic chamber ensure speaker can be measured independently room effects any several electronic techniques that some extent substitute for such chambers some developers eschew anechoic chambers favor specific standardized room setups intended simulate real-life listening conditions fabrication finished loudspeaker systems has become segmented depending largely on price shipping costs weight limitations high-end speaker systems which are typically heavier often larger than economic shipping allows outside local regions are usually

locations driver types four-way high fidelity loudspeaker system each four drivers outputs different frequency range fifth aperture at bottom bass reflex port individual electrodynamic drivers provide their best performance within limited frequency range multiple drivers eg subwoofers woofers mid-range drivers tweeters are generally combined into complete loudspeaker system provide performance beyond that constraint three most commonly used sound radiation systems are cone dome horn type drivers full-range drivers main article full-range speaker full-range driver speaker designed be used alone reproduce audio channel without help other drivers therefore must cover entire audio frequency range these drivers are small typically inches cm diameter permit reasonable high frequency response carefully designed give low-distortion output at low frequencies though with reduced maximum output level full-range more accurately wide-range drivers are most commonly heard public address systems televisions although some models are suitable for hi-fi listening small radios intercoms some computer speakers etc hi-fi speaker systems use wide-range drive units can avoid undesirable interactions between multiple drivers caused by non-coincident driver location crossover network issues fans wide-range driver hi-fi speaker systems claim coherence sound due single source resulting lack interference likely also lack crossover components detractors typically cite wide-range drivers' limited frequency response modest output abilities most especially at low frequencies together with their requirement for large elaborate expensive enclosures—such transmission lines quarter wave resonators horns—to approach optimum performance with advent neodymium drivers low cost quarter wave transmission lines are made possible are increasingly made availably commercially full-range drivers often employ additional cone called whizzer small light cone attached joint between voice coil primary cone whizzer cone extends high-frequency response driver broadens its high frequency directivity which would otherwise be greatly narrowed due outer diameter cone material failing keep up with central voice coil at higher frequencies main cone whizzer design manufactured so flex more outer diameter than center result that main cone delivers low frequencies whizzer cone contributes most higher frequencies since whizzer cone smaller than main diaphragm output dispersion at high frequencies improved relative equivalent single larger diaphragm limited-range drivers also used alone are typically found computers toys clock radios these drivers are less elaborate less expensive than wide-range drivers they may be severely compromised fit into very small mounting locations these applications sound quality low priority human ear remarkably tolerant poor sound quality distortion inherent limited-range drivers may enhance their output at high frequencies increasing clarity when listening spoken word material subwoofer main article subwoofer subwoofer woofer driver used only for lowest-pitched part audio spectrum typically below hz for consumer systems below hz for professional live sound below hz thx-approved systems because intended range frequencies limited subwoofer system design usually simpler many respects than for conventional loudspeakers often consisting single driver enclosed suitable box enclosure since sound this frequency range can easily bend around corners by diffraction speaker aperture does not have face audience subwoofers can be mounted bottom enclosure facing floor this eased by limitations human hearing at low frequencies such sounds cannot be located space due their large wavelengths compared higher frequencies which produce differential effects ears due shadowing by head diffraction around both which we rely upon for localization clues accurately reproduce very low bass notes without unwanted resonances typically from cabinet panels subwoofer systems must be solidly constructed properly braced avoid unwanted sounds cabinet vibrations result good subwoofers are typically quite heavy many subwoofer systems include integrated power amplifiers electronic subsonic sub-filters with additional controls relevant low-frequency reproduction eg crossover knob phase switch these variants are known active powered subwoofers with former including power amplifier contrast passive subwoofers require external amplification typical installations subwoofers are physically separated from rest speaker cabinets because propagation delay their output may be somewhat out phase from another subwoofer on another channel slightly out phase with rest sound consequently subwoofer's power amp often has phase-delay adjustment approximately ms delay required for each additional foot separation from listener which may improve performance system whole at subwoofer frequencies perhaps octave so above crossover point however influence room resonances sometimes called standing waves typically so large that such issues are secondary practice subwoofers are widely used large concert mid-sized venue sound reinforcement systems subwoofer cabinets are often built with bass reflex port hole cut into cabinet with tube attached design feature that improves bass performance increases efficiency woofer main article woofer woofer driver that reproduces low frequencies driver works with characteristics enclosure produce suitable low frequencies see speaker enclosure for some design choices available indeed both are so closely connected that they must be considered together use only at design time do separate properties enclosure woofer matter individually some loudspeaker systems use woofer for lowest frequencies sometimes well enough that subwoofer not needed additionally some loudspeakers use woofer handle middle frequencies eliminating mid-range driver this can be accomplished with selection tweeter that can work low enough that combined with woofer that responds high enough two drivers add coherently middle frequencies mid-range driver main article mid-range speaker mid-range speaker loudspeaker driver that reproduces band frequencies generally between 1-6 khz otherwise known 'mid' frequencies between woofer tweeter mid-range driver diaphragms can be made paper composite materials

genelec system design electronic symbol for speaker crossover main article audio crossover passive crossover bi-amped used multi-driver speaker systems crossover subsystem that separates input signal into different frequency ranges suited each driver drivers receive power only their usable frequency range range they were designed for thereby reducing distortion drivers interference between them no crossover can be perfect ie absolute block at edges passband no amplitude variation within passband no phase changes across frequency band boundaries crossover establishes so this idealized description crossovers can be passive active passive crossover electronic circuit that uses combination one more resistors inductors non-polar capacitors these parts are formed into carefully designed networks are most often placed between full frequency-range power amplifier loudspeaker drivers divide amplifier's signal into necessary frequency bands before being delivered individual drivers passive crossover circuits need no external power beyond audio signal itself but have disadvantages high cost large components inductors capacitors limited ability adjust circuit desired due limited choice high-power-level components etc they also cause substantial overall signal loss significant reduction damping factor between voice coil crossover active crossover electronic filter circuit that divides signal into individual frequency bands before power amplification thus requiring at least one power amplifier for each bandpass passive filtering may also be used this way before power amplification but uncommon solution being less flexible than active filtering any technique that uses crossover filtering followed by amplification commonly known bi-amping tri-amping quad-amping so on depending on minimum number amplifier channels some loudspeaker designs use combination passive active crossover filtering such passive crossover between mid- high-frequency drivers active crossover between low-frequency driver combined mid- high frequencies passive crossovers are commonly installed inside speaker boxes are by far most usual type crossover for home low-power use car audio systems passive crossovers may be separate box necessary accommodate size components used passive crossovers may be simple for low-order filtering complex allow steep slopes such db per octave passive crossovers can also be designed compensate for undesired characteristics driver horn enclosure resonances can be tricky implement due component interaction passive crossovers like driver units that they feed have power handling limits have insertion losses 10% often claimed change load seen by amplifier changes are matters concern for many hi-fi world when high output levels are required active crossovers may be preferable active crossovers may be simple circuits that emulate response passive network may be more complex allowing extensive audio adjustments some active crossovers usually digital loudspeaker management systems may include electronics controls for precise alignment phase time between frequency bands equalization dynamics audio compression limiting control enclosures main article loudspeaker enclosure unusual three-way speaker system cabinet narrow raise frequency where diffraction effect called baffle step occurs most loudspeaker systems consist drivers mounted enclosure cabinet role enclosure prevent sound waves emanating from back driver from interfering destructively with those from front sound waves emitted from back are 180° out phase with those emitted forward so without enclosure they typically cause cancellations which significantly degrade level quality sound at low frequencies simplest driver mount flat panel ie baffle with drivers mounted holes however this approach sound frequencies with wavelength longer than baffle dimensions are canceled out because antiphase radiation from rear cone interferes with radiation from front with infinitely large panel this interference could be entirely prevented sufficiently large sealed box can approach this behavior since panels infinite dimensions are impossible most enclosures function by containing rear radiation from moving diaphragm sealed enclosure prevents transmission sound emitted from rear loudspeaker by confining sound rigid airtight box techniques used reduce transmission sound through walls cabinet include thicker cabinet walls lossy wall material internal bracing curved cabinet walls—or more rarely visco-elastic materials eg mineral-loaded bitumen thin lead sheeting applied interior enclosure walls however rigid enclosure reflects sound internally which can then be transmitted back through loudspeaker diaphragm—again resulting degradation sound quality this can be reduced by internal absorption using absorptive materials often called damping such glass wool wool synthetic fiber batting within enclosure internal shape enclosure can also be designed reduce this by reflecting sounds away from loudspeaker diaphragm where they may then be absorbed other enclosure types alter rear sound radiation so can add constructively output from front cone designs that do this including bass reflex passive radiator transmission line etc are often used extend effective low-frequency response increase low-frequency output driver make transition between drivers seamless possible system designers have attempted time-align phase adjust drivers by moving one more driver mounting locations forward back so that acoustic center each driver same vertical plane this may also involve tilting face speaker back providing separate enclosure mounting for each driver less commonly using electronic techniques achieve same effect these attempts have resulted some unusual cabinet designs speaker mounting scheme including cabinets can also cause diffraction resulting peaks dips frequency response problem usually greatest at higher frequencies where wavelengths are similar smaller than cabinet dimensions effect can be minimized by rounding front edges cabinet curving cabinet itself using smaller narrower enclosure choosing strategic driver arrangement using absorptive material around driver some combination these other schemes horn loudspeakers three-way loudspeaker that uses horns front each three drivers shallow horn for tweeter long straight horn for mid frequencies folded horn for woofer main article horn loudspeaker horn loudspeakers are oldest form loudspeaker system use horns voice-amplifying megaphones dates at least 17th century horns were used mechanical gramophones early horn loudspeakers use shaped waveguide front behind driver increase directivity loudspeaker transform small diameter high pressure condition at

cross-sectional mouth area required create bass sub-bass horn require horn many feet long 'folded' horns can reduce total size but compel designers make compromises accept increased complication such cost construction some horn designs not only fold low frequency horn but use walls room corner extension horn mouth late 1940s horns whose mouths took up much room wall were not unknown amongst hi-fi fans room sized installations became much less acceptable when two more were required horn loaded speaker can have sensitivity high db at volts watt at ohms at meter this hundredfold increase output

may be given rated power – nominal even continuous power peak maximum short-term power loudspeaker can handle ie maximum input power before destroying loudspeaker never sound output loudspeaker produces driver may be damaged at much less than its rated power if driven past its mechanical limits at lower frequencies tweeters can also be damaged by amplifier clipping amplifier circuits produce large amounts energy at high frequencies such cases by music sine wave input at high frequencies each these situations might pass more energy tweeter than can survive without damage some jurisdictions power handling has legal meaning allowing comparisons between loudspeakers under consideration elsewhere variety meanings for power handling capacity can be quite confusing impedance – typically ω ohms ω etc baffle enclosure type enclosed systems only – sealed bass reflex etc number drivers complete speaker systems only – two-way three-way etc optionally crossover frequencyies multi-driver systems only – nominal frequency boundaries division between drivers frequency response – measured specified output over specified range frequencies for constant input level varied across those frequencies sometimes includes variance limit such within ± db thiele/small parameters individual drivers only – these include driver's fs resonance frequency qts driver's q more less its damping factor at resonant frequency vas equivalent air compliance volume driver etc sensitivity – sound pressure level produced by loudspeaker non-reverberant environment often specified db measured at meter with input watt rms volts into ω typically at one more specified frequencies manufacturers often use this rating marketing material maximum sound pressure level – highest output loudspeaker can manage short damage not exceeding particular distortion level manufacturers often use this rating marketing material—commonly without reference frequency range distortion level electrical characteristics dynamic loudspeakers main article electrical characteristics dynamic loudspeakers load that driver presents amplifier consists complex electrical impedance—a combination resistance both capacitive inductive reactance which combines properties driver its mechanical motion effects crossover components if any are signal path between amplifier driver effects air loading on driver modified by enclosure its environment most amplifiers' output specifications are given at specific power into ideal resistive load however loudspeaker does not have constant resistance across its frequency range instead voice coil inductive driver has mechanical resonances enclosure changes driver's electrical mechanical characteristics passive crossover between drivers amplifier contributes its own variations result load resistance that varies widely with frequency usually varying phase relationship between voltage current well also changing with frequency some amplifiers can cope with variation better than others can make sound loudspeaker driven by modulated electric current produced by amplifier that pass through speaker coil which then through inductance creates magnetic field around coil creating magnetic field electric current variations that pass through speaker are thus converted varying magnetic field whose interaction with driver's magnetic field moves speaker diaphragm which thus forces driver produce air motion that similar original signal from amplifier electromechanical measurements examples typical measurements are amplitude phase characteristics vs frequency impulse response under one more conditions eg square waves sine wave bursts etc directivity vs frequency eg horizontally vertically spherically etc harmonic intermodulation distortion vs sound pressure level spl output using any several test signals stored energy ie ringing at various frequencies impedance vs frequency small-signal vs large-signal performance most these measurements require sophisticated often expensive equipment perform also good judgment by operator but raw sound pressure level output rather easier report so often only specified value—sometimes misleadingly exact terms sound pressure level spl loudspeaker produces measured decibels dbspl efficiency vs sensitivity loudspeaker efficiency defined sound power output divided by electrical power input most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers only about 1% electrical energy sent by amplifier typical home loudspeaker converted acoustic energy remainder converted heat mostly voice coil magnet assembly main reason for this difficulty achieving proper impedance matching between acoustic impedance drive unit air radiates into at low frequencies improving this match main purpose speaker enclosure designs efficiency loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency well for instance output woofer driver decreases input frequency decreases because increasingly poor match between air driver driver ratings based on spl for given input are called sensitivity ratings are notionally similar efficiency sensitivity usually defined so many decibels at w electrical input measured at meter except for headphones often at single frequency voltage used often vrms which watt into ω nominal speaker impedance approximately true for many speaker systems measurements taken with this reference are quoted db with v @ m sound pressure output measured at mathematically scaled be equivalent measurement taken at one meter from loudspeaker on-axis directly front under condition that loudspeaker radiating into infinitely large space mounted on infinite baffle clearly then sensitivity does not correlate precisely with efficiency also depends on directivity driver being tested acoustic environment front actual loudspeaker for example cheerleader's horn produces more sound output direction pointed by concentrating sound waves from cheerleader one direction thus focusing them horn also improves impedance matching between voice air which produces more acoustic power for given speaker power some cases improved impedance matching via careful enclosure design lets speaker produce more acoustic power typical home loudspeakers have sensitivities about db for w @ m—an efficiency 05–4% sound reinforcement public address loudspeakers have sensitivities perhaps db for w @ m—an efficiency 4–10% rock concert stadium pa marine hailing etc speakers generally have higher sensitivities db for w @ m—an efficiency 10–20% driver with higher maximum power rating cannot necessarily be driven louder levels than lower-rated one since sensitivity power handling are largely independent properties examples that follow assume for simplicity that drivers being compared have same electrical impedance are operated at same frequency within both driver's respective pass bands that power compression distortion are low for first example speaker db more sensitive than another produces double sound power db louder for same power input thus w driver rated at db for w @ m sensitivity puts out twice much acoustic power w driver b rated at db for w @ m when both are driven with w input power this particular example when driven at w speaker produces same spl loudness speaker b would produce with w input thus db increase sensitivity speaker means that needs half amplifier power achieve given spl this translates into smaller less complex power amplifier—and often reduced overall system cost typically not possible combine high efficiency especially at low frequencies with compact enclosure size adequate low frequency response one can for most part choose only two three parameters when designing speaker system so for example if extended low-frequency performance small box size are important one must accept low efficiency this rule thumb sometimes called hofmann's iron law after ja hofmann h klh listening environment main article room acoustics at jay pritzker pavilion lares system combined with zoned sound reinforcement system both suspended on overhead steel trellis synthesize indoor acoustic environment outdoors interaction loudspeaker system with its environment complex largely out loudspeaker designer's control most listening rooms present more less reflective environment depending on size shape volume furnishings this means sound reaching listener's ears consists not only sound directly from speaker system but also same sound delayed by traveling from being modified by one more surfaces these reflected sound waves when added direct sound cause cancellation addition at assorted frequencies eg from resonant room modes thus changing timbre character sound at listener's ears human brain very sensitive small variations including some these this part reason why loudspeaker system sounds different at different listening positions different rooms significant factor sound loudspeaker system amount absorption diffusion present environment clapping one's hands typical empty room without draperies carpet produces zippy fluttery echo due both lack absorption reverberation that repeated echoes from flat reflective walls floor ceiling addition hard surfaced furniture wall hangings shelving even baroque plaster ceiling decoration changes echoes primarily because diffusion caused by reflective objects with shapes surfaces having sizes on order sound wavelengths this somewhat breaks up simple reflections otherwise caused by bare flat surfaces spreads reflected energy incident wave over larger angle on reflection placement typical rectangular listening room hard parallel surfaces walls floor ceiling cause primary acoustic resonance nodes each three dimensions left-right up-down forward-backward furthermore there are more complex resonance modes involving three four five even all six boundary surfaces combining create standing waves low frequencies excite these modes most since long wavelengths are not much affected by furniture compositions placement mode spacing critical especially small medium size rooms like recording studios home theaters broadcast studios proximity loudspeakers room boundaries affects how strongly resonances are excited well affecting relative strength at each frequency location listener critical too position near boundary can have great effect on perceived balance frequencies this because standing wave patterns are most easily heard these locations at lower frequencies below schroeder frequency – typically around 200–300 hz depending on room size directivity acousticians studying radiation sound sources have developed some concepts important understanding how loudspeakers are perceived simplest possible radiating source point source sometimes called simple source ideal point source infinitesimally small point radiating sound may be easier imagine tiny pulsating sphere uniformly increasing decreasing diameter sending out sound waves all directions equally independent frequency any object radiating sound including loudspeaker system can be thought being composed combinations such simple point sources radiation pattern combination point sources not same for single

frequency increases sound from such source focuses into increasingly narrower angle smaller driver higher frequency where this narrowing directivity occurs even if diaphragm not perfectly circular this effect occurs such that larger sources are more directive several loudspeaker designs approximate this behavior most are electrostatic planar magnetic designs various manufacturers use different driver mounting arrangements create specific type sound field space for which they are designed resulting radiation patterns may be intended more closely simulate way sound produced by real instruments simply create controlled energy distribution from input signal some using this approach are called monitors they are useful checking signal just recorded studio example first room corner system with many small drivers on surface 1/8 sphere system design this type was patented produced commercially by professor amar bose—the later bose models have deliberately emphasized production both direct reflected sound by loudspeaker itself regardless its environment designs are controversial high fidelity circles but have proven commercially successful several other manufacturers' designs follow similar principles directivity important issue because affects frequency balance sound listener hears also interaction speaker system with room its contents very directive sometimes termed 'beamy' speaker ie on axis perpendicular speaker face may result reverberant field lacking high frequencies giving impression speaker deficient treble even though measures well on axis eg flat across entire frequency range speakers with very wide rapidly increasing directivity at high frequencies can give impression that there too much treble if listener on axis too little if listener off axis this part reason why on-axis frequency response measurement not complete characterization sound given loudspeaker other speaker designs while dynamic cone speakers remain most popular choice many other speaker technologies exist with diaphragm moving-iron loudspeakers main article moving iron speaker moving iron speaker moving iron speaker was first type speaker that was invented unlike newer dynamic moving coil design moving-iron speaker uses stationary coil vibrate magnetized piece metal called iron reed armature metal either attached diaphragm diaphragm itself this design was original loudspeaker design dating back early telephone moving iron drivers are inefficient can only produce small band sound they require large magnets coils increase force balanced armature drivers type moving iron driver use armature that moves like see-saw diving board since they are not damped they are highly efficient but they also produce strong resonances they are still used today for high end earphones hearing aids where small size high efficiency are important piezoelectric speakers main article piezoelectric speaker see also piezo tweeter piezoelectric buzzer white ceramic piezoelectric material can be seen fixed metal diaphragm piezoelectric speakers are frequently used beepers watches other electronic devices are sometimes used tweeters less-expensive speaker systems such computer speakers portable radios piezoelectric speakers have several advantages over conventional loudspeakers they are resistant overloads that would normally destroy most high frequency drivers they can be used without crossover due their electrical properties there are also disadvantages some amplifiers can oscillate when driving capacitive loads like most piezoelectrics which results distortion damage amplifier additionally their frequency response most cases inferior that other technologies this why they are generally used single frequency beeper non-critical applications piezoelectric speakers can have extended high frequency output this useful some specialized circumstances for instance sonar applications which piezoelectric variants are used both output devices generating underwater sound input devices acting sensing components underwater microphones they have advantages these applications not least which simple solid state construction that resists seawater better than ribbon cone based device would kyocera introduced piezoelectric ultra-thin medium-size film speakers with only milimeter thickness grams weight for their oled televisions they hope speakers will also be used pcs tablets besides medium-size there are also large small sizes which can all produce relatively same quality sound volume within degrees highly responsive speaker material provides better clarity than traditional tv speakers magnetostatic loudspeakers main article magnetostatic loudspeaker magnetostatic loudspeaker instead voice coil driving speaker cone magnetostatic speaker uses array metal strips bonded large film membrane magnetic field produced by signal current flowing through strips interacts with field permanent bar magnets mounted behind them force produced moves membrane so air front typically these designs are less efficient than conventional moving-coil speakers magnetostrictive speakers magnetostrictive transducers based on magnetostriction have been predominantly used sonar ultrasonic sound wave radiators but their use has spread also audio speaker systems magnetostrictive speaker drivers have some special advantages they can provide greater force with smaller excursions than other technologies low excursion can avoid distortions from large excursion other designs magnetizing coil stationary therefore more easily cooled they are robust because delicate suspensions voice coils are not required magnetostrictive speaker modules have been produced by fostex feonic subwoofer drivers have also been produced electrostatic loudspeakers main article electrostatic loudspeaker schematic showing electrostatic speaker's construction its connections thickness diaphragm grids has been exaggerated for purpose illustration electrostatic loudspeakers use high voltage electric field rather than magnetic field drive thin statically charged membrane because they are driven over entire membrane surface rather than from small voice coil they ordinarily provide more linear lower-distortion motion than dynamic drivers they also have relatively narrow dispersion pattern that can make for precise sound-field positioning however their optimum listening area small they are not very efficient speakers they have disadvantage that diaphragm excursion severely limited because practical construction limitations—the further apart stators are positioned higher voltage must be achieve acceptable efficiency this increases tendency for electrical arcs well increasing speaker's attraction dust particles arcing remains potential problem with current technologies especially when panels are allowed collect dust dirt are driven with high signal levels electrostatics are inherently dipole radiators due thin flexible membrane are less suited for use enclosures reduce low frequency cancellation with common cone drivers due this low excursion capability full range electrostatic loudspeakers are large by nature bass rolls off at frequency corresponding quarter wavelength narrowest panel dimension reduce size commercial products they are sometimes used high frequency driver combination with conventional dynamic driver that handles bass frequencies effectively electrostatics are usually driven through step-up transformer that multiplies voltage swings produced by power amplifier this transformer also multiplies capacitive load that inherent electrostatic transducers which means effective impedance presented power amplifiers varies widely by frequency speaker that nominally ohms may actually present load ohm at higher frequencies which challenging some amplifier designs ribbon planar magnetic loudspeakers ribbon speaker consists thin metal-film ribbon suspended magnetic field electrical signal applied ribbon which moves with create sound advantage ribbon driver that ribbon has very little mass thus can accelerate very quickly yielding very good high-frequency response ribbon loudspeakers are often very fragile—some can be torn by strong gust air most ribbon tweeters emit sound dipole pattern few have backings that limit dipole radiation pattern above below ends more less rectangular ribbon there less audible output due phase cancellation but precise amount directivity depends on ribbon length ribbon designs generally require exceptionally powerful magnets which makes them costly manufacture ribbons have very low resistance that most amplifiers cannot drive directly result step down transformer typically used increase current through ribbon amplifier sees load that ribbon's resistance times transformer turns ratio squared transformer must be carefully designed so that its frequency response parasitic losses do not degrade sound further increasing cost complication relative conventional designs planar magnetic speakers having printed embedded conductors on flat diaphragm are sometimes described ribbons but are not truly ribbon speakers term planar generally reserved for speakers with roughly rectangular flat surfaces that radiate bipolar ie front back manner planar magnetic speakers consist flexible membrane with voice coil printed mounted on current flowing through coil interacts with magnetic field carefully placed magnets on either side diaphragm causing membrane vibrate more less uniformly without much bending wrinkling driving force covers large percentage membrane surface reduces resonance problems inherent coil-driven flat diaphragms bending wave loudspeakers bending wave transducers use diaphragm that intentionally flexible rigidity material increases from center outside short wavelengths radiate primarily from inner area while longer waves reach edge speaker prevent reflections from outside back into center long waves are absorbed by surrounding damper such transducers can cover wide frequency range hz hz have been promoted being close ideal point sound source this uncommon approach being taken by only very few manufacturers very different arrangements ohm walsh loudspeakers use unique driver designed by lincoln walsh who had been radar development engineer wwii he became interested audio equipment design his last project was unique one-way speaker using single driver cone faced down into sealed airtight enclosure rather than move back-and-forth conventional speakers do cone rippled created sound manner known rf electronics transmission line new speaker created cylindrical sound field lincoln walsh died before his speaker was released public ohm acoustics firm has produced several loudspeaker models using walsh driver design since then german physiks audio equipment firm germany also produces speakers using this approach german firm manger has designed produced bending wave driver that at first glance appears conventional fact round panel attached voice coil bends carefully controlled way produce full range sound josef w manger was awarded with diesel medal for extraordinary developments inventions by german institute inventions flat panel loudspeakers there have been many attempts reduce size speaker systems alternatively make them less obvious one such attempt was development exciter transducer coils mounted flat panels act sound sources most accurately called exciter/panel drivers these can then be made neutral color hung on walls where they are less noticeable than many speakers can be deliberately painted with patterns which case they can function decoratively there are two related problems with flat panel techniques first flat panel necessarily more flexible than cone shape same material therefore moves single unit even less second resonances panel are difficult control leading considerable distortions some progress has been made using such lightweight rigid materials such styrofoam there have been several flat panel systems commercially produced recent years heil air motion transducers main article air motion transformer heil's air motion transducer current through membrane causes move left right magnetic field moving air out along directions barriers prevent air from moving unintended directions oskar heil invented air motion transducer 1960s this approach pleated diaphragm mounted magnetic field forced close open under control music signal air forced from between pleats accordance with imposed signal generating sound drivers are less fragile than ribbons considerably more efficient able produce higher absolute output levels than ribbon electrostatic planar magnetic tweeter designs ess california manufacturer licensed design employed heil produced range speaker systems
