engine notable compilers & toolchains llvm gnu compiler collection gcc v t e computing just-in-time jit compilation also known dynamic translation compilation done during execution program – at run time – rather than prior execution most often this consists translation machine code which then executed directly but can also refer translation another format system implementing jit compiler typically continuously analyses code being executed identifies parts code where speedup gained from compilation would outweigh overhead compiling that code jit compilation combination two traditional approaches translation machine code – ahead-of-time compilation aot interpretation – combines some advantages drawbacks both roughly jit compilation combines speed compiled code with flexibility interpretation with overhead interpreter additional overhead compiling not just interpreting jit compilation form dynamic compilation allows adaptive optimization such dynamic recompilation – thus theory jit compilation can yield faster execution than static compilation interpretation jit compilation are particularly suited for dynamic programming languages runtime system can handle late-bound data types enforce security guarantees contents applications overview startup delay optimizations history security see also references external links applications jit compilation can be applied some programs can be used for certain capacities particularly dynamic capacities such regular expressions for example text editor may compile regular expression provided at runtime machine code allow faster matching – this cannot be done ahead time data only provided at runtime several modern runtime environments rely on jit compilation for high-speed code execution including most implementations java together with microsoft's net framework similarly many regular expression libraries feature jit compilation regular expressions either bytecode machine code common implementation jit compilation first have aot compilation bytecode virtual machine code known bytecode compilation then have jit compilation machine code dynamic compilation rather than interpretation bytecode this improves runtime performance compared interpretation at cost lag due compilation jit compilers translate continuously with interpreters but caching compiled code minimizes lag on future execution same code during given run since only part program compiled there significantly less lag than if entire program were compiled prior execution overview bytecode-compiled system source code translated intermediate representation known bytecode bytecode not machine code for any particular computer may be portable among computer architectures bytecode may then be interpreted by run on virtual machine jit compiler reads bytecodes many sections full rarely compiles them dynamically into machine language so program can run faster this can be done per-file per-function even on any arbitrary code fragment code can be compiled when about be executed hence name just-in-time then cached reused later without needing be recompiled contrast traditional interpreted virtual machine will simply interpret bytecode generally with much lower performance some interpreters even interpret source code without step first compiling bytecode with even worse performance statically compiled code native code compiled prior deployment dynamic compilation environment one which compiler can be used during execution for instance most common lisp systems have compile function which can compile new functions created during run this provides many advantages jit but programmer rather than runtime control what parts code are compiled this can also compile dynamically generated code which can many scenarios provide substantial performance advantages over statically compiled code well over most jit systems common goal using jit techniques reach surpass performance static compilation while maintaining advantages bytecode interpretation much heavy lifting parsing original source code performing basic optimization often handled at compile time prior deployment compilation from bytecode machine code much faster than compiling from source deployed bytecode portable unlike native code since runtime has control over compilation like interpreted bytecode can run secure sandbox compilers from bytecode machine code are easier write because portable bytecode compiler has already done much work jit code generally offers far better performance than interpreters addition can some cases offer better performance than static compilation many optimizations are only feasible at run-time compilation can be optimized targeted cpu operating system model where application runs for example jit can choose sse2 vector cpu instructions when detects that cpu supports them however there currently no mainstream jit that implements this obtain this level optimization specificity with static compiler one must either compile binary for each intended platform/architecture else include multiple versions portions code within single binary system able collect statistics about how program actually running environment can rearrange recompile for optimum performance however some static compilers can also take profile information input system can do global code optimizations eg inlining library functions without losing advantages dynamic linking without overheads inherent static compilers linkers specifically when doing global inline substitutions static compilation process may need run-time checks ensure that virtual call would occur if actual class object overrides inlined method boundary condition checks on array accesses may need be processed within loops with just-in-time compilation many cases this processing can be moved out loops often giving large increases speed although this possible with statically compiled garbage collected languages bytecode system can more easily rearrange executed code for better cache utilization startup delay optimizations jit causes slight delay noticeable delay initial execution application due time taken load compile bytecode sometimes this delay called startup time delay general more optimization jit performs better code will generate but initial delay will also increase jit compiler therefore has make trade-off between compilation time quality code hopes generate however seems that much startup time sometimes due io-bound operations rather than jit compilation for example rtjar class data file for java virtual machine jvm mb jvm must seek lot data this contextually huge file one possible optimization used by sun's hotspot java virtual machine combine interpretation jit compilation application code initially interpreted but jvm monitors which sequences bytecode are frequently executed translates them machine code for direct execution on hardware for bytecode which executed only few times this saves compilation time reduces initial latency for frequently executed bytecode jit compilation used run at high speed after initial phase slow interpretation additionally since program spends most time executing minority its code reduced compilation time significant finally during initial code interpretation execution statistics can be collected before compilation which helps perform better optimization correct tradeoff can vary due circumstances for example sun's java virtual machine has two major modes—client server client mode minimal compilation optimization performed reduce startup time server mode extensive compilation optimization performed maximize performance once application running by sacrificing startup time other java just-in-time compilers have used runtime measurement number times method has executed combined with bytecode size method heuristic decide when compile still another uses number times executed combined with detection loops general much harder accurately predict which methods optimize short-running applications than long-running ones native image generator ngen by microsoft another approach at reducing initial delay ngen pre-compiles pre-jits bytecode common intermediate language image into machine native code result no runtime compilation needed net framework shipped with visual studio runs ngen on all microsoft library dlls right after installation pre-jitting provides way improve startup time however quality code generates might not be good one that jited for same reasons why code compiled statically without profile-guided optimization cannot be good jit compiled code extreme case lack profiling data drive for instance inline caching there also exist java implementations that combine aot ahead-of-time compiler with either jit compiler excelsior jet interpreter gnu compiler for java history earliest published jit compiler generally attributed work on lisp by john mccarthy his seminal paper recursive functions symbolic expressions their computation by machine part i he mentions functions that are translated during runtime thereby sparing need save compiler output punch cards although this would be more accurately known compile go system another early example was by ken thompson who gave one first applications regular expressions here for pattern matching text editor qed for speed thompson implemented regular expression matching by jiting ibm code on compatible time-sharing system influential technique for deriving compiled code from interpretation was pioneered by mitchell which he implemented for experimental language lc² smalltalk c pioneered new aspects jit compilations for example translation machine code was done on demand result was cached for later use when memory became scarce system would delete some this code regenerate when was needed again sun's self language improved these techniques extensively was at one point fastest smalltalk system world achieving up half speed optimized c but with fully object-oriented language self was abandoned by sun but research went into java language term just-in-time compilation was borrowed from manufacturing term just time popularized by java with james gosling using term from currently jiting used by most implementations java virtual machine hotspot builds on extensively uses this research base hp project dynamo was experimental jit compiler where 'bytecode' format machine code format were same system turned pa-6000 machine code into pa-8000 machine code counterintuitively this resulted speed ups some cases 30% since doing this permitted optimizations at machine code level for example inlining code for better cache usage optimizations calls dynamic libraries many other run-time optimizations which conventional compilers are not able attempt security jit compilation fundamentally uses executable data thus poses security challenges possible exploits implementation jit compilation consists compiling source code byte code machine code executing this generally done directly memory – jit compiler outputs machine code directly into memory immediately executes rather than outputting disk then invoking code separate program usual ahead time compilation modern architectures this runs into problem due executable space protection – arbitrary memory cannot be executed otherwise there potential security hole thus memory must be marked executable for security reasons this should be done after code has been written memory marked read-only writable/executable memory security hole see w^x for instance firefox's jit compiler for javascript introduced this protection release version with firefox jit spraying class computer security exploits that use jit compilation for heap spraying – resulting memory then executable which allows exploit if execution can be moved into heap see also java portal binary translation hotspot common language runtime crusoe microprocessor that essentially performs just-in-time compilation from
