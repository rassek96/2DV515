syntax highlighting from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search for syntax highlighting source wikipedia other wikis using mediawiki see wikipediatext editor support syntax highlight extension html syntax highlighting syntax highlighting feature text editors that are used for programming scripting markup languages such html feature displays text especially source code different colors fonts according category terms this feature facilitates writing structured language such programming language markup language both structures syntax errors are visually distinct highlighting does not affect meaning text itself intended only for human readers syntax highlighting form secondary notation since highlights are not part text meaning but serve reinforce some editors also integrate syntax highlighting with other features such spell checking code folding aids editing which are external language contents practical benefits support text editors syntax elements o examples history limitations see also references practical benefits highlighting effect missing delimiter after watch='false javascript syntax highlighting one strategy improve readability context text especially for code that spans several pages reader can easily ignore large sections comments code depending on what they are looking for syntax highlighting also helps programmers find errors their program for example most editors highlight string literals different color consequently spotting missing delimiter much easier because contrasting color text brace matching another important feature with many popular editors this makes simple see if brace has been left out locate match brace cursor on by highlighting pair different color study published conference ppig evaluated effects syntax highlighting on comprehension short programs finding that presence syntax highlighting significantly reduces time taken for programmer internalise semantics program additionally data gathered from eye-tracker during study suggested that syntax highlighting enables programmers pay less attention standard syntactic components such keywords support text editors some text editors can also export color markup format that suitable for printing for importing into word-processing other kinds text-formatting software for instance html colorized latex postscript rtf version its syntax highlighting there are several syntax highlighting libraries engines that can be used other applications but are not complete programs themselves eg geshi for php for editors that support more than one language user can usually specify language text such c latex html text editor can automatically recognize based on file extension by scanning contents file this automatic language detection presents potential problems for example user may want edit document containing more than one language for example when editing html file that contains embedded javascript code language that not recognized for example when editing source code for obscure relatively new programming language language that differs from file type for example when editing source code extension-less file editor that uses file extensions detect language these cases not clear what language use document may not be highlighted be highlighted incorrectly syntax elements most editors with syntax highlighting allow different colors text styles be given dozens different lexical sub-elements syntax these include keywords comments control-flow statements variables other elements programmers often heavily customize their settings attempt show much useful information possible without making code difficult read examples below comparison snippet c code standard rendering syntax highlighting / hello world / include include int main { printfhello world\n return } / hello world / include include int main { printfhello world\n return } below another snippet syntax highlighted c++ code // create windowcount window objects const auto windowcount = int{10} auto windows = stdarray maxwindowcount>{} for auto i = int{0} i } c++ example editor has recognized keywords auto const int for comment at beginning also highlighted specific manner distinguish from working code history limitations ideas syntax highlighting overlap significantly with those syntax-directed editors one first such editor for code was wilfred hansen's code editor emily provided advanced language-independent code completion facilities unlike modern editors with syntax highlighting actually made impossible create syntactically incorrect programs ben shneiderman suggested color coding text strings suggest meaning live parsing editor lexx written for vm operating system for computerization oxford english dictionary was one first use color syntax highlighting its live parsing capability allowed user-supplied parsers be added editor for text programs data file etc on microcomputers macpascal october recognized pascal syntax was typed used font changes eg bold for keywords highlight syntax on monochrome compact macintosh automatically indented code match its structure some text editors code formatting tools perform syntax highlighting using pattern matching heuristics eg regular expressions rather than implementing parser for each possible language this can result some text rendering systems' syntax highlighting being somewhat inaccurate some cases can perform slowly some text editors overcome this problem by not always parsing whole file but rather just visible area sometimes scanning backwards text up limited number lines for syncing some modern language-specific ides contrast text editors perform full language parsing which results very accurate understanding code extension syntax highlighting was called semantic highlighting by david nolden for open-source c++ ide kdevelop for example semantic highlighting may give local variables unique distinct colors improve comprehensibility code idea colored local variables got further popularized due blog post by evan brooks after that idea was transferred other popular ides like visual studio xcode others see also programming features comparison text editors
