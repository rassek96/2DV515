function defined pipeline sequence operations that take parameters from implicit data structure on which all functions operate return function results that shared structure so that will be used by next operator combination compositional semantics with syntax that mirrors such semantics makes concatenative languages highly amenable algebraic manipulation programs although may be difficult write mathematical expressions directly them concatenative languages can be implemented efficient way with stack machine are common strategy program virtual machines much original work on concatenative language theory was carried out by manfred von thun properties properties concatenative languages are result their compositional syntax semantics reduction any expression simplification one function another function never necessary deal with application functions objects any subexpression can be replaced with name that represents same subexpression this referred concatenative community factoring used extensively simplify programs into smaller parts syntax semantics concatenative languages form algebraic structure monoid concatenative languages can be made well-suited implementation inspired by linear logic where no garbage ever generated implementations first concatenative programming language was forth although joy was first language call itself concatenative other concatenative languages are cat enchilada factor onyx postscript rpl staapl trith xy kitten om most existing concatenative languages are stack-based this not requirement other models have been proposed concatenative languages are currently used for embedded desktop web programming target languages for research purposes most concatenative languages are dynamically typed one exception statically typed cat language see also function-level programming stack-oriented programming language tacit programming homoiconicity references christopher diggins what concatenative language drdobbscom retrieved name code not values concatenativeorg retrieved september concatenative language concatenativeorg retrieved september rationale for joy functional language archived from original on b why concatenative programming matters retrieved september von thun manfred joy compared with other functional languages archived from original on von thun manfred mathematical foundations joy archived from original on henry baker linear logic permutation stacks — forth shall be first homepipelinecom retrieved concatenative language xy nslcom retrieved enchilada programming language enchiladacodenl retrieved om programming language om-languageorg retrieved cat specification cat-languagecom archived from original on retrieved external links concatenativeorg wiki about concatenative languages staapl forth on scheme for embedded controllers enchilada programming language concatenative language xy om programming language v t e types programming languages actor-based array aspect-oriented class-based concatenative concurrent data-structured dataflow declarative domain-specific dynamic esoteric event-driven extensible functional imperative logic macro metaprogramming+multi-paradigm object-based object-oriented pipeline procedural prototype-based reflective rule-based scripting synchronous templating assembly compiled interpreted machine low-level high-level very high-level first generation second generation third generation fourth generation fifth generation non-english-based visual retrieved from https//enwikipediaorg/w/indexphptitle=concatenativeprogramminglanguage&oldid=730548850 categories concatenative programming languages hidden categories all articles with unsourced statements articles with unsourced statements from august navigation menu personal tools not logged talk contributions create account log namespaces article talk variants views read edit view history more search navigation main page contents featured content current events random article donate wikipedia wikipedia store interaction help about wikipedia community portal recent changes contact page tools what links here related changes upload file special pages permanent link page information wikidata item cite this page print/export create book download pdf printable version languages português русский српски / srpski edit links this page was last modified on july at text available under creative commons attribution-sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree terms use privacy policy wikipedia® registered trademark wikimedia foundation inc non-profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
