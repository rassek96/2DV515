top500 from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search distribution supercomputers top500 list by country top500 project ranks details most powerful non-distributed computer systems world project was started publishes updated list supercomputers twice year first these updates always coincides with international supercomputing conference june second presented november at acm/ieee supercomputing conference project aims provide reliable basis for tracking detecting trends high-performance computing bases rankings on hpl portable implementation high-performance linpack benchmark written fortran for distributed-memory computers currently china made sunway taihulight people's republic china prc world's most powerful fastest supercomputer reaching petaflops on linpack benchmarks top500 list compiled by jack dongarra university tennessee knoxville erich strohmaier horst simon nersc/lawrence berkeley national laboratory from until his death hans meuer university mannheim

gflops combined performance largest supercomputers fastest supercomputer supercomputer 500th place early 1990s new definition supercomputer was needed produce meaningful statistics after experimenting with metrics based on processor count idea was born at university mannheim use detailed listing installed systems basis early jack dongarra was persuaded join project with his linpack benchmark first test version was produced may partially based on data available on internet including following sources list world's most powerful computing sites maintained by gunter ahrendt david kahaner director asian technology information program atip published report titled kahaner report on supercomputer japan which had immense amount data information from those sources was used for first two lists since june top500 produced bi-annually based on site vendor submissions only since performance ranked position has steadily grown agreement with moore's law doubling roughly every months tianhe-2 that was fastest november with rpeak pflops over times faster than fastest system november connection machine cm-5/1024 cores with rpeak gflops architecture operating systems june chinese computer made top based on sw26010 processors new radically modified model sunway shenwei line november top500 supercomputers are now all 64-bit mostly based on x86-64 cpus intel emt64 amd amd64 instruction set architecture with few exceptions all risc-based including supercomputers based on power architecture used by ibm power microprocessors seven sparc all fujitsu/sparc-based one which surprisingly made top without gpu currently ranked seventh two seemingly related chinese designs shenwei-based ranked ranked 158th november sunway sw26010-based ranked making up remainder another non-us design pezy-sc while it's accelerator paired with intel's xeon prior ascendance 32-bit x86 later 64-bit x86-64 early 2000s variety risc processor families made up majority top500 supercomputers including risc architectures such sparc mips pa-risc alpha recent years heterogeneous computing mostly using nvidia's graphics processing units gpu coprocessors has become popular way reach better performance per watt ratio higher absolute performance almost required for good performance make top top with some exceptions such mentioned sparc computer without any coprocessors x86-based coprocessor xeon phi has also been used share processor architecture families top500 supercomputers by time trend all fastest supercomputers decade since earth simulator supercomputer have used linux-based operating system november 996% world's fastest supercomputers use linux kernel remaining two 04% run aix operating system variant unix within those 996% running linux are most powerful supercomputers including all those ranking top ten virtually all fastest computers non-linux computers on list – two aix ones – run on power7 ranked 386th 387th those are made by ibm ibm has higher ranked computers running linux including 4th 6th since november no computer on list runs windows november windows azure cloud computer was no longer on list fastest supercomputers its best rank was leaving shanghai supercomputer

equal performances rmax value for different computers order by rpeak for sites that have same computer order by memory size then alphabetically rmax – highest score measured using linpack benchmark suite this number that used rank computers measured quadrillions floating point operations per second ie petaflops rpeak – this theoretical peak performance system measured pflops name – some supercomputers are unique at least on its location are therefore named by their owner model – computing platform marketed processor cores – number active processor cores actively used running linpack

agencies banned nvidia intel corporation from providing xeon chips china due their use according us researching nuclear weapons – research which us law bans us companies from contributing towards on july president obama signed executive order creating national strategic computing initiative calling for accelerated development exascale petaflop system funding research into post-semiconductor computing june japaneses fujitsu announced at international supercomputing conference that its future exascale supercomputer will feature processors its own design that implement armv8 architecture flagship2020 program by fujitsu for riken plans break exaflops barrier by looks like china france have chance do so that united states content – for moment at least – wait until break through exaflops barrier these processors will also implement extensions armv8 architecture equivalent hpc-ace2 that fujitsu developing with arm holdings large machines not on list some major systems are not listed on list largest example ncsa's blue waters which publicly announced decision not participate list because they do not feel accurately indicate ability for any system be able do useful work other organizations decide not list systems for security and/or commercial competitiveness reasons additional purpose-built machines that are not capable do not run benchmark were not included such riken mdgrape-3 mdgrape-4 computers architectures that drop off list ibm roadrunner no longer on list any other using cell coprocessor powerxcell roadrunner supercomputer but example computer that would easily be included if had not been decommissioned faster than one ranked 500th conversely computers such microsoft azure have dropped off list simply because stated performance numbers are no longer high enough while theoretically computers could have been upgraded get faster not without being reported all itanium based systems including one which reached second rank non-simd-style vector processors nec-based such earth simulator that was fastest have also fallen off list similarly sun starfire computers that occupied many spots have been overtaken see also computer science portal
