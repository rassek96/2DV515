created mechanical department from electrical patent department formed year earlier formal organization western electric research laboratories part engineering department american telephone & telegraph company at&t were consolidated form bell telephone laboratories inc separate entity first president research was frank b jewett who stayed there until ownership bell laboratories was evenly split between at&t western electric company its principal work was plan design support equipment that western electric built for bell system operating companies this included everything from telephones telephone exchange switches transmission equipment bell labs also carried out consulting work for bell telephone company us government work few workers were assigned basic research this attracted much attention especially since they produced several nobel prize winners until 1940s company's principal locations were around bell labs building new york city but many these were moved suburban areas new jersey among later bell laboratories locations new jersey were murray hill holmdel crawford hill deal test site freehold lincroft long branch middletown neptune princeton piscataway
