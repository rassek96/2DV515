jooq sql i/ˈɛs kjuː ˈɛl/ i/ˈsiːkwəl/ structured query language special-purpose domain-specific language used programming designed for managing data held relational database management system rdbms for stream processing relational data stream management system rdsms originally based upon relational algebra tuple relational calculus sql consists data definition language data manipulation language data control language scope sql includes data insert query update delete schema creation modification data access control although sql often described great extent declarative language 4gl also includes procedural elements sql was one first commercial languages for edgar f codd's relational model described his influential paper relational model data for large shared data banks despite not entirely adhering relational model described by codd became most widely used database language sql became standard american national standards institute ansi international organization for standardization iso since then standard has been revised include larger set features despite existence such standards most sql code not completely portable among different database systems without adjustments contents history design syntax o language elements o operators o queries + subqueries + inline view + null three-valued logic 3vl o data manipulation o transaction controls o data definition o data types o data control procedural extensions interoperability standardization alternatives distributed sql processing see also notes references external links history sql was initially developed at ibm by donald d chamberlin raymond f boyce early 1970s this version initially called sequel structured english query language was designed manipulate retrieve data stored ibm's original quasi-relational database management system system r which group at ibm san jose research laboratory had developed during 1970s acronym sequel was later changed sql because sequel was trademark uk-based hawker siddeley aircraft company late 1970s relational software inc now oracle corporation saw potential concepts described by codd chamberlin boyce developed their own sql-based rdbms with aspirations selling us navy central intelligence agency other us government agencies june relational software inc introduced first commercially available implementation sql oracle v2 version2 for vax computers after testing sql at customer test sites determine usefulness practicality system ibm began developing commercial products based on their system r prototype including system/38 sql/ds db2 which were commercially available respectively design sql deviates several ways from its theoretical foundation relational model its tuple calculus that model table set tuples while sql tables query results are lists rows same row may occur multiple times order rows can be employed queries eg limit clause critics argue that sql should be replaced with language that strictly returns original foundation for example see third manifesto syntax has been suggested that this section be split out into another article titled sql syntax discuss june language elements chart showing several sql language elements that compose single statement sql language subdivided into several language elements including clauses which are constituent components statements queries some cases these are optional expressions which can produce either scalar values tables consisting columns rows data predicates which specify conditions that can be evaluated sql three-valued logic 3vl true/false/unknown boolean truth values are used limit effects statements queries change program flow queries which retrieve data based on specific criteria this important element sql statements which may have persistent effect on schemata data may control transactions program flow connections sessions diagnostics o sql statements also include semicolon statement terminator though not required on every platform defined standard part sql grammar insignificant whitespace generally ignored sql statements queries making easier format sql code for readability operators operator description example = equal author = 'alcott' not equal many dbmss accept = addition dept 'sales' > greater than hiredate > '' = greater than equal dependents >= then 'positive' when n order by title example below demonstrates query multiple tables grouping aggregation by returning list books number authors associated with each book select booktitle title count authors from book join bookauthor on bookisbn = bookauthorisbn group by booktitle example output might resemble following title authors ---------------------- ------- sql examples guide joy sql introduction sql pitfalls sql under precondition that isbn only common column name two tables that column named title only exists book table one could re-write query above following form select title count authors from book natural join bookauthor group by title however many vendors either do not support this approach require certain column-naming conventions for natural joins work effectively sql includes operators functions for calculating values on stored values sql allows use expressions select list project data following example which returns list books that cost more than with additional salestax column containing sales tax figure calculated at 6% price select isbn title price price salestax from book where price > order by title subqueries queries can be nested so that results one query can be used another query via relational operator aggregation function nested query also known subquery while joins other table operations provide computationally superior ie faster alternatives many cases use subqueries introduces hierarchy execution that can be useful necessary following example aggregation function avg receives input result subquery select isbn title price from book where price distinct from infixed comparison operator which returns true unless both operands are equal both are null likewise not distinct from defined not distinct from sql1999 also introduced boolean type variables which according standard can also hold unknown values practice number systems eg postgresql implement boolean unknown boolean null data manipulation data manipulation language dml subset sql used add update delete data insert adds rows formally tuples existing table eg insert into example field1 field2 field3 values 'test' 'n' null update modifies set existing table rows eg update example set field1 = 'updated value' where field2 = 'n' delete removes existing rows from table eg delete from example where field2 = 'n' merge used combine data multiple tables combines insert update elements defined sql2003 standard prior that some databases provided similar functionality via different syntax sometimes called upsert merge into tablename using tablereference on condition when matched then update set column1 = value1 when not matched then insert column1 values value1 transaction controls transactions if available wrap dml operations start transaction begin work begin transaction depending on sql dialect marks start database transaction which either completes entirely not at all save transaction savepoint saves state database at current point transaction create table tbl1id int insert into tbl1id values1 insert into tbl1id values2 commit update tbl1 set id=200 where id=1 savepoint id1upd update tbl1 set id=1000 where id=2 rollback id1upd select id from tbl1 commit makes all data changes transaction permanent rollback discards all data changes since last commit rollback leaving data was prior those changes once commit statement completes transaction's changes cannot be rolled back commit rollback terminate current transaction release data locks absence start transaction similar statement semantics sql are implementation-dependent following example shows classic transfer funds transaction where money removed from one account added another if either removal addition fails entire transaction rolled back start transaction update account set amount=amount-200 where accountnumber=1234 update account set amount=amount+200 where accountnumber=2345 if errors=0 commit if errors0 rollback data definition data definition language ddl manages table index structure most basic items ddl are create alter rename drop truncate statements create creates object table for example database eg create table example column1 integer column2 varchar50 column3 date not null primary key column1 column2 alter modifies structure existing object various ways for example adding column existing table constraint eg alter table example add column4 number3 not null truncate deletes all data from table very fast way deleting data inside table not table itself usually implies subsequent commit operation ie cannot be rolled back data not written logs for rollback later unlike delete truncate table example drop deletes object database usually irretrievably ie cannot be rolled back eg drop table example data types each column sql table declares types that column may contain ansi sql includes following data types character strings charactern charn fixed-width n-character string padded with spaces needed character varyingn varcharn variable-width string with maximum size n characters national charactern ncharn fixed width string supporting international character set national character varyingn nvarcharn variable-width nchar string bit strings bitn array n bits bit varyingn array up n bits numbers integer smallint bigint float real double precision numericprecision scale decimalprecision scale for example number has precision scale precision positive integer that determines number significant digits particular radix binary decimal scale non-negative integer scale indicates that number integer for decimal number with scale s exact numeric value integer value significant digits divided by 10s sql provides function round numerics dates called trunc informix db2 postgresql oracle mysql round informix sqlite sybase oracle postgresql microsoft sql server temporal date/time date for date values eg time for time values eg granularity time value usually tick nanoseconds time with time zone timetz same time but including details about time zone question timestamp this date time put together one variable eg timestamp with time zone timestamptz same timestamp but including details about time zone question sql provides several functions for generating date / time variable out date / time string todate totime totimestamp well for extracting respective members seconds for instance such variables current system date / time database server can be called by using functions like now ibm informix implementation provides extend fraction functions increase accuracy time for systems requiring sub-second precision data control data control language dcl authorizes users access

assemblies database while prior versions sql server were restricted unmanaged extended stored procedures primarily written c postgresql lets users write functions wide variety languages—including perl python tcl c interoperability standardization sql implementations are incompatible between vendors do not necessarily completely follow standards particular date time syntax string concatenation nulls comparison case sensitivity vary from vendor vendor particular exception postgresql which strives for standards compliance popular implementations sql commonly omit support for basic features standard sql such date time data types most obvious such examples incidentally most popular commercial proprietary sql dbmss are oracle whose date behaves datetime lacks time type ms sql server before version result sql code can rarely be ported between database systems without modifications there are several reasons for this lack portability between database systems complexity size sql standard means that most implementors do not support entire standard standard does not specify database behavior several important areas eg indexes file storage leaving implementations decide how behave sql standard precisely specifies syntax that conforming database system must implement however standard's specification semantics language constructs less well-defined leading ambiguity many database vendors have large existing customer bases where newer version sql standard conflicts with prior behavior vendor's database vendor may be unwilling break backward compatibility there little commercial incentive for vendors make easier for users change database suppliers see vendor lock-in users evaluating database software tend place other factors such performance higher their priorities than standards
