editions module specification are known levels are denoted by first integer title eg css3 = level subsequent revisions on each level are denoted by integer following decimal point eg css21 = revision w3c standard formation process defined within w3c process document outlining four maturity levels through which each new standard recommendation must progress working draft wd after enough content has been gathered from 'editor drafts' discussion may be published working draft wd for review by community wd document first form standard that publicly available commentary by virtually anyone accepted though no promises are made with regard action on any particular element commented upon at this stage standard document may have significant differences from its final form such anyone who implements wd standards should be ready significantly modify their implementations standard matures candidate recommendation cr candidate recommendation version standard that more mature than wd at this point group responsible for standard satisfied that standard meets its goal purpose cr elicit aid from development community how implementable standard standard document may change further but at this point significant features are mostly decided design those features can still change due feedback from implementors proposed recommendation pr proposed recommendation version standard that has passed prior two levels users standard provide input at this stage document submitted w3c advisory council for final approval while this step important rarely causes any significant changes standard passes next phase both candidates proposals may enter last call signal that any further feedback must be provided w3c recommendation rec this most mature stage development at this point standard has undergone extensive review testing under both theoretical practical conditions standard now endorsed by w3c indicating its readiness for deployment public encouraging more widespread support among implementors authors recommendations can sometimes be implemented incorrectly partially not at all but many standards define two more levels conformance that developers must follow if they wish label their product w3c-compliant later revisions recommendation may be updated extended by separately-published non-technical errata editor drafts until sufficient substantial edits accumulate for producing new edition level recommendation additionally w3c publishes various kinds informative notes which are be used references certification unlike isoc other international standards bodies w3c does not have certification program w3c has decided for now that not suitable start such program owing risk creating more drawbacks for community than benefits administration consortium jointly administered by mit
