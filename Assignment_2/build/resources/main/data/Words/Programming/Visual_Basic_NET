net framework microsoft launched vbnet successor its original visual basic language although net portion name was dropped this article uses visual basic refer all visual basic languages releases since order distinguish between them classic visual basic along with visual c one two main languages targeting net framework microsoft's integrated development environment ide for developing visual basic net language visual studio most visual studio editions are commercial only exceptions are visual studio express visual studio community which are freeware addition net framework sdk includes freeware

most common statement expression statement consisting expression be evaluated on single line part that evaluation functions subroutines may be called variables may be assigned new values modify normal sequential execution statements vbnet provides several control-flow statements identified by reserved keywords structured programming supported by several constructs including two conditional execution constructs if … then … else … end if select case case end select three iterative execution loop constructs do … loop for … for each for … statement has separate initialisation testing sections both which must be present see examples below for each statement steps through each value list addition visual basic net there no unified way defining blocks statements instead certain keywords such if … then sub are interpreted starters sub-blocks code have matching termination keywords such end if end sub statements are terminated either with colon with end line multiple line statements visual basic net are enabled with at end each such line need for underscore continuation character was largely removed version later versions equals sign = used both assigning values variable comparison round brackets parentheses are used with arrays both declare them get value at given index one them visual basic net uses round brackets define parameters subroutines functions single quotation mark ' placed at beginning line after any number space tab characters at beginning line after other code on line indicates that remainder line comment simple example following very simple vbnet program version classic hello world example created console application module module1 sub main ' classic hello world demonstration program consolewritelinehello world end sub end module prints hello world on command-line window each line serves specific purpose follows module module1 this module definition division code similar class although modules can contain classes modules serve containers code that can be referenced from other parts program common practice for module code file which contains have same name however this not required single code file may contain more than one module and/or class definition sub main defines subroutine called main main entry point where program begins execution consolewritelinehello world this line performs actual task writing output console system object representing command-line interface also known console granting programmatic access operating system's standard streams program calls console method writeline which causes string passed be displayed on console instead consolewriteline one could use msgbox which prints message dialog box instead command-line window complex example this piece code solution floyd's triangle imports systemconsole module program sub main dim rows integer 'input validation do until integertryparsereadlineenter value for how many rows be displayed rows andalso rows >= writelineallowed range {0}

which takes prompt string ''' function readlineoptional prompt string = nothing string if prompt isnot nothing then writeprompt end if return consolereadline end function end module comparison with classic visual basic main article comparison visual basic visual basic net whether visual basic net should be considered just another version visual basic completely different language topic debate there are new additions support new features such structured exception handling short-circuited expressions also two important data-type changes occurred with move vbnet compared visual basic integer data type has been doubled length from bits bits long data type has been doubled length from bits bits this true for all versions vbnet 16-bit integer all versions vbnet now known short similarly windows forms editor very similar style function visual basic form editor things that have changed significantly are semantics—from those object-based programming language running on deterministic reference-counted engine based on com fully object-oriented language backed by net framework which consists combination common language runtime virtual machine using generational garbage collection just-in-time compilation engine far larger class library increased breadth latter also problem that vb developers have deal with when coming language although this somewhat addressed by my feature visual studio changes have altered many underlying assumptions about right thing do with respect performance maintainability some functions libraries no longer exist others are available but not efficient native net alternatives even if they compile most converted visual basic applications will require some level refactoring take full advantage new language documentation available cover changes syntax debugging applications deployment terminology comparative examples following simple examples compare vb vbnet syntax they assume that developer has created form placed button on has associated subroutines demonstrated each example with click event handler mentioned button each example creates hello world message box after button on form clicked visual basic private sub command1click msgbox hello world end sub vbnet msgbox messagebox class can be used private sub button1clicksender object e eventargs handles button1click msgboxhello world end sub both visual basic visual basic net automatically generate sub end sub statements when corresponding button double-clicked design view visual basic net will also generate necessary class end class statements developer need only add statement display hello world message box all procedure calls must be made with parentheses vbnet whereas visual basic there were different conventions for functions parentheses required subs no parentheses allowed unless called using keyword call names command1 button1 are not obligatory however these are default names for command button visual basic vbnet respectively vbnet handles keyword used make sub button1click handler for click event object button1 visual basic event handler subs must have specific name consisting object's name command1 underscore event's name click hence command1click there function called messageboxshow microsoftvisualbasic namespace which can be used instead msgbox similarly corresponding function visual basic there controversy about which function use best practice not only restricted showing message boxes but also regarding other features microsoftvisualbasic namespace some programmers prefer do things net way since framework classes have more features are less language-specific others argue that using language-specific features makes code more readable for example using int c integer vbnet instead systemint32 visual basic inclusion byval sender object byval e eventargs has become optional following example demonstrates difference between visual basic vbnet both examples close active window visual basic sub cmdcloseclick unload me end sub vbnet sub btncloseclicksender object e eventargs handles btncloseclick close end sub 'cmd' prefix replaced by 'btn' prefix conforming new convention previously mentioned visual basic did not provide common operator shortcuts following are equivalent visual basic sub timer1timer 'reduces form height by one pixel per tick meheight = meheight - end sub vbnet sub timer1ticksender object e eventargs handles timer1tick meheight -= end sub comparison with c main article comparison c sharp visual basic net c visual basic net are microsoft's first languages made program on net framework later adding f more others have also added languages though c vbnet are syntactically different that where differences mostly end microsoft developed both these languages be part same net framework development platform they are both developed managed supported by same language development team at microsoft they compile same intermediate language il which runs against same net framework runtime libraries although there are some differences programming constructs their differences are primarily syntactic assuming one avoids visual basic compatibility libraries provided by microsoft aid conversion from visual basic almost every command vb has equivalent command c vice versa lastly both languages reference same base classes net framework extend their functionality result with few exceptions program written either language can be run through simple syntax converter translate other there are many open source commercially available products for this task examples hello world windows form application public class form1 private sub button1clicksender object e eventargs handles button1click msgboxhello world msgboxstyleinformation hello world ' show message that says hello

classic visual basic version first version visual basic net debuted seven versions visual basic net are released vb first version visual basic net relies on net framework most important feature managed code which contrasts with classic visual basic vb visual basic net was released with net framework new features included support for net compact framework better vb upgrade wizard improvements were also made performance reliability net ide particularly background compiler runtime addition visual basic net was available visual studionet academic edition distributed certain number scholars from each country without cost vb after visual basic net microsoft dropped net from name product calling next version visual basic for this release microsoft added many features intended reinforce visual basic net's focus rapid application development platform further differentiate from c including edit continue feature design-time expression evaluation pseudo-namespace called my which provides o easy access certain areas net framework that otherwise require significant code access like using myform2text = mainform rather than systemwindowsapplication1formsform2text = mainform o dynamically generated classes eg myforms improved vb-to-vbnet converter using keyword simplifying use objects that require dispose pattern free resources just my code feature which hides steps over boilerplate code written by visual studio net ide system library code during debugging data source binding easing database client/server development bridge gaps between itself other net languages this version added generics partial classes method defining some parts class one file then adding more definitions later particularly useful for integrating user code with auto-generated code operator overloading nullable types support for unsigned integer data types commonly used other languages visual basic introduced isnot operator that makes 'if x isnot y' equivalent 'if not x y' gained notoriety when was found be subject microsoft patent application vb visual basic was released along with net framework on november for this release microsoft added many features including true conditional operator ifcondition boolean truepart falsepart replace iif function anonymous types support for linq lambda expressions xml literals type inference extension methods vb april microsoft released visual basic microsoft had planned use dynamic language runtime dlr for that release but shifted co-evolution strategy between visual basic sister language c bring both languages into closer parity with one another visual basic's innate ability interact dynamically with clr com objects has been enhanced work with dynamic languages built on dlr such ironpython ironruby visual basic compiler was improved infer line continuation set common contexts many cases removing need for line continuation character also existing support inline functions was complemented with support for inline subs well multi-line versions both sub function lambdas vb visual basic was released along net framework major features introduced this version include asynchronous programming with async await statements iterators call hierarchy caller information global keyword namespace statements vb visual basic code named vb has been released with visual studio language features include new operator perform inline null checks new string interpolation feature included format strings inline cross-platform open-source development creation open-source tools for vbnet development has been slow compared c although mono development platform provides implementation vbnet-specific libraries vbnet compatible compiler written vbnet well standard framework libraries such windows forms gui library sharpdevelop
