namely abū jaʿfar muḥammad ibn mūsā ibn shākir before – february abū al‐qāsim aḥmad ibn mūsā ibn shākir d 9th century al-ḥasan ibn mūsā ibn shākir d 9th century were three 9th-century scholars who lived worked baghdad they are known for their book ingenious devices on automata automatic machines mechanical devices another important work theirs book on measurement plane spherical figures foundational work on geometry that was frequently quoted by both islamic european mathematicians banu musa worked astronomical observatories established baghdad by abbasid caliph al-ma'mun well doing research house wisdom they also participated 9th-century expedition make geodesic measurements determine length degree contents life mathematics mechanics astronomy politics works o automata o astronomy o astrology o mathematics see also references further reading external links life banu musa were three sons mūsā ibn shākir who earlier life had been highwayman astronomer khorasan unknown pedigree after befriending al-ma'mun who was then governor khorasan staying marw musa was employed astrologer astronomer after his death his young sons were looked after by court al-maʾmūn al-maʾmūn recognized abilities three brothers enrolled them famous house wisdom library translation center baghdad studying house wisdom under yahya ibn abi mansur they participated efforts translate ancient greek works into arabic by sending for greek texts from byzantines paying large sums for their translation learning greek themselves on such trips muhammad met recruited famous mathematician translator thābit ibn qurra at some point hunayn ibn ishaq was also part their team brothers sponsored many scientists translators who were paid about dīnārs month if wasn't for brothers' efforts many greek texts that they translated would have been lost forgotten after death al-ma'mun banu musa continued work under caliphs al-mu'tasim al-wathiq al-mutawakkil however during reign al-wathiq al-mutawakkil internal rivalries arose between scholars house wisdom at some point banu musa became enemies al-kindi contributed his persecution by al-mutawakkil they were later employed by al-mutawakkil construct canal for new city al-jafariyya mathematics mechanics banu musa had different view on area circumference than greeks research they translated greeks looked at volume area more terms ratios rather than giving them actual numerical value most them based such measurements relatively on another object's size one their surviving publications kitab marifat masakhat al-ashkal book measurement plane spherical figures banu musa gave volume area number values this evidence that they were not just translating reproducing greek sources they were actually building on concepts coming up with some their own original works most popular their publications was kitāb al-ḥiyal tricks book which was mostly work aḥmad middle brother was book filled with one hundred mechanical devices there were some real practical inventions book including lamp that would mechanically dim alternating fountains clamshell grab eighty these devices were described trick vessels that showed real mastery mechanics with real focus on use light pressure some devices seem be replications earlier greek works but rest were much more advanced than what greeks had done astronomy they made many observations contributions field astronomy writing nearly dozen publications over their astronomical research they made many observations on sun moon al-ma’mun had them go desert mesopotamia measure length degree they also measured length year be days hours politics although they were not made famous by their politics should be noted that they did have interests outside world science mainly oldest brother muhammad they were employed by caliphs for many different projects including canal mentioned above they were also part team hired build town al-d̲j̲aʿfariyya for al-mutawakkil taking on these types civil projects naturally got them involved political scene baghdad however height muhammad's political activity palace came towards end his life during time when turkish commanders were starting take control state after al-mutawakkil died muhammad helped al-mustaʿīn get nomination instead caliph's brother when caliph's brother besieged city baghdad muhammad was sent estimate size army when siege was over he was sent get terms how al-mustaʿīn would renounce throne this evidence shows where muhammad ranks at that time he was trusted respected by highest levels authority at that time works banu musa wrote almost books majority which are now lost automata most notable among their achievements their work field automation which they utilized toys other entertaining creations they have shown important advances over those their greek predecessors book ingenious devices describes inventions ones which have been reconstructed work designed while designed primarily for amusement purposes they employ innovative engineering technologies such one-way two-way valves able open close by themselves mechanical memories devices respond feedback delays most these devices were operated by water pressure qarasṭūn treatise on weight balance on mechanical devices work on pneumatic devices written by ahmad book on description instrument which sounds by itself about musical
