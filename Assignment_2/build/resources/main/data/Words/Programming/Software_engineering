links history main article history software engineering when first digital computers appeared early 1940s instructions make them operate were wired into machine practitioners quickly realized that this design was not flexible came up with stored program architecture von neumann architecture thus division between hardware software began with abstraction being used deal with complexity computing programming languages started appear 1950s this was also another major step abstraction major languages such fortran algol cobol were released late 1950s deal with scientific algorithmic business problems respectively edsger w dijkstra wrote his seminal paper go statement considered harmful david parnas introduced key concept modularity information hiding help programmers deal with ever increasing complexity software systems origins term software engineering have been attributed different sources but was used title for world's first conference on software engineering sponsored facilitated by nato conference was attended by international experts on software who agreed on defining best practices for software grounded application engineering result conference report that defines how software should be developed original report publicly available discipline software engineering was created address poor quality software get projects exceeding time budget under control ensure that software built systematically rigorously measurably on time on budget within specification engineering already addresses all these issues hence same principles used engineering can be applied software widespread lack best practices for software at time was perceived software crisis barry w boehm documented several key advances field his book 'software engineering economics' these include his constructive cost model cocomo which relates software development effort for program man-years t source lines code sloc t = k ∗ s l o c + x {\displaystyle t=ksloc^{1+x}} book analyzes sixty-three software projects concludes cost fixing errors escalates project moves toward field use book also asserts that key driver software cost capability software development team software engineering institute sei was established federally funded research development center headquartered on campus carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pennsylvania united states watts humphrey founded sei software process program aimed at understanding managing software engineering process his book managing software process asserts that software development process can should be controlled measured improved process maturity levels introduced would become capability maturity model integration for developmentcmmi-dev which has defined how us government evaluates abilities software development team modern generally accepted best-practices for software engineering have been collected by iso/iec jtc 1/sc subcommittee published software engineering body knowledge swebok subdisciplines software

that activity systematic repeatable ultimately more success-oriented software quality software engineering professional practice concerned with knowledge skills attitudes that software engineers must possess practice software engineering professional responsible ethical manner software engineering economics about making decisions related software engineering business context computing foundations mathematical foundations engineering foundations education knowledge computer programming prerequisite for becoming software engineer ieee computer society produced swebok which has been published iso/iec technical report describing body knowledge that they recommend be mastered by graduate software engineer with four years experience many software engineers enter profession by obtaining university degree training at vocational school one standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees was defined by ccse updated number universities have software engineering degree programs there were campus bachelor software engineering programs online programs masters-level programs doctorate-level programs certificate-level programs united states for practitioners who wish become proficient recognized professional software engineers ieee offers two certifications that extend knowledge above level achieved by academic degree certified software development associate certified software development professional addition university education many companies sponsor internships for students wishing pursue careers information technology these internships can introduce student interesting real-world tasks that typical software engineers encounter every day similar experience can be gained through military service software engineering profession main article software engineer legal requirements for licensing certification professional software engineers vary around world uk british computer society licenses software engineers members society can also become chartered engineers ceng while some areas canada such alberta british columbia ontario quebec software engineers can hold professional engineer peng designation and/or information systems professional isp designation canada there legal requirement have peng when one wants use title engineer practice software engineering europe software engineers can obtain european engineer eur ing professional title united states starting from offers ncees professional engineer exam for software engineering thereby allowing software engineers be licensed recognized mandatory licensing currently still largely debated perceived controversial some parts us such texas use term engineer regulated by law reserved only for use by individuals who have professional engineer license ieee informs professional engineer license not required unless individual would work for public where health others could be at risk if engineer was not fully qualified required standards by particular state professional engineer licenses are specific state that has awarded them have be regularly retaken ieee computer society acm two main us-based professional organizations software engineering publish guides profession software engineering ieee's guide software engineering body knowledge - version swebok defines field describes knowledge ieee expects practicing software engineer have most current swebok v3 updated version was released ieee also promulgates software engineering code ethics employment u s bureau labor statistics counted software engineers holding jobs us same time period there were some million practitioners employed us all other engineering disciplines combined due its relative newness field study formal education software engineering often taught part computer science curriculum many software engineers hold computer science degrees have no engineering background whatsoever many software engineers work employees contractors software engineers work with businesses government agencies civilian military non-profit organizations some software engineers work for themselves freelancers some organizations have specialists perform each tasks software development process other organizations require software engineers do many all them large projects people may specialize only one role small projects people may fill several all roles at same time specializations include industry analysts architects developers testers technical support middleware analysts managers academia educators researchers most software engineers programmers work hours week but about percent software engineers percent programmers worked more than hours week injuries these occupations are rare however like other workers who spend long periods front computer terminal typing at keyboard engineers programmers are susceptible eyestrain back discomfort hand wrist problems such carpal tunnel syndrome field's future looks bright according money magazine salarycom which rated software engineer best job united states software engineering was again ranked best job united states this time by careercastcom certification software engineering institute offers certifications on specific topics like security process improvement software architecture apple ibm microsoft other companies also sponsor their own certification examinations many certification programs are oriented toward specific technologies managed by vendors these technologies these certification programs are tailored institutions that would employ people who use these technologies broader certification general software engineering skills available through various professional societies ieee had certified over software professionals certified software development professional csdp they added entry-level certification known certified software development associate csda acm had professional certification program early 1980s which was discontinued due lack interest acm examined possibility professional certification software engineers late 1990s but eventually decided that such certification was inappropriate for professional industrial practice software engineering uk british computer society has developed legally recognized professional certification called chartered professional citp available fully qualified members mbcs software engineers may be eligible for membership institution engineering technology so qualify for chartered engineer status canada canadian information processing society has developed legally recognized professional certification called information systems professional isp ontario canada software engineers who graduate from canadian engineering accreditation board ceab accredited program successfully complete peo's professional engineers ontario professional practice examination ppe have at least months acceptable engineering experience are eligible be licensed through professional engineers ontario can become professional engineers peng peo does not recognize any online distance education however does not consider computer science programs be equivalent software engineering programs despite tremendous overlap between two this has sparked controversy certification war has also held number peng holders for profession exceptionally low vast majority working professionals field hold degree cs not se given difficult certification path for holders non-se degrees most never bother pursue license impact globalization initial impact outsourcing relatively lower cost international human resources developing third world countries led massive migration software development activities from corporations north america europe india later china russia other developing countries this approach had some flaws mainly distance / timezone difference that prevented human interaction between clients developers massive job transfer this had negative impact on many aspects software engineering profession for example some students developed world avoid education related software engineering because fear offshore outsourcing importing software products services from other countries being displaced by foreign visa workers although statistics do not currently show threat software engineering itself related career computer programming does appear have been affected nevertheless ability smartly leverage offshore near-shore resources via follow-the-sun workflow has improved overall operational capability many organizations when north americans are leaving work asians are just arriving work when asians are leaving work europeans are arriving work this provides continuous ability have human oversight on business-critical processes hours per day without paying overtime compensation disrupting key human resource sleep patterns while global outsourcing has several advantages global - generally distributed - development can run into serious difficulties resulting from distance between developers this due key elements this type distance that have been identified geographical temporal cultural communication that includes use different languages dialects english different locations research has been carried out area global software development over last years extensive body relevant work published that highlights benefits problems associated with complex activity with other aspects software engineering research ongoing this related areas related fields software engineering direct sub-field engineering has overlap with computer science management science also considered part overall systems engineering controversy over definition typical formal definitions software engineering are application systematic disciplined quantifiable approach development operation maintenance software engineering discipline that concerned with all aspects software production establishment use sound engineering principles order economically obtain software that reliable works efficiently on real machines term has been used less formally informal contemporary term for broad range activities that were formerly called computer programming systems analysis broad term for all aspects practice computer programming opposed theory computer programming which called computer science term embodying advocacy specific approach computer programming one that urges that be treated engineering discipline rather than art craft advocates codification recommended practices criticism software engineering sees its practitioners individuals who follow well-defined engineering approaches problem-solving these approaches are specified various software engineering books research papers always with connotations predictability precision mitigated risk professionalism this perspective has led calls for licensing certification codified bodies knowledge mechanisms for spreading engineering knowledge maturing field software craftsmanship has been proposed by body software developers alternative that emphasizes coding skills accountability software developers themselves without professionalism any prescribed curriculum leading ad-hoc problem-solving craftmanship without engineering lack predictability precision missing risk mitigation methods are informal poorly defined software craftsmanship manifesto extends agile software manifesto draws metaphor between modern software development apprenticeship model medieval europe software engineering extends engineering draws on engineering model ie engineering process engineering project management engineering requirements engineering design engineering construction engineering validation concept so new that rarely understood widely misinterpreted including software engineering textbooks papers among communities programmers crafters one core issues software engineering that its approaches are not empirical enough because real-world validation approaches usually absent very limited hence software engineering often misinterpreted feasible only theoretical environment dijkstra who developed computer languages last century refuted concepts software engineering that was prevalent thirty years ago 1980s arguing that those terms were poor analogies for what he called radical novelty computer science number these phenomena have been bundled under name software engineering economics known miserable science software engineering should be known doomed discipline doomed because cannot even approach its goal since its goal self-contradictory software engineering course presents itself
