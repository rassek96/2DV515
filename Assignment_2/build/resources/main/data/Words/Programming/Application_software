software refers all applications collectively this contrasts with system software which mainly involved with running computer applications may be bundled with computer its system software published separately may be coded proprietary open-source university projects apps built for mobile platforms are called mobile apps contents terminology o metonymy o apps killer apps classification o information worker software o entertainment software o educational software o enterprise infrastructure software o simulation software o media development software o product engineering software see also references external links terminology information technology application computer program designed help people perform activity application thus differs from operating system which runs computer utility which performs maintenance general-purpose chores programming tool with which computer programs are created depending on activity for which was designed application can manipulate text numbers graphics combination these elements some application packages focus on single task such word processing others called integrated software include several applications user-written software tailors systems meet user's specific needs user-written software includes spreadsheet templates word processor macros scientific simulations graphics animation scripts even email filters are kind user software users create this software themselves often overlook how important delineation between system software such operating systems application software not exact however occasionally object controversy for example one key questions united states v microsoft antitrust trial was whether microsoft's internet explorer web browser was part its windows operating system separable piece application software another example gnu/linux naming controversy part due disagreement about relationship between linux kernel operating systems built over this kernel some types embedded systems application software operating system software may be indistinguishable user case software used control vcr dvd player microwave oven above definitions may exclude some applications that may exist on some computers large organizations for alternative definition app see application portfolio management metonymy word application once used adjective not restricted pertaining application software meaning for example concepts such application programming interface api application server application virtualization application lifecycle management portable application apply all computer programs alike not just application software apps killer apps some applications are available versions for several different platforms others have narrower requirements are thus called for example geography application for windows android application for education linux gaming sometimes new popular application arises which only runs on one platform increasing desirability that platform this called killer application killer app recent years shortened term app coined earlier has become popular refer applications for mobile devices such smartphones tablets shortened form matching their typically smaller scope compared applications on pcs classification there are many different ways divide up different types application software several are explained here since development near-universal adoption web important distinction that has emerged has been between web applications — written with html javascript other web-native technologies typically requiring one be online running web browser more traditional native applications written whatever languages are available for one's particular type computer there has been contentious debate computing community regarding web applications replacing native applications for many purposes especially on mobile devices such smart phones tablets web apps have indeed greatly increased popularity for some uses but advantages applications make them unlikely disappear soon if ever furthermore two can be complementary even integrated application software can also be seen being either horizontal vertical horizontal applications are more popular widespread because they are general purpose for example word processors databases vertical applications are niche products designed for particular type industry business department within organization integrated suites software will try handle every specific aspect possible for example manufacturing banking systems accounting customer service there are many types application software application suite consists multiple applications bundled together they usually have related functions features user interfaces may be able interact with each other eg open each other's files business applications often come suites eg microsoft office libreoffice iwork which bundle together word processor spreadsheet etc but suites exist for other purposes eg graphics music enterprise software addresses needs entire organization's processes data flows across several departments often large distributed environment examples include enterprise resource planning systems customer relationship management crm systems supply chain management software departmental software sub-type enterprise software with focus on smaller organizations and/or groups within large organization examples include travel expense management helpdesk enterprise infrastructure software provides common capabilities needed support enterprise software systems examples include databases email servers systems for managing networks security information worker software lets users create manage information often for individual projects within department contrast enterprise management examples include time management resource management analytical collaborative documentation tools word processors spreadsheets email blog clients personal information system individual media editors may aid multiple information worker tasks content access software used primarily access content without editing but may include software that allows for content editing such software addresses needs individuals groups consume digital entertainment published digital content examples include media players web browsers help browsers educational software related content access software but has content and/or features adapted for use by educators students for example may deliver evaluations tests track progress through material include collaborative capabilities simulation software simulates physical abstract systems for either research training entertainment purposes media development software generates print electronic media for others consume most often commercial educational setting this includes graphic-art software desktop publishing software multimedia development software html editors digital-animation editors digital audio video composition many others product engineering software used developing hardware software products this includes computer-aided design cad computer-aided engineering cae computer language editing compiling tools integrated development environments application programmer interfaces entertainment software can refer video games screen savers programs display motion pictures play recorded music other forms entertainment which can be experienced through use computing device applications can also be classified by computing platform such particular operating system delivery network such cloud computing web applications delivery devices such mobile apps for mobile devices
