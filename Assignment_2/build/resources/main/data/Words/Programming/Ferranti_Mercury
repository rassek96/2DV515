ferranti mercury from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search mercury was early commercial computer from mid 1950s built by ferranti was successor ferranti mark adding floating point unit for improved performance increased reliability by replacing williams tube memory with core memory using more solid state components computer had roughly vacuum tubes mostly type cv2179/a2134 pentodes el81 pentodes cv2493/ecc88 double triodes germanium diodes nineteen mercuries were sold before ferranti moved on newer designs contents predecessor mark i prototype meg commercial version mercury see also references external links predecessor mark i main article manchester mark when mark i started running reliability was poor primary concern was drum memory system which broke down all time additionally machine used thermionic valves mostly ef50 pentodes diodes that had be replaced constantly williams tubes used random access memory registers were reliable but required constant maintenance soon system went into operation teams started looking at solutions these problems one team decided produce much smaller more cost-effective system built entirely with transistors first ran november believed be first entirely transistor-based computer metropolitan-vickers later built this commercially metrovick delivering seven prototype meg another team including main designers mark i started with design very similar mark i but replacing valves used diodes with solid state diodes at that time computers were used almost always sciences they decided add floating-point unit greatly improve performance this role additionally machine was run at mhz eight times faster than mark i's khz leading use name megacycle machine eventually meg meg first ran may use solid-state diodes reduced valve count by well over half reducing power requirement from mark i's kw meg's kw like mark i meg was based on 10-bit short word combining two form 20-bit address four make 40-bit integer this was result physical properties williams tubes which were used make eight b-lines modern terminology accumulator/index registers meg could multiply two integers about microseconds floating-point unit used three words for 30-bit mantissa another 10-bit exponent could add two floating-point numbers about microseconds multiply them about µs commercial version mercury ferranti which had built mark i for university continued development prototype meg produce mercury main change was replace williams tubes with core memory although slower access at about µs for 10-bit short word system required virtually no maintenance considerably more important for commercial users 1024×40-bits core were provided backed by four drums each holding 4096×40-bits much detailed information both about
