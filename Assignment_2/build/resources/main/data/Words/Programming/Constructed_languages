constructed language from wikipedia free encyclopedia   redirected from constructed languages jump navigation search this article about creation planned artificial human languages for information about linguistic field language planning policy see language planning conlang flag symbol language construction created by subscribers conlang mailing list which represents tower babel against rising sun planned constructed language sometimes called conlang language whose phonology grammar vocabulary have been consciously devised for human human-like communication instead having developed naturally also referred artificial invented language there are many possible reasons create constructed language such ease human communication see international auxiliary language code give fiction associated constructed setting added layer realism for experimentation fields linguistics cognitive science machine learning for artistic creation for language games expression planned language sometimes used mean international auxiliary languages other languages designed for actual use human communication some prefer adjective artificial for latter may be perceived pejorative outside esperanto culture term language planning means prescriptions given natural language standardize this regard even natural languages may be artificial some respects prescriptive grammars which date ancient times for classical languages such latin sanskrit are rule-based codifications natural languages such codifications being middle ground between naive natural selection development language its explicit construction term glossopoeia also used mean language construction particularly construction artistic languages quantitative example use conlangs within country hungarian census found

constructed languages see also notes references external links planned constructed artificial terms planned constructed artificial are used differently some traditions for example few speakers interlingua consider their language artificial since they assert that has no invented content interlingua's vocabulary taken from small set natural languages its grammar based closely on these source languages even including some degree irregularity its proponents prefer describe its vocabulary grammar standardized rather than artificial constructed similarly latino sine flexione lsf simplification latin from which inflections have been removed with interlingua some prefer describe its development planning rather than constructing some speakers esperanto esperantidos also avoid term artificial language because they deny that there anything unnatural about use their language human communication by contrast some philosophers have argued that all human languages are conventional artificial françois rabelais for instance stated c'est abus de dire que nous avons une langue naturelle les langues sont par institution arbitraires et conventions des peuples it's abuse say that we have natural language languages are arbitrary conventions peoples by institution artificial language can also refer language that emerges naturally out experimental studies within framework artificial language evolution further fictional experimental languages can be naturalistic that they are meant sound natural have realistic amounts irregularity if derived posteriori from real-world natural language real-world reconstructed proto-language such vulgar latin proto-indo-european from fictional proto-language they try imitate natural processes phonological lexical grammatical change contrast with interlingua they are not usually intended for easy learning communication most artlangers do not consider interlingua be naturalistic sense which this term used artlang criticism thus naturalistic fictional language tends be more difficult complex while interlingua has simpler grammar syntax orthography than its source languages though more complex irregular than esperanto its descendants naturalistic fictional languages typically mimic behaviors natural languages like irregular verbs nouns complicated phonological processes overview terms purpose most constructed languages can broadly be divided into engineered languages engelangs /ˈɛnd͡ʒlæŋz/ further subdivided into logical languages loglangs philosophical languages experimental languages devised for purpose experimentation logic philosophy linguistics auxiliary languages auxlangs devised for international communication also ials for international auxiliary language artistic languages artlangs devised create aesthetic pleasure humorous effect just for fun usually secret languages mystical languages are classified artlangs boundaries between these categories are by no means clear constructed language could easily fall into more than one above categories logical language created for aesthetic reasons would also be classifiable artistic language which might be created by someone with philosophical motives intending for said conlang be used auxiliary language there are no rules either inherent process language construction externally imposed that would limit constructed language fitting only one above categories constructed language can have native speakers if young children learn from parents who speak fluently according ethnologue there are 200–2000 who speak esperanto first language member klingon language institute d'armond speers attempted raise his son native bilingual with english klingon speaker soon constructed language has community fluent speakers especially if has numerous native speakers begins evolve hence loses its constructed status for example modern hebrew its pronunciation norms were developed from existing traditions hebrew such mishnaic hebrew biblical hebrew following general sephardic pronunciation rather than engineered from scratch has undergone considerable changes since state israel was founded hetzron however linguist ghil'ad zuckermann argues that modern hebrew which he terms israeli semito-european hybrid based not only on hebrew but also on yiddish other languages spoken by revivalists zuckermann therefore endorses translation hebrew bible into what he calls israeli esperanto living spoken language has evolved significantly from prescriptive blueprint published so that modern editions fundamenta krestomatio collection early texts language require many footnotes on syntactic lexical differences between early modern esperanto proponents constructed languages often have many reasons for using them famous but disputed sapir–whorf hypothesis sometimes cited this claims that language one speaks influences way one thinks thus better language should allow speaker think more clearly intelligently encompass more points view this was intention suzette haden elgin creating láadan feminist language embodied her feminist science fiction series native tongue constructed language could also be used restrict thought george orwell's newspeak simplify thought toki pona contrast linguists such steven pinker argue that ideas exist independently language for example book language instinct pinker states that children spontaneously re-invent slang even grammar with each generation these linguists argue that attempts control range human thought through reform language would fail concepts like freedom will reappear new words if old words vanish proponents claim particular language makes easier express understand concepts one area more difficult others example can be taken from way various programming languages make easier write certain kinds programs harder write others another reason cited for using constructed language telescope rule which claims that takes less time first learn simple constructed language then natural language than learn only natural language thus if someone wants learn english some suggest learning basic english first constructed languages like esperanto intelingua are fact often simpler due typical lack irregular verbs other grammatical quirks some studies have found that learning esperanto helps learning non-constructed language later see propaedeutic value esperanto codes for constructed languages include iso 639-2 art for conlangs however some constructed languages have their own iso language codes eg eo epo for esperanto jbo for lojban ia ina for interlingua tlh for klingon io ido for ido priori posteriori languages priori constructed language one whose features including vocabulary grammar etc are not based on existing language posteriori language opposite this categorization however not absolute many constructed languages may be both priori posteriori depending on which linguistic factors them are observed priori language priori language from latin priori from former any constructed language which all number features are not based on existing languages but rather invented elaborated work different way allude different purposes some priori languages are designed be international auxiliary languages that remove what could be considered unfair learning advantage for native speakers source language that would otherwise exist for posteriori languages other known philosophical taxonomic languages try categorize their vocabulary either express underlying philosophy make easier recognize new vocabulary experimental there have been many languages constructed test linguistic hypotheses such sapir–whorf hypothesis and/or explore innovative invented linguistic features they are therefore necessarily designed with priori features examples include ithkuil kotava lojban its predecessor loglan both which are also schematic even fictional-setting láadan artistic most artistic languages ie those created for amusement serve natural languages fictional worlds are largely priori both vocabulary grammar among classical fictional natural languages are klingon from science-fiction franchise star trek languages created by fantasy writer j r r tolkien other examples include dothraki valyrian from game thrones atlantean from atlantis lost empire kēlen by sylvia sotomayor aui by w john weilgart láadan both experimental artistic posteriori language posteriori language from latin posteriori from later according louis couturat any constructed language whose elements are borrowed from based on existing languages term can also be extended controlled versions existing languages most commonly used refer vocabulary despite other features distinguishing whether language priori posteriori prevalence distribution respectable traits often key they may be controlled naturalistic schematic controlled controlled language version natural language with improvements make easier learn use such reduced vocabulary simplified grammar etc these include latino sine flexione controlled versions english o basic english o special english o globish naturalistic naturalistic languages are constructed languages which largely imitate grammar vocabulary particular group related languages within family thus being potentially zonal ie auxiliary between speakers these languages occidental also called interlingue interlingua interslavic folkspraak schematic constructed language considered schematic when features more original grammar which usually precise regular avoid ambiguities other obstacles easy study vocabulary coming from languages different families make recognizable possible for potential international auxiliary purposes for that they can be described half priori half posteriori there have been many attempts developing languages with these characteristics including volapük esperanto esperantidos o ido o mundolinco loglan lojban glosa lingwa de planeta history ancient linguistic experiments grammatical speculation dates from classical antiquity appearing for instance plato's cratylus hermogenes's contention that words are not inherently linked what they refer that people apply piece their own voice thing athenaeus naucratis book iii deipnosophistae tells story two figures dionysius sicily alexarchus dionysius sicily created neologisms like menandros virgin from menei waiting andra husband menekratēs pillar from menei remains one place kratei strong ballantion javelin from balletai enantion thrown against someone incidentally more common greek words for those three are parthenos stulos akon alexarchus macedon brother king cassander macedon was founder city ouranopolis athenaeus recounts story told by heracleides lembos that alexarchus introduced peculiar vocabulary referring rooster dawn-crier barber mortal-shaver drachma worked silverand herald aputēs he once wrote somethingto public authorities casandreiaas for what this letter says my opinion not even pythian god could make sense while mechanisms grammar suggested by classical philosophers were designed explain existing languages latin greek sanskrit they were not used construct new grammars roughly contemporary plato his descriptive grammar sanskrit pāṇini constructed set rules for explaining language so that text his grammar may be considered mixture natural constructed language early

magic alchemy sometimes also referred language birds solresol project re-invented concept more pragmatic context 17th 18th century advent philosophical languages 17th century saw rise projects for philosophical priori languages such francis lodwick's common writing groundwork foundation laid so intended for framing new perfect language universal common writing sir thomas urquhart's ekskybalauron logopandecteision george dalgarno's ars signorum john wilkins' essay towards real character philosophical language these early taxonomic conlangs produced systems hierarchical classification that were intended result both spoken written expression leibniz had similar purpose for his lingua generalis aiming at lexicon characters upon which user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically side-effect developing binary calculus these projects were not only occupied with reducing modelling grammar but also with arrangement all human knowledge into characters hierarchies idea that with enlightenment would ultimately lead encyclopédie many these 17th−18th centuries conlangs were pasigraphies purely written languages with no spoken

priori language based on such classification concepts under entry charactère d'alembert critically reviewed projects philosophical languages preceding century after encyclopédie projects for priori languages moved more more lunatic fringe individual authors typically unaware history idea continued propose taxonomic philosophical languages until early 20th century eg ro but most recent engineered languages have had more modest goals some are limited specific field like mathematical formalism calculus eg lincos programming languages others are designed for eliminating syntactical ambiguity eg loglan lojban maximizing conciseness eg ithkuil 19th 20th century auxiliary languages main article international auxiliary language already encyclopédie attention began focus on posteriori auxiliary languages joachim faiguet de villeneuve article on langue wrote short proposition laconic regularized grammar french during 19th century bewildering variety such international auxiliary languages ials were proposed so that louis couturat léopold leau histoire de la langue universelle reviewed projects first these that made any international impact was volapük proposed by johann martin schleyer within decade volapükist clubs were counted all over globe however disagreements between schleyer some prominent users language led schism by mid-1890s fell into obscurity making way for esperanto proposed by ludwik lejzer zamenhof its descendants interlingua most recent auxlang gain significant number speakers emerged when international auxiliary language association published its interlingua–english dictionary accompanying grammar success esperanto did not stop others from trying construct new auxiliary languages such leslie jones' eurolengo which mixes elements english spanish he yafu's mondlango which introduces more english roots instead latin ones loglan its descendants constitute pragmatic return aims priori languages tempered by requirement usability auxiliary

project was developing international auxiliary language with similar collaborative methods voksigid novial languages were both worked on by mailing lists though neither was issued final form several artistic languages have been developed on different constructed language wikis usually involving discussion voting on phonology grammatical rules so forth interesting variation corpus approach exemplified by madjal kalusa mid-2006 where contributors simply read corpus existing sentences add their own sentences perhaps reinforcing existing trends adding new words structures kalusa engine adds ability for visitors rate sentences acceptable unacceptable there no explicit statement grammatical rules explicit definition words this corpus approach meaning words inferred from their use various sentences corpus perhaps different ways by different readers contributors grammatical rules can be inferred from structures sentences that have been rated highest by contributors other
