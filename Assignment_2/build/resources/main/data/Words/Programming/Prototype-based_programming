object-oriented programming which behaviour reuse known inheritance performed via process reusing existing objects via delegation that serve prototypes this model can also be known prototypal prototype-oriented classless instance-based programming delegation language feature that supports prototype-based programming fruit bowl serves one example fruit object would represent properties functionality fruit general banana object would be cloned from fruit object would also be extended include general properties specific bananas each individual banana object would be cloned from generic banana object first prototype-oriented programming language was self developed by david ungar randall smith mid-1980s research topics object-oriented language design since late 1990s classless paradigm has grown increasingly popular some current prototype-oriented languages are javascript other ecmascript implementations jscript flash's actionscript lua cecil newtonscript io ioke moo rebol lisaac ahk contents design implementation object construction delegation concatenation criticism languages supporting prototype-based programming see also references further reading design implementation prototypal inheritance javascript described by douglas crockford you make prototype objects then … make new instances objects are mutable javascript so we can augment new instances giving them new fields methods these can then act prototypes for even newer objects we don't need classes make lots similar objects… objects inherit from objects what could be more object oriented than that advocates prototype-based programming argue that encourages programmer focus on behavior some set examples only later worry about classifying these objects into archetypal objects that are later used fashion similar classes many prototype-based systems encourage alteration prototypes during run-time whereas only very few class-based object-oriented systems such dynamic object-oriented system common lisp dylan objective-c perl python ruby smalltalk allow classes be altered during execution program almost all prototype-based systems are based on interpreted dynamically typed languages systems based on statically typed languages are technically feasible however omega language discussed prototype-based programming example such system though according omega's website even omega not exclusively static but rather its compiler may choose use static binding where this possible may improve efficiency program object construction prototype-based languages there are no explicit classes objects inherit directly from other objects through prototype property prototype property called prototype self proto io proto javascript there are two methods constructing new objects ex nihilo from nothing object creation through cloning existing object former supported through some form object literal declarations where objects can be defined at runtime through special syntax such {} passed directly variable while most systems support variety cloning ex nihilo object creation not prominent class-based languages new instance constructed through class's constructor function special function that reserves block memory for object's members properties methods returns reference that block optional set constructor arguments can be passed function are usually held properties resulting instance will inherit all methods properties that were defined class which acts kind template from which similar typed objects can be constructed systems that support ex nihilo object creation allow new objects be created from scratch without cloning from existing prototype such systems provide special syntax for specifying properties behaviors new objects without referencing existing objects many prototype languages there exists root object often called object which set default prototype for all other objects created run-time which carries commonly needed methods such tostring function return description object string one useful aspect ex nihilo object creation ensure that new object's slot properties methods names do not have namespace conflicts with top-level object object javascript language one can do this by using null prototype ie objectcreatenull cloning refers process whereby new object constructed by copying behavior existing object its prototype new object then carries all qualities original from this point on new object can be modified some systems resulting child object maintains explicit link via delegation resemblance its prototype changes prototype cause corresponding changes be apparent its clone other systems such forth-like programming language kevo do not propagate change from prototype this fashion instead follow more concatenative model where changes cloned objects do not automatically propagate across descendants // example true prototypal inheritance style // javascript // ex nihilo object creation using literal // object notation {} var foo = {name foo one two 2} // another ex nihilo object var bar = {two two three 3} // objectsetprototypeof method introduced ecmascript // for sake simplicity let us pretend // that following line works regardless // engine used objectsetprototypeofbar foo // foo now prototype bar // if we try access foo's properties from bar // from now on we'll succeed barone // resolves // child object's properties are also accessible barthree // resolves // own properties shadow prototype properties bartwo // resolves two barname // unaffected resolves foo fooname // resolves foo this example js + see var foo = {one two 2} // bar] = foo var bar = objectcreate foo barthree = barone // bartwo // barthree // delegation prototype-based languages that use delegation language runtime capable dispatching correct method finding right piece data simply by following series delegation pointers from object its prototype until match found all that required establish this behavior-sharing between objects delegation pointer unlike relationship between class instance class-based object-oriented languages relationship between prototype its offshoots does not require that child object have memory structural similarity prototype beyond this link such child object can continue be modified amended over time without rearranging structure its associated prototype class-based systems also important note that not only data but also methods can be added changed for this reason some prototype-based languages refer both data methods slots members concatenation under pure prototyping which also referred concatenative prototyping exemplified kevo language there are no visible pointers links original prototype from which object cloned prototype parent object copied rather than linked result changes prototype will not be reflected cloned objects main conceptual difference under this arrangement that changes made prototype object are not automatically propagated clones this may be seen advantage disadvantage however kevo does provide additional primitives for publishing changes across sets objects based on their similarity — so-called family resemblances clone family mechanism — rather than through taxonomic origin typical delegation model also sometimes claimed that delegation-based prototyping has additional disadvantage that changes child object may affect later operation parent however this problem not inherent delegation-based model does not exist delegation-based languages such javascript which ensure that changes child object are always recorded child object itself never parents ie child's value shadows parent's value rather than changing parent's value simplistic implementations concatenative prototyping will have faster member lookup than delegation-based prototyping because there no need follow chain parent objects but will conversely use more memory because all slots are copied rather than there being single slot pointing parent object more sophisticated implementations can avoid these problems however although trade-offs between speed memory are required for example systems with concatenative prototyping can use copy-on-write implementation allow for behind-the-scenes data sharing — such approach indeed followed by kevo conversely systems with delegation-based prototyping can use caching speed up data lookup criticism advocates class-based object models who criticize prototype-based systems often have concerns similar concerns that proponents static type systems for programming languages have dynamic type systems see datatype usually such concerns involve correctness safety predictability efficiency programmer unfamiliarity on first three points classes are often seen analogous types most statically typed object-oriented languages they serve that role are proposed provide contractual guarantees their instances users their instances that they will behave some given fashion regarding efficiency declaring classes simplifies many compiler optimizations that allow developing efficient method instance-variable lookup for self language much development time was spent on developing compiling interpreting techniques improve performance prototype-based systems versus class-based systems common criticism made against prototype-based languages that community software developers unfamiliar with them despite popularity market permeation javascript this knowledge level prototype-based systems seems be increasing with proliferation javascript frameworks complex use javascript
