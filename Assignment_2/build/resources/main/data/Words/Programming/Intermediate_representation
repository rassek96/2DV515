compilers & toolchains llvm gnu compiler collection gcc v t e intermediate representation ir data structure code used internally by compiler virtual machine represent source code ir designed be conducive for further processing such optimization translation good ir must be accurate – capable representing source code without loss information – independent any particular source target language ir may take one several forms in-memory data structure special tuple- stack-based code readable by program latter case also called intermediate language canonical example found most modern compilers where linear human-readable text representing program transformed into intermediate graph structure that allows flow analysis re-arrangement before creating sequence actual cpu instructions use intermediate representation such this allows compiler systems like gnu compiler collection llvm be used by many different source languages generate code for many different target architectures contents intermediate language o languages other see also references external links intermediate language intermediate language language abstract machine designed aid analysis computer programs term comes from their use compilers where source code program translated into form more suitable for code-improving transformations before being used generate object machine code for target machine design intermediate language typically differs from that practical machine language three fundamental ways each instruction represents exactly one fundamental operation eg shift-add addressing modes common microprocessors are not present control flow information may not be included instruction set number processor registers available may be large even limitless popular format for intermediate languages three-address code term also used refer languages used intermediates by some high-level programming languages which do not output object machine code themselves but output intermediate language only this intermediate language submitted compiler for such language which then outputs finished object machine code this usually done ease process optimization increase portability by using intermediate language that has compilers for many processors operating systems such c languages used for this fall complexity between high-level languages low-level languages such assembly languages languages though not explicitly designed intermediate language c's nature abstraction assembly its ubiquity de facto system language unix-like other operating systems has made popular intermediate language

have been designed provide c's features portable assembly language including c-- c intermediate language any language targeting virtual machine p-code machine can be considered intermediate language java bytecode microsoft's common intermediate language intermediate language designed be shared by all compilers for net framework before static dynamic compilation machine code while most intermediate languages are designed support statically typed languages parrot intermediate representation designed support dynamically typed languages—initially perl python timi high level that targets ibm system i platform o-code for bcpl matlab precompiled code microsoft p-code gnu compiler collection gcc uses several intermediate languages internally simplify portability cross-compilation among these languages are historical register transfer language rtl tree language generic ssa-based gimple standard portable intermediate representation spir/spir-v llvm intermediate representation
