system programming language from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search system programming language usually refers programming language used for system programming such languages are designed for writing system software which usually requires different development approaches when compared with application software system software computer software designed operate control computer hardware provide platform for running application software system software includes software categories such operating systems utility software device drivers compilers linkers contents features history o mid-level languages o higher-level languages major languages see also notes references external links features contrast with application languages system programming languages typically offer more-direct access physical hardware machine archetypical system programming language this sense was bcpl system programming languages often lack built-in input/output i/o facilities because system-software project usually develops its own i/o mechanisms builds on top basic monitor i/o screen management facilities distinction between languages used for system programming application programming became blurred over time with widespread popularity pl/i c pascal history earliest system software was written assembly language primarily because there was no alternative but also for reasons including efficiency object code compilation time ease debugging application languages such fortran were used for system programming although they usually still required some routines be written assembly language mid-level languages mid-level languages have much syntax facilities higher level language but also provide direct access language well providing assembly language machine features earliest these was espol on burroughs mainframes about followed by niklaus wirth's pl360 initially written on burroughs system cross compiler which had general syntax algol but whose statements directly manipulated cpu registers memory other languages this category include mol-360 pl/s example typical pl360 statement r9 = r8 r7 shll r6 signifying that registers should be and'ed together result shifted left bits result that or'ed with contents register result placed into register higher-level languages while pl360 at semantic level assembly language another kind system programming language operates at higher semantic level but has specific extensions designed make language suitable for system programming early example this kind language lrltran which extended fortran with features for character bit manipulation pointers directly-addressed jump tables subsequently languages such c were developed where combination features was sufficient write system software compiler could be developed that generated efficient object programs on modest hardware such language generally omits features that cannot be implemented efficiently adds small number machine-dependent features needed access specific hardware capabilities inline assembly code such c's asm statement often used for this purpose although many such languages were developed c c++ are ones that have survived strongly statically typed languages such ada were invented due issues involved developing applications with c c++ ada still use many areas updated for tentatively called ada
