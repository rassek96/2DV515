stable release / september months ago preview release 251-rc2 / august months ago repository gitsavannahgnuorg/cgit/emacsgit written c emacs lisp operating system cross-platform gnu linux windows os x bsds more available english type text editor license gnu gplv3 website wwwgnuorg/software/emacs gnu emacs most popular most ported emacs text editor was created by gnu project founder richard stallman common with other varieties emacs gnu emacs extensible using turing complete programming language gnu emacs has been called most powerful text editor available today with proper support from underlying system gnu emacs able display files multiple character sets has been able simultaneously display most human languages since at least throughout its history gnu emacs has been central component gnu project flagship free software movement gnu emacs sometimes abbreviated gnumacs especially differentiate from other emacs variants tag line for gnu emacs extensible self-documenting text

platforms forks o xemacs o other forks gnu emacs release history references further reading external links history richard stallman founder gnu project author gnu emacs stallman wrote first emacs “editor macros” began work on gnu emacs produce free software alternative proprietary gosling emacs gnu emacs was initially based on gosling emacs but stallman's replacement its mocklisp interpreter with true lisp interpreter required that nearly all its code be rewritten this became first program released by nascent gnu project gnu emacs written c provides emacs lisp also implemented c extension language version first public release was made on march first widely distributed version gnu emacs was version released later early versions gnu emacs were numbered 1xx with initial digit denoting version c core was dropped after version was thought that major number would never change thus major version skipped from new third version number was added represent changes made by user sites current numbering scheme number with two components signifies release version with development versions having three components gnu emacs was later ported unix offered more features than gosling emacs particular full-featured lisp its extension language soon replaced gosling emacs de facto unix emacs editor markus hess exploited security flaw gnu emacs' email subsystem his cracking spree which he gained superuser access unix computers although users commonly submitted patches elisp code netemacs newsgroup participation gnu emacs development was relatively restricted until was used example cathedral development style cathedral bazaar project has since adopted public development mailing list anonymous cvs access development took place single cvs trunk until today uses git dvcs richard stallman has remained principal maintainer gnu emacs but he has stepped back from role at times stefan monnier chong yidong have overseen maintenance since on september monnier announced that he would be stepping down maintainer effective with feature freeze emacs longtime contributor john wiegley was announced new maintainer on november licensing terms gnu general public license gpl state that emacs source code including both c emacs lisp components are freely available for examination modification redistribution older versions gnu emacs documentation appeared under ad-hoc license that required inclusion certain text any modified copy gnu emacs user's manual for example this included instructions for obtaining gnu emacs richard stallman's essay gnu manifesto xemacs manuals which were inherited from older gnu emacs manuals when fork occurred have same license newer versions documentation use gnu free documentation license with invariant sections that require inclusion same documents that manuals proclaim themselves gnu manuals for gnu emacs like many other gnu packages remains policy accept significant code contributions only if copyright holder executes suitable disclaimer assignment their copyright interest free software foundation bug fixes minor code contributions fewer than lines are exempt this policy place so that fsf can defend software court if its copyleft license violated was noticed that gnu emacs had been violating gpl for two years richard stallman described this incident very bad mistake which was promptly fixed using gnu emacs editing multiple dired buffers gnu emacs editing c source code gnu emacs editing compiling c++ code from gnu emacs commands its normal editing mode gnu emacs behaves like other text editors allows user insert characters with corresponding keys move editing point with arrow keys escape key sequences pressing control key and/or meta key alt key super keys conjunction with regular key produces modified keystrokes that invoke functions from emacs lisp environment commands such save-buffer save-buffers-kill-emacs combine multiple modified keystrokes some gnu emacs commands work by invoking external program such ispell for spell-checking gnu compiler collection gcc for program compilation parsing program's output displaying result gnu emacs emacs also supports inferior processes—long-lived processes that interact with emacs buffer this used implement shell-mode running unix shell inferior process well repl modes for various programming languages emacs' support for external processes makes attractive environment for interactive programming along lines interlisp smalltalk users who prefer ibm common user access-style keys can use cua-mode package that originally was third-party add-on but has been included gnu emacs since version minibuffer emacs uses minibuffer normally bottommost line present status request information—the functions that would typically be performed by dialog boxes most guis minibuffer holds information such text target search name file read save when applicable command line completion available using tab space keys file management display emacs keeps text data structures known buffers buffers may may not be displayed onscreen all buffer features are accessible emacs lisp program user interface user can create new buffers dismiss unwanted ones several buffers can exist at same time there no upper limit on number buffers emacs allows other than hardware memory limits advanced users may amass hundreds open buffers various types relating their current work some buffers contain text loaded from text files which user can edit save back permanent storage these buffers are said be visiting files buffers also serve display other data such output emacs commands dired directory listings documentation strings displayed by help library notification messages that other editors would be displayed dialog box these notifications are displayed briefly minubuffer gnu emacs provides messages buffer that keeps history most recent notifications this type buffers can also serve input output areas for external process such shell repl buffers which emacs creates on its own are typically named with asterisks on each end distinguish from user buffers list open buffers itself displayed this type buffer most emacs key sequences remain functional any buffer for example standard ctrl-s isearch function can be used search filenames dired buffers file list can be saved text file just any other buffer dired buffers can be switched writable mode which filenames attributes can be edited textually when buffer saved changes are written filesystem this allows multiple files be renamed using search replace features emacs when so equipped emacs displays image files buffers emacs binary safe 8-bit clean emacs can split editing area into separate sections called windows feature that has been available since predating graphical user interface common use emacs terminology windows are similar what other systems call frames panes - rectangular portion program's display that can be updated interacted with independently each emacs window has status bar called mode line displayed by default at bottom edge window emacs windows are available both text-terminal graphical modes allow more than one buffer several parts buffer be displayed at once common applications are display dired buffer along with contents files current directory there are special modes make file buffer follow file highlighted dired display source code program one window while another displays shell buffer with results compiling program run debugger along with shell buffer running program work on code while displaying man page other documentation possibly loaded over world wide web using one emacs' built-in web browsers simply display multiple files for editing at once such header along with its implementation file for c-based languages addition there follow-mode minor mode that chains windows display non-overlapping portions buffer using follow-mode single file can be displayed multiple side-by-side windows that update appropriately when scrolled emacs windows are tiled cannot appear above below their companions emacs can launch multiple frames which are displayed individual windows graphical environment on text terminal multiple frames are displayed stacked filling entire terminal can be switched using standard emacs commands major modes gnu emacs can edit variety different types text adapts its behavior by entering add-on modes called major modes defined major modes exist for many different file types including ordinary text files source code many programming languages html documents tex latex documents each major mode involves emacs lisp program that extends editor behave more conveniently for specified type text major modes typically provide some all following common features syntax highlighting font lock combinations fonts colors termed faces that differentiate between document elements such keywords comments automatic indentation maintain consistent formatting within file automatic insertion elements required by structure document such spaces newlines parentheses special editing commands such commands jump beginning end function while editing programming file commands validate documents insert closing tags while working with markup languages such xml minor modes use minor modes enables further customization gnu emacs editing buffer can use only one major mode at time but multiple minor modes can operate simultaneously these may operate directly on documents way major mode for c programming language defines separate minor mode for each its popular indent styles they may alter editing environment examples latter include mode that adds ability undo changes window configuration one that performs on-the-fly syntax checking there also minor mode that allows multiple major modes be used single file for convenience when editing document which multiple programming languages are embedded batch mode gnu emacs supports capability use interpreter for emacs lisp language without displaying text editor user interface batch mode user configuration not loaded terminal interrupt characters c-c c-z will have their usual effect exiting program suspending execution instead invoking emacs keybindings gnu emacs has command line options specify either file load execute emacs lisp function may be passed from command line emacs will start up execute passed-in file function print results then exit shebang line /usr/bin/emacs --script allows creation standalone scripts emacs lisp batch mode not emacs mode per se but describes alternate execution mode for emacs program manuals gnu emacs manual cover art by etienne suvasa cover design by matt lee apart from built-in documentation gnu emacs has unusually long detailed manual electronic copy gnu emacs manual written by richard stallman bundled with gnu emacs can be viewed with built-in info browser two additional manuals emacs lisp reference manual by bil lewis richard stallman dan laliberte introduction programming emacs lisp by robert chassell are included all three manuals are also published book form by free software foundation xemacs manual similar gnu emacs manual from which forked at same time that xemacs software forked from gnu emacs internationalization gnu emacs has support for many alphabets scripts writing systems cultural conventions provides spell-checking for many languages by calling external programs such ispell version added support for bidirectional text left-to-right right-to-left writing direction for languages such arabic persian hebrew many character encoding systems including utf-8 are supported gnu emacs uses utf-8 for its encoding gnu while prior versions used their own encoding internally performed conversion upon load save internal encoding used by xemacs similar that gnu emacs but differs details gnu emacs user interface originated english with exception beginners' tutorial has not been translated into any other language subsystem called emacspeak enables visually impaired blind users control editor through audio feedback extensibility gnu emacs with auctex set tools for editing tex latex documents behavior gnu emacs can be modified extended almost without limit by incorporating emacs lisp programs that define new commands new buffer modes new keymaps add command-line options so on many extensions providing user-facing functionality define major mode either for new file type build non-text-editing user interface others define only commands minor modes provide functions that enhance another extension many extensions are bundled with gnu emacs installation

incorporating various text effects performance gnu emacs often ran noticeably slower than rival text editors on systems which was first implemented because loading interpreting its lisp-based code incurs performance overhead modern computers are powerful enough run gnu emacs without slowdowns but versions prior released couldn't edit files larger than mb file size limit was raised successive versions bit versions after gnu emacs can edit files up mb size emacs compiled on 64-bit machine can handle much larger buffers platforms gnu emacs has become one most-ported non-trivial computer
