has been suggested that this article be merged with typesystemtypechecking discuss proposed since may computer programming programming languages are often colloquially classified strongly typed weakly typed loosely typed these terms do not have precise definition but general strongly typed language more likely generate error refuse compile if argument passed function does not closely match expected type on other hand very weakly typed language may produce unpredictable results may perform implicit type conversion different but related concept latent typing contents history definitions strong weak o implicit type conversions type punning o pointers o untagged unions o static type-checking o dynamic type-checking variation across programming languages see also references history liskov zilles defined strongly-typed language one which whenever object passed from calling function called function its type must be compatible with type declared called function jackson wrote strongly typed language each data area will have distinct type each process will state its communication requirements terms these types definitions strong weak number different language design decisions have been referred evidence strong weak typing fact many these are more accurately understood presence absence type safety memory safety static type-checking dynamic type-checking implicit type conversions type punning some programming languages make easy use value one type if were value another type this sometimes described weak typing for example aahz maruch opines that coercion occurs when you have statically typed language you use syntactic features language force usage one type if were different type consider common use void c coercion usually symptom weak typing conversion on other hand creates brand-new object appropriate type another example gcc describes this type-punning warns that will break strict aliasing thiago macieira discusses several problems that can arise when type-punning causes compiler make inappropriate optimizations there are many examples languages that allow implicit type conversions but type-safe manner for example both c++ c allow programs define operators convert value from one type another semantically meaningful way when c++ compiler encounters such conversion treats operation just like function call contrast converting value c type void unsafe operation that invisible compiler pointers some programming languages expose pointers if they were numeric values allow users perform arithmetic on them these languages are sometimes referred weakly typed since pointer arithmetic can be used bypass language's type system untagged unions some programming languages support untagged unions which allow value one type be viewed if were value another type static type-checking luca cardelli's article typeful programming strong type system described one which there no possibility unchecked runtime type error other writing absence unchecked run-time errors referred safety type safety tony hoare's early papers call this property security dynamic type-checking some programming languages do not have static type-checking many such languages easy write programs that would be rejected by most static type-checkers for example variable might store either number boolean value false variation across programming languages note that some these definitions are contradictory others are merely conceptually independent still others are special cases with additional constraints other more liberal less strong definitions because wide divergence among these definitions possible defend claims about most programming languages that they are either strongly weakly typed for instance java pascal ada c require all variables have declared type support use explicit casts arithmetic values other arithmetic types java c ada pascal are sometimes said be more strongly typed than c claim that probably based on fact that c supports more kinds implicit conversions c also allows pointer values be explicitly cast while java pascal do not java itself may be considered more strongly typed than pascal manners evading static type system java are controlled by java virtual machine's type system c similar java that respect though allows disabling dynamic type checking by explicitly putting code segments unsafe context pascal's type system has been described too strong because size array string part its type making some programming tasks very difficult smalltalk perl ruby python self are all strongly typed sense that typing errors are prevented at runtime they do little implicit type conversion but these languages make no use static type checking compiler does not check enforce type constraint rules term duck typing now used describe dynamic typing paradigm used by languages this group lisp family languages are all strongly typed sense that typing errors are prevented at runtime some lisp dialects like common lisp clojure do support various forms type declarations some compilers cmucl related use these declarations together with type inference enable various optimizations also limited forms compile time type checks standard ml f ocaml haskell are statically type-checked but compiler automatically infers precise type for all values visual basic hybrid language addition variables with declared types also possible declare variable variant data type that can store data any type its implicit casts are fairly liberal where for example one can sum string variants pass result into integer variable assembly language forth have been said be untyped there no type checking up programmer ensure that data given functions appropriate type any type conversion required explicit for this reason writers who wish write unambiguously about type systems often eschew term strong typing favor specific expressions such type safety see also data type includes more thorough discussion typing issues comparison programming
