type inference from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search type systems general concepts type safety major categories static vs dynamic manifest vs inferred nominal vs structural duck typing minor categories dependent flow-sensitive gradual latent substructural unique see also strong weak typing type inference refers automatic deduction data type expression programming language if some but not all type annotations are already present termed type reconstruction reverse operation type inference called type erasure feature present some strongly statically typed languages often characteristic functional programming languages general some languages that include type inference include c++11 c starting with version clean d f freebasic go haskell ml nim ocaml opa rust scala swift visual basic starting with version ability infer types automatically makes many programming tasks easier leaving programmer free omit type annotations while still permitting type checking contents nontechnical explanation technical description example hindley–milner type inference algorithm side-effects using most general type references external links nontechnical explanation most programming languages all values have data type explicitly declared at compile time limiting values particular expression can take on at run-time increasingly just-in-time compilation renders distinction between run time compile time moot however historically if type value known only at run-time these languages are dynamically typed other languages type expression known only at compile time these languages are statically typed statically typed languages input output types functions local variables ordinarily must be explicitly provided by type annotations for example c int addoneint x { int result / declare integer result / result = x + return result } signature this function definition int addoneint x declares that addone function that takes one argument integer returns integer int result declares that local variable result integer hypothetical language supporting type inference code might be written like this instead addonex { var result / inferred-type variable result / var result2 / inferred-type variable result / result = x + result2 = x + / this line won't work proposed language / return result } this identical how code written language dart except that subject some added constraints described below would be possible infer types all variables at compile time example above compiler would infer that result x have type integer since constant type integer hence that addone function int -> int variable result2 isn't used legal manner so wouldn't have type imaginary language which last example written compiler would assume that absence information contrary + takes two integers returns one integer this how works for example ocaml from this type inferencer can infer that type x + integer which means result integer thus return value addone integer similarly since + requires both its arguments be same type x must be integer thus addone accepts one integer argument however subsequent line result2 calculated by adding decimal with floating-point arithmetic causing conflict use x for both integer floating-point expressions correct type-inference algorithm for such situation has been known since has been known be correct since revisits prior inferences uses most general type from outset this case floating-point this can however have detrimental implications for instance using floating-point from outset can introduce precision issues that would have not been there with integer type frequently however degenerate type-inference algorithms are used that cannot backtrack instead generate error message such situation this behavior may be preferable type inference may not always be neutral algorithmically illustrated by prior floating-point precision issue algorithm intermediate generality implicitly declares result2 floating-point variable addition implicitly converts x floating point this can be correct if calling contexts never supply floating point argument such situation shows difference between type inference which does not involve type conversion implicit type conversion which forces data different data type often without restrictions finally significant downside complex type-inference algorithm that resulting type inference resolution not going be obvious humans notably because backtracking which can be detrimental code primarily intended be comprehensible humans recent emergence just-in-time compilation allows for hybrid approaches where type arguments supplied by various calling context known at compile time can generate large number compiled versions same function each compiled version can then be optimized for different set types for instance jit compilation allows there be at least two compiled versions addone version that accepts integer input uses implicit type conversion version that accepts floating-point number input uses floating point instructions throughout technical description type inference ability automatically deduce either partially fully type expression at compile time compiler often able infer type variable type signature function without explicit type annotations having been given many cases possible omit type annotations from program completely if type inference system robust enough program language simple enough obtain information required infer type expression compiler either gathers this information aggregate subsequent reduction type annotations given for its subexpressions through implicit understanding type various atomic values eg true bool integer real etc through recognition eventual reduction expressions implicitly typed atomic values that compiler for type inferring language able compile program completely without type annotations complex forms higher-order programming polymorphism not always possible for compiler infer much type annotations are occasionally necessary for disambiguation for instance type inference with polymorphic recursion known be undecidable furthermore explicit type annotations can be used optimize code by forcing compiler use more specific faster/smaller type than had inferred relative program analysis type inference special case points-to analysis that uses type abstraction on pointer targets example for example let us consider haskell function map which applies function each element list may be defined map f = map f firstrest = f first map f rest type inference on map function proceeds intuitively follows map function two arguments so its type constrained be form → b → c haskell patterns firstrest always match lists so second argument must be list type b = for some type d its first argument f applied argument first which must have type d corresponding with type list argument so f d → e means type for some type e return value map f finally list whatever f produces so putting parts together we obtain map d → e → → nothing special about type variables so we can simply relabel this map → b → → turns out that this also most general type since no further constraints apply note that inferred type map parametrically polymorphic type arguments results f are not inferred but left type variables so map can be applied functions lists various types long actual types match each invocation hindley–milner type inference algorithm main article hindley–milner type system algorithm first used perform type inference now informally termed hindley–milner algorithm although algorithm should properly be attributed damas milner origin this algorithm type inference algorithm for simply typed lambda calculus that was devised by haskell curry robert feys j roger hindley extended this work proved that their algorithm always inferred most general type robin milner independently hindley's work provided equivalent algorithm algorithm w luis damas finally proved that milner's algorithm complete extended support systems with polymorphic references side-effects using most general type by design type inference especially correct backtracking type inference will introduce use most general type appropriate however this can have implications more general types may not always be algorithmically neutral typical cases being floating-point being considered general type integer while floating-point will introduce precision issues variant/dynamic types being considered general type other types which will introduce casting rules comparison that could be different for instance such types use '+' operator for both numeric additions string concatenations but what operation performed determined dynamically rather than statically references bryan o'sullivan don stewart john goerzen
