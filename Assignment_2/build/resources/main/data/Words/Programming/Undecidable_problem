undecidable problem from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search computability theory computational complexity theory undecidable problem decision problem for which known be impossible construct single algorithm that always leads correct yes-or-no answer decision problem any arbitrary yes-or-no question on infinite set inputs because this traditional define decision problem equivalently set inputs for which problem returns yes these inputs can be natural numbers but also other values some other kind such strings formal language using some encoding such gödel numbering strings can be encoded natural numbers thus decision problem informally phrased terms formal language also equivalent set natural numbers keep formal definition simple phrased terms subsets natural numbers formally decision problem subset natural numbers corresponding informal problem that deciding whether given number set decision problem called decidable effectively solvable if recursive set problem called partially decidable semi-decidable solvable provable if recursively enumerable set this means that there exists algorithm that halts eventually when answer yes but may run for ever if answer no partially decidable problems any other problems that are not decidable are called undecidable contents computability theory relationship with gödel's incompleteness theorem examples undecidable problems examples undecidable statements see also references computability theory computability theory halting problem decision problem which can be stated follows given description arbitrary program finite input decide whether program finishes running will run forever alan turing proved that general algorithm running on turing machine that solves halting problem for all possible program-input pairs necessarily cannot exist hence halting problem undecidable for turing machines relationship with gödel's incompleteness theorem concepts raised by gödel's incompleteness theorems are very similar those raised by halting problem proofs are quite similar fact weaker form first incompleteness theorem easy consequence undecidability halting problem this weaker form differs from standard statement incompleteness theorem by asserting that complete consistent sound axiomatization all statements about natural numbers unachievable sound part weakening means that we require axiomatic system question prove only true statements about natural numbers important observe that statement standard form gödel's first incompleteness theorem completely unconcerned with question truth but only concerns issue whether can be proven weaker form theorem can be proved from undecidability halting problem follows assume that we have consistent complete axiomatization all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers then we can build algorithm that enumerates all these statements this means that there algorithm nn that given natural number n computes true first-order logic statement about natural numbers such that for all true statements there at least one n such that nn yields that statement now suppose we want decide if algorithm with representation halts on input i we know that this statement can be expressed with first-order logic statement say ha i since axiomatization complete follows that either there n such that nn = ha i there n' such that nn' = ¬ ha i so if we iterate over all n until we either find ha i its negation we will always halt this means that this gives us algorithm decide halting problem since we know that there cannot be such algorithm follows that assumption that there consistent complete axiomatization all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers must be false examples undecidable problems main article list undecidable problems undecidable problems can be related different topics such logic abstract machines topology note that since there are uncountably many undecidable problems any list even one infinite length necessarily incomplete examples undecidable statements see also list statements independent zfc independence mathematical logic there are two distinct senses word undecidable contemporary use first these sense used relation gödel's theorems that statement being neither provable nor refutable specified deductive system second sense used relation computability theory applies not statements but decision problems which are countably infinite sets questions each requiring yes no answer such problem said be undecidable if there no computable function that correctly answers every question problem set connection between these two that if decision problem undecidable recursion theoretical sense then there no consistent effective formal system which proves for every question problem either answer yes answer no because two meanings word undecidable term independent sometimes used instead undecidable for neither provable nor refutable sense usage independent also ambiguous however can mean just not provable leaving open whether independent statement might be refuted undecidability statement particular deductive system does not itself address question whether truth value statement well-defined whether can be determined by other means undecidability only implies that particular deductive system being considered does not prove truth falsity statement whether there exist so-called absolutely undecidable statements whose truth value can never be known ill-specified controversial point among various philosophical schools one first problems suspected be undecidable second sense term was word problem for groups first posed by max dehn which asks if there finitely presented group for which no algorithm exists determine whether two words are equivalent this was shown be case combined work gödel paul cohen has given two concrete examples undecidable statements first sense term continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor refuted zfc standard axiomatization set theory axiom choice can neither be proved nor refuted zf which all zfc axioms except axiom choice these results do not require incompleteness theorem gödel proved that neither these statements could be disproved zf zfc set theory 1960s cohen proved that neither provable from zf continuum hypothesis cannot be proven from zfc russian mathematician yuri matiyasevich showed that hilbert's tenth problem posed challenge next century mathematicians cannot be solved hilbert's challenge sought algorithm which finds all solutions diophantine equation diophantine equation more general case fermat's last theorem we seek integer roots polynomial any number variables with integer coefficients since we have only one equation but n variables infinitely many solutions exist are easy find complex plane however problem becomes impossible if solutions are constrained integer values only matiyasevich showed this problem be unsolvable by mapping diophantine equation recursively enumerable set invoking gödel's incompleteness theorem alan turing proved that halting problem—the question whether not turing machine halts on given program—is undecidable second sense term this result was later generalized by rice's theorem whitehead problem group theory was shown be undecidable first sense term standard set theory paris harrington proved that paris-harrington principle version ramsey theorem undecidable axiomatization arithmetic given by peano axioms but can be proven be true larger system second-order arithmetic kruskal's tree theorem which has applications computer science also undecidable from peano axioms but provable set theory fact kruskal's tree theorem its finite form undecidable much stronger system codifying principles acceptable on basis philosophy mathematics called predicativism goodstein's theorem statement about ramsey theory natural numbers that kirby paris showed undecidable peano arithmetic gregory chaitin produced undecidable statements algorithmic information theory proved another incompleteness theorem that setting chaitin's theorem states that for any theory that can represent enough arithmetic there upper bound c such that no specific number can be proven that theory have kolmogorov complexity greater than c while gödel's theorem related liar paradox chaitin's result related berry's paradox researchers kurtz simon
