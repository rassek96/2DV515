physicist tim berners-lee contractor at cern proposed prototyped enquire system for cern researchers use share documents berners-lee wrote memo proposing internet-based hypertext system berners-lee specified html wrote browser server software late that year berners-lee cern data systems engineer robert cailliau collaborated on joint request for funding but project was not formally adopted by cern his personal notes from he listed some many areas which hypertext used put encyclopedia first first publicly available description html was document called html tags first mentioned on internet by tim berners-lee late describes elements comprising initial relatively simple design html except for hyperlink tag these were strongly influenced by sgmlguid in-house standard generalized markup language sgml-based documentation format at cern eleven these elements still exist html html markup language that web browsers use interpret compose text images other material into visual audible web pages default characteristics for every item html markup are defined browser these characteristics can be altered enhanced by web page designer's additional use css many text elements are found iso technical report tr techniques for using sgml which turn covers features early text formatting languages such that used by runoff command developed early 1960s for ctss compatible time-sharing system operating system these formatting commands were derived from commands used by typesetters manually format documents however sgml concept generalized markup based on elements nested annotated ranges with attributes rather than merely print effects with also separation structure markup html has been progressively moved this direction with css berners-lee considered html be application sgml was formally defined such by internet engineering task force ietf with mid-1993 publication first proposal for html specification hypertext markup language html internet-draft by berners-lee dan connolly which included sgml document type definition define grammar draft expired after six months but was notable for its acknowledgment ncsa mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images reflecting ietf's philosophy basing standards on successful prototypes similarly dave raggett's competing internet-draft html+ hypertext markup format from late suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables fill-out forms after html html+ drafts expired early ietf created html working group which completed html first html specification intended be treated standard against which future implementations should be based further development under auspices ietf was stalled by competing interests since html specifications have been maintained with input from commercial software vendors by world wide web consortium w3c however html also became international standard iso/iec html was published late with further errata published through development began on html5 web hypertext application technology working group whatwg which became joint deliverable with w3c completed standardized on october html versions timeline november html was published ietf rfc supplemental rfcs added capabilities november rfc form-based file upload may rfc tables august rfc client-side image maps january rfc internationalization january html was published w3c recommendation was first version developed standardized exclusively by w3c ietf had closed its html working group on september initially code-named wilbur html dropped math formulas entirely reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions adopted most netscape's visual markup tags netscape's blink element microsoft's marquee element were omitted due mutual agreement between two companies markup for mathematical formulas similar that html was not standardized until months later mathml december html was published w3c recommendation offers three variations strict which deprecated elements are forbidden transitional which deprecated elements are allowed frameset which mostly only frame related elements are allowed initially code-named cougar html adopted many browser-specific element types attributes but at same time sought phase out netscape's visual markup features by marking them deprecated favor style sheets html sgml application conforming iso – sgml april html was reissued with minor edits without incrementing version number december html was published w3c recommendation offers same three variations html its last errata were published on may may iso/iec iso html based on html strict was published iso/iec international standard iso this standard falls domain iso/iec jtc1/sc34 iso/iec joint technical committee subcommittee – document description processing languages after html there was no new version html for many years development parallel xml-based language xhtml occupied w3c's html working group through early mid-2000s october html5 was published w3c recommendation html draft version timeline logo html5 october html tags informal cern document listing html tags was first mentioned public june first informal draft html dtd with seven subsequent revisions july august august november november november november november html dtd first with version number based on rcs revisions which start with rather than informal draft june hypertext markup language was published by ietf iiir working group internet draft rough proposal for standard was replaced by second version one month later followed by six further drafts published by ietf itself that finally led html rfc november html+ was published by ietf internet draft was competing proposal hypertext markup language draft expired may april authored march html was proposed standard ietf but proposal expired five months later september without further action included many capabilities that were raggett's html+ proposal such support for tables text flow around figures display complex mathematical formulas w3c began development its own arena browser test bed for html cascading style sheets but html did not succeed for several reasons draft was considered very large at pages pace browser development well number interested parties had outstripped resources ietf browser vendors including microsoft netscape at time chose implement different subsets html 3's draft features well introduce their own extensions see browser wars these included extensions control stylistic aspects documents contrary belief that such things text color background texture font size font face were definitely outside scope language when their only intent was specify how document would be organized dave raggett who has been w3c fellow for many years has commented for example certain extent microsoft built its business on web by extending html features january html5 was published working draft link by w3c although its syntax closely resembles that sgml html5 has abandoned any attempt be sgml application has explicitly defined its own html serialization addition alternative xml-based xhtml5 serialization html5 – last call on february w3c extended charter its html working group with clear milestones for html5 may working group advanced html5 last call invitation communities inside outside w3c confirm technical soundness specification w3c developed comprehensive test suite achieve broad interoperability for full specification by which was target date for recommendation january whatwg renamed its html5 living standard html w3c nevertheless continues its project release html5 html5 – candidate recommendation july whatwg w3c decided on degree separation w3c will continue html5 specification work focusing on single definitive standard which considered snapshot by whatwg whatwg organization will continue its work with html5 living standard concept living standard that never complete always being updated improved new features can be added but functionality will not be removed december w3c designated html5 candidate recommendation criterion for advancement w3c recommendation two 100% complete fully interoperable implementations html5 – proposed recommendation recommendation september w3c moved html5 proposed recommendation on october html5 was released stable w3c recommendation meaning specification process complete xhtml versions main article xhtml xhtml separate language that began reformulation html using xml no longer being developed separate standard xhtml published january w3c recommendation later revised republished august offers same three variations html reformulated xml with minor restrictions xhtml published may w3c recommendation based on xhtml strict but includes minor changes can be customized reformulated using modules from modularization xhtml which was published april w3c recommendation xhtml was working draft work on was abandoned favor work on html5 xhtml5 xhtml was incompatible with xhtml 1x therefore would be more accurately characterized xhtml-inspired new language than update xhtml 1x xhtml syntax known xhtml51 being defined alongside html5 html5 draft markup html markup consists several key components including those called tags their attributes character-based data types character references entity references html tags most commonly come pairs like although some represent empty elements so are unpaired for example first tag such pair start tag second end tag they are also called opening tags closing tags another important component html document type declaration which triggers standards mode rendering following example classic hello world program common test employed for comparing programming languages scripting languages markup languages this example made using lines code this title hello world text between describes web page text between visible page content markup text this title defines browser page title document type declaration for html5 if declaration not included various browsers will revert quirks mode for rendering elements main article html element html documents imply structure nested html elements these are indicated document by html tags enclosed angle brackets thus simple general case extent element indicated by pair tags start tag end tag text content element if any placed between these tags tags may also enclose further tag markup between start end including mixture tags text this indicates further nested elements children parent element start tag may also include attributes within tag these indicate other information such identifiers for sections within document identifiers used bind style information presentation document for some tags such used embed images reference image resource some elements such line break do not permit any embedded content either text further tags these require only single empty tag akin start tag do not use end tag many tags particularly closing end tag for very commonly used paragraph element are optional html browser other agent can infer closure for end element from context structural rules defined by html standard these rules are complex not widely understood by most html coders general form html element therefore ''content'' some html elements are defined empty elements take form empty elements may enclose no content for instance tag inline tag name html element name used tags note that end tag's name preceded by slash character / that empty elements end tag neither required nor allowed if attributes are not mentioned default values are used each case element examples header html document title included head for example title headings html headings are defined with tags heading level heading level heading level heading level heading level heading level paragraphs paragraph paragraph line breaks difference between that br breaks line without altering semantic structure page whereas p sections page into paragraphs note also that br empty element that although may have attributes can take no content may not have end tag this paragraph with line breaks this link html create link tag used href= attribute holds url address link link wikipedia comments comments can help understanding markup do not display webpage there are several types markup elements used html structural markup indicates purpose text for example golf establishes golf second-level heading structural markup does not denote any specific rendering but most web browsers have default styles for element formatting content may be further styled using cascading style sheets css presentational markup indicates appearance text regardless its purpose for example boldface indicates that visual output devices should render boldface bold text but gives little indication what devices that are unable do this such aural devices that read text aloud should do case both bold italic there are other elements that may have equivalent visual renderings but that are more semantic nature such strong text emphasised text respectively easier see how aural user agent should interpret latter two elements however they are not equivalent their presentational counterparts would be undesirable for screen-reader emphasize name book for instance but on screen such name would be italicized most presentational markup elements have become deprecated under html specification favor using css for styling hypertext markup makes parts document into links other documents anchor element creates hyperlink document its href attribute sets link's target url for example html markup wikipedia will render word wikipedia hyperlink render image hyperlink img element inserted content into element like br img empty element with attributes but no content closing tag attributes main article html attribute most attributes element are name-value pairs separated by = written within start tag element after element's name value may be enclosed single double quotes although values consisting certain characters can be left unquoted html but not xhtml leaving attribute values unquoted considered unsafe contrast with name-value pair attributes there are some attributes that affect element simply by their presence start tag element like ismap attribute for img element there are several common attributes that may appear many elements id attribute provides document-wide unique identifier for element this used identify element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties scripts may alter animate delete its contents presentation appended url page provides globally unique identifier for element typically sub-section page for example id attributes http//enwikipediaorg/wiki/htmlattributes class attribute provides way classifying similar elements this can be used for semantic presentation purposes for example html document might semantically use designation class=notation indicate that all elements with this class value are subordinate main text document presentation such elements might be gathered together presented footnotes on page instead appearing place where they occur html source class attributes are used semantically microformats multiple class values may be specified for example class=notation important puts element into both notation important classes author may use style attribute assign presentational properties particular element considered better practice use element's id class attributes select element from within stylesheet though sometimes this can be too cumbersome for simple specific ad hoc styling title attribute used attach subtextual explanation element most browsers this attribute displayed tooltip lang attribute identifies natural language element's contents which may be different from that rest document for example english-language document oh well c'est la vie they say france abbreviation element abbr can be used demonstrate some these attributes html this example displays html most browsers pointing cursor at abbreviation should display title text hypertext markup language most elements take language-related attribute dir specify text direction such with rtl for right-to-left text for example arabic persian hebrew character entity references see also list xml html character entity references unicode html version html defines set character entity references set numeric character references both which allow individual characters be written via simple markup rather than literally literal character its markup counterpart are considered equivalent are rendered identically ability escape characters this way allows for characters example html doctype this declaration references dtd for strict version html sgml-based validators read dtd order properly parse document perform validation modern browsers valid doctype activates standards mode opposed quirks mode addition html provides transitional frameset dtds explained below transitional type most inclusive incorporating current tags well older deprecated tags with strict dtd excluding deprecated tags frameset has all tags necessary make frames on page along with tags included transitional type semantic html main article semantic html semantic html way writing html that emphasizes meaning encoded information over its presentation look html has included semantic markup from its inception but has also included presentational markup such tags there are also semantically neutral span div tags since late 1990s when cascading style sheets were beginning work most browsers web authors have been encouraged avoid use presentational html markup with view separation presentation content discussion semantic web tim berners-lee others gave examples ways which intelligent software agents may one day automatically crawl web find filter correlate previously unrelated published facts for benefit human users such agents are not commonplace even now but some ideas web mashups price comparison websites may be coming close main difference between these web application hybrids berners-lee's semantic agents lies fact that current aggregation hybridization information usually designed by web developers who already know web locations api semantics specific data they wish mash compare combine important type web agent that does crawl read web pages automatically without prior knowledge what might find web crawler search-engine spider these software agents are dependent on semantic clarity web pages they find they use various techniques algorithms read index millions web pages day provide web users with search facilities without which world wide web's usefulness would be greatly reduced order for search-engine spiders be able rate significance pieces text they find html documents also for those creating mashups other hybrids well for more automated agents they are developed semantic structures that exist html need be widely uniformly applied bring out meaning published text presentational markup tags are deprecated current html xhtml recommendations are illegal html5 good semantic html also improves accessibility web documents see also web content accessibility guidelines for example when screen reader audio browser can correctly ascertain structure document will not waste visually impaired user's time by reading out repeated irrelevant information when has been marked up correctly delivery html documents can be delivered by same means any other computer file however they are most often delivered either by http from web server by email http main article hypertext transfer protocol world wide web composed primarily html documents transmitted from web servers web browsers using hypertext transfer protocol http however http used serve images sound other content addition html allow web browser know how handle each document receives other information transmitted along with document this meta data usually includes mime type eg text/html application/xhtml+xml character encoding see character encoding html modern browsers mime type that sent with html document may affect how document initially interpreted document sent with xhtml mime type expected be well-formed xml syntax errors may cause browser fail render same document sent with html mime type might be displayed successfully since some browsers are more lenient with html w3c recommendations state that xhtml documents that follow guidelines set forth recommendation's appendix c may be labeled with either mime type xhtml also states that xhtml documents should be labeled with either mime type html e-mail main article html email most graphical email clients allow use subset html often ill-defined provide formatting semantic markup not available with plain text this may include typographic information like coloured headings emphasized quoted text inline images diagrams many such clients include both gui editor for composing html e-mail messages rendering engine for displaying them use html e-mail criticized by some because compatibility issues because can help disguise phishing attacks because accessibility issues for blind visually impaired people because can confuse spam filters because message size larger than plain text naming conventions most common filename extension for files containing html html common abbreviation this htm which originated because some early operating systems file systems such dos limitations imposed by fat data structure limited file extensions three letters html application main article html application html application hta file extension hta microsoft windows application that uses html dynamic html browser provide application's graphical interface regular html file confined security model web browser's security communicating only web servers manipulating only webpage objects site cookies hta runs fully trusted application therefore has more privileges like creation/editing/removal files windows registry entries because they operate outside browser's security model htas cannot be executed via http but must be downloaded just like exe file executed from local file system html4 variations html precisely what we were trying prevent— ever-breaking links links going outward only quotes you can't follow their origins no version management no rights management ted nelson since its inception html its associated protocols gained acceptance relatively quickly however no clear standards existed early years language though its creators originally conceived html semantic language devoid presentation details practical uses pushed many presentational elements attributes into language driven largely by various browser vendors latest standards surrounding html reflect efforts overcome sometimes chaotic development language create rational foundation for building both meaningful well-presented documents return html its role semantic language w3c has developed style languages such css xsl shoulder burden presentation conjunction html specification has slowly reined presentational elements there are two axes differentiating various variations html currently specified sgml-based html versus xml-based html referred xhtml on one axis strict versus transitional loose versus frameset on other axis sgml-based versus xml-based html one difference latest html specifications lies distinction between sgml-based specification xml-based specification xml-based specification usually called xhtml distinguish clearly from more traditional definition however root element name continues be html even xhtml-specified html w3c intended xhtml be identical html except where limitations xml over more complex sgml require workarounds because xhtml html are closely related they are sometimes documented parallel such circumstances some authors conflate two names xhtml xhtml like html xhtml has three sub-specifications strict transitional frameset aside from different opening declarations for document differences between html xhtml document—in each corresponding dtds—are largely syntactic underlying syntax html allows many shortcuts that xhtml does not such elements with optional opening closing tags even empty elements which must not have end tag by contrast xhtml requires all elements have opening tag closing tag xhtml however also introduces new shortcut xhtml tag may be opened closed within same tag by including slash before end tag like this introduction this shorthand which not used sgml declaration for html may confuse earlier software unfamiliar with this new convention fix for this include space before closing tag such understand subtle differences between html xhtml consider transformation valid well-formed xhtml document that adheres appendix c see below into valid html document make this translation requires following steps language for element should be specified with lang attribute rather than xhtml xmllang attribute xhtml uses xml's built language-defining functionality attribute remove xml namespace xmlns=uri html has no facilities for namespaces change document type declaration from xhtml html see dtd section for further explanation if present remove xml declaration typically this ensure that document's mime type set text/html for both html xhtml this comes from http content-type header sent by server change xml empty-element syntax html style empty element those are main changes necessary translate document from xhtml html translate from html xhtml would also require addition any omitted opening closing tags whether coding html xhtml may just be best always include optional tags within html document rather than remembering which tags can be omitted well-formed xhtml document adheres all syntax requirements xml valid document adheres content specification for xhtml which describes document structure w3c recommends several conventions ensure easy migration between html xhtml see html compatibility guidelines following steps can be applied xhtml documents only include both xmllang lang attributes on any elements assigning language use empty-element syntax only for elements specified empty html include extra space empty-element tags for example instead include explicit close tags for elements that permit content but are left empty for example not omit xml declaration by carefully following w3c's compatibility guidelines user agent should be able interpret document equally html xhtml for documents that are xhtml have been made compatible this way w3c permits them be served either html with text/html mime type xhtml with application/xhtml+xml application/xml mime type when delivered xhtml browsers should use xml parser which adheres strictly xml specifications for parsing document's contents transitional versus strict html defined three different versions language strict transitional once called loose frameset strict version intended for new documents considered best practice while transitional frameset versions were developed make easier transition documents that conformed older html specification didn't conform any specification version html transitional frameset versions allow for presentational markup which omitted strict version instead cascading style sheets are encouraged improve presentation html documents because xhtml only defines xml syntax for language defined by html same differences apply xhtml well transitional version allows following parts vocabulary which are not included strict version looser content model o inline elements plain text are allowed directly body blockquote form

above transitional differences frameset specifications whether xhtml html specify different content model with frameset replacing body that contains either frame elements optionally noframes with body summary specification versions this list demonstrates loose versions specification are maintained for legacy support however contrary popular misconceptions move xhtml does not imply removal this legacy support rather x xml stands for extensible w3c modularizing entire specification opening up independent extensions primary achievement move from xhtml xhtml modularization entire specification strict version html deployed xhtml through set modular extensions base xhtml specification likewise someone looking for loose transitional frameset specifications will find similar extended xhtml support much contained legacy frame modules modularization also allows for separate features develop on their own timetable so for example xhtml will allow quicker migration emerging xml standards such mathml presentational semantic math language based on xml xforms—a new highly advanced web-form technology replace existing html forms summary html specification primarily reined all various html implementations into single clearly written specification based on sgml xhtml ported this specification new xml defined specification next xhtml takes advantage extensible nature xml modularizes whole specification xhtml was intended be first step adding new features specification standards-body-based approach html5 variations whatwg html versus html5 main article html5 whatwg considers their work

w3c process both specifications are similar mostly derived from each other ie work on html5 started with older whatwg draft later whatwg living standard was based on html5 drafts hypertext features not html html lacks some features found earlier hypertext systems such source tracking fat links others even some hypertext features that were early versions html have been ignored by most popular web browsers until recently such link element in-browser web page editing sometimes web services browser manufacturers remedy these shortcomings for instance wikis content management systems allow surfers edit web pages they visit wysiwyg editors there are some wysiwyg editors what you see what you get which user lays out everything appear html document using graphical user interface gui often similar word processors editor renders document rather than show code so authors do not require extensive knowledge html wysiwyg editing model has been criticized primarily because low quality generated code there are voices advocating change wysiwym model what you see what you mean wysiwyg editors remain controversial topic because their perceived flaws such relying mainly on layout opposed meaning often using markup that does not convey intended meaning but simply copies layout often producing extremely verbose redundant code that fails make use cascading nature html css often producing ungrammatical
