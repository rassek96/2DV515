backus–naur form function-level programming notable awards national medal science acm turing award harold pender award charles stark draper prize computer history museum fellow john warner backus december – march was american computer scientist he directed team that invented first widely used high-level programming language fortran was inventor backus–naur form bnf widely used notation define formal language syntax he also did research function-level programming helped popularize ieee awarded backus w w mcdowell award for development fortran he received national medal science acm turing award “for profound influential lasting contributions design practical high-level programming systems notably through his work on fortran for publication formal procedures for specification programming languages” contents life career awards honors references external links life career backus was born philadelphia grew up nearby wilmington delaware he studied at hill school pottstown pennsylvania was apparently not diligent student after entering university virginia study chemistry he quit was conscripted into us army he began medical training at haverford college during internship at hospital he was diagnosed with cranial bone tumor which was successfully removed plate was installed his head he ended medical training after nine months subsequent operation replace plate with one his own design after moving new york city he trained initially radio technician became interested mathematics he graduated from columbia university with master's degree mathematics joined ibm during his first three years he worked on selective sequence electronic calculator ssec his first major project was write program calculate positions moon backus developed language speedcoding first high-level language created for ibm computer aid software development for ibm computer programming was very difficult at this time backus assembled team define develop fortran for ibm computer fortran was first high-level programming language be put broad use backus made another critical contribution early computer science during latter part 1950s backus served on international committees that developed algol very influential algol which quickly became de facto worldwide standard for publishing algorithms backus developed backus–naur form bnf unesco report on algol was formal notation able describe any context-free programming language was important development compilers this contribution helped backus win turing award backus normal form was discovered independently by john backus who presented notation which equivalent its power that pāṇini grammarian from india who lived sometime between 4th 7th century bce notation has many similar properties backus later worked on function-level programming language known fp which was described his turing award lecture can programming be liberated from von neumann style sometimes viewed backus's apology for creating fortran this paper did less garner interest fp language than spark research into functional programming general fp interpreter was distributed with 42bsd unix operating system fp was strongly inspired by kenneth e iverson’s apl even using non-standard character set backus spent latter part his career developing fl from function level successor fp fl was internal ibm research project development language essentially stopped when project was finished only few papers documenting remain but many language's innovative arguably important ideas have now been implemented versions j programming language backus was named ibm fellow was awarded degree honoris causa from henri poincaré university nancy france draper prize he retired died at his home ashland oregon on march awards honors named
