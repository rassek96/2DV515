graphic representation great vowel shift showing how pronunciation long vowels gradually shifted with high vowels i u breaking into diphthongs lower vowels each shifting their pronunciation up one level next period history english was early modern english 1500–1700 early modern english was characterised by great vowel shift 1350–1700 inflectional simplification linguistic standardisation great vowel shift affected stressed long vowels middle english was chain shift meaning that each shift triggered subsequent shift vowel system mid open vowels were raised close vowels were broken into diphthongs for example word bite was originally pronounced word beet today second vowel word about was pronounced word boot today great vowel shift explains many irregularities spelling since english retains many spellings from middle english also explains why english vowel letters have very different pronunciations from same letters other languages english began rise prestige during reign henry v

english language which introduced standard set spelling conventions usage norms noah webster published american dictionary english language effort establish norm for speaking writing american english that was independent from british standard within britain non-standard lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised leading quick spread prestige varieties among middle classes terms grammatical evolution modern english has now reached stage where loss case almost complete case now only found pronouns such he him she her who whom where svo word-order mostly fixed some changes such

compounding they are semantically divided into proper nouns names common nouns common nouns are turn divided into concrete abstract nouns grammatically into count nouns mass nouns most count nouns are inflected for plural number through use plural suffix -s but few nouns have irregular plural forms mass nouns can only be pluralised through use count noun classifier eg one loaf bread two loaves bread regular plural formation singular cat dog plural cats dogs irregular plural formation singular man woman foot fish ox knife mouse plural men women feet fish oxen knives mice possession can be expressed either by possessive enclitic -s also traditionally called genitive suffix by preposition historically -s possessive has been used for animate nouns whereas possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns today this distinction less clear many speakers use -s also with inanimates orthographically possessive -s separated from noun root with apostrophe possessive constructions with -s woman's husband's child with child husband woman nouns can form noun phrases nps where they are syntactic head words that depend on them such determiners quantifiers conjunctions adjectives noun phrases can be short such man composed only determiner noun they can also include modifiers such adjectives eg red tall all specifiers such determiners eg that but they can also tie together several

marking superlative small boy boy smaller than girl that boy smallest some adjectives have irregular comparative superlative forms such good better best other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions with adverb more marking comparative most marking superlative happier more happy happiest most happy there some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected periphrastic comparison some studies have shown tendency for periphrastic forms become more common at expense inflected form pronouns case person english pronouns conserve many traits case

introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such y'all found southern american english african american vernacular english youse ye found irish english english personal pronouns person subjective case objective case dependent possessive independent possessive reflexive 1st p sg i me my mine myself 2nd o sg you you your yours yourself 3rd p sg he/she/it him/her/it his/her/its his/hers/its himself/herself/itself 1st p pl we us our ours ourselves 2nd p pl you you your yours yourselves 3rd p pl they them their theirs themselves pronouns are used refer entities deictically anaphorically deictic pronoun points some person object by identifying relative speech situation — for example pronoun i identifies speaker pronoun you addressee anaphorical pronouns such that refer back entity already mentioned assumed by speaker be known by audience for example sentence i already told you that reflexive pronouns are used when oblique argument identical subject phrase eg he sent himself she braced herself for impact prepositions prepositional phrases pp are phrases composed preposition one more nouns eg with dog for my friend school england prepositions have wide range uses english they are used describe movement place other relations between different entities but they also have many syntactic uses such introducing complement clauses oblique arguments verbs for example phrase i gave him preposition marks recipient indirect object verb give traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed case noun they preceded for example causing pronouns use objective rather than subjective form with her me for us but some contemporary grammars such that huddleston & pullum 2002598–600 no longer consider government case be defining feature class prepositions rather defining prepositions words that can function heads prepositional phrases verbs verb phrases english verbs are inflected for tense aspect marked for agreement with third person singular subject only copula verb be still inflected for agreement with plural first second person subjects auxiliary verbs such have be are paired with verbs infinitive past progressive forms they form complex tenses aspects moods auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs that they can be followed by negation that they can occur first constituent question sentence most verbs have six inflectional forms primary forms are plain present third person singular present preterite past form secondary forms are plain form used for infinitive gerund–participle past participle copula verb be only verb retain some its original conjugation takes different inflectional forms depending on subject first person present tense form am third person singular form form are used second person singular all three plurals only verb past participle been its gerund-participle being english inflectional forms inflection strong regular plain present take love 3rd person sg present takes loves preterite took loved plain infinitive take love gerund–participle taking loving past participle taken loved tense aspect mood english has two primary tenses past preterit non-past preterit inflected by using preterit form verb which for regular verbs includes suffix -ed for strong verbs either suffix -t change stem vowel non-past form unmarked except third person singular which takes suffix -s present preterite first person i run i ran third person john runs john ran english does not have morphologised future tense futurity action expressed periphrastically with one auxiliary verbs will shall many varieties also use near future constructed with phrasal verb be going future first person i will run third person john will run further aspectual distinctions are encoded by use auxiliary verbs primarily have be which encode contrast between perfect non-perfect past tense i have run vs i was running compound tenses such preterite perfect i had been running present perfect i have been running for expression mood english uses number modal auxiliaries such can may will shall past tense forms could might would should there also subjunctive imperative mood both based on plain form verb ie without third person singular -s which used subordinate clauses eg subjunctive important that he run every day imperative run infinitive form that uses plain form verb preposition used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate finite verbal clause finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around verb present preterit form clauses with auxiliary verbs they are finite verbs main verb treated subordinate clause for example he has go where only auxiliary verb have inflected for time main verb go infinitive complement clause such i saw him leave where main verb see which preterite form leave infinitive phrasal verbs english also makes frequent use constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs verb phrases that are made up verb root preposition particle which follows verb phrase then functions single predicate terms intonation preposition fused verb but writing written separate word examples phrasal verbs are get up ask out back up give up get together hang out put up with etc phrasal verb frequently has highly idiomatic meaning that more specialised restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from combination verb preposition complement eg lay off meaning terminate someone's employment spite idiomatic meaning some grammarians including huddleston & pullum do not consider this type construction form syntactic constituent hence refrain from using term phrasal verb instead they consider construction simply be verb with prepositional phrase its syntactic complement ie he woke up morning he ran up mountains are syntactically equivalent adverbs function adverbs modify action event described by verb by providing additional information about manner which occurs many adverbs are derived from adjectives with suffix -ly but not all many speakers tend omit suffix most commonly used adverbs for example phrase woman walked quickly adverb quickly derived from adjective quick describes woman's way walking some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms such good which has adverbial form well syntax english sentence cat sat on mat subject cat np verb sat on mat prepositional phrase composed np mat headed by preposition on tree describes structure sentence modern english syntax language moderately analytic has developed features such modal verbs word order resources for conveying meaning auxiliary verbs mark constructions such questions negative polarity passive voice progressive aspect basic constituent order english word order has moved from germanic verb-second v2 word order being almost exclusively subject–verb–object svo combination svo order use auxiliary verbs often creates clusters two more verbs at centre sentence such he had hoped try open most sentences english only marks grammatical relations through word order subject constituent precedes verb object constituent follows example below demonstrates how grammatical roles each constituent marked only by position relative verb dog bites man s v o man bites dog s v o exception found sentences where one constituents pronoun which case doubly marked both by word order by case inflection where subject pronoun precedes verb takes subjective case form object pronoun follows verb takes objective case form example below demonstrates this double marking sentence where both object subject represented with third person singular masculine pronoun he hit him s v o indirect objects io ditransitive verbs can be placed either first object double object construction s v io o such i gave jane book prepositional phrase such i gave book jane clause syntax main article english clause syntax english sentence may be composed one more clauses that may turn be composed one more phrases eg noun phrases verb phrases prepositional phrases clause built around verb includes its constituents such any nps pps within sentence one clause always main clause matrix clause whereas other clauses are subordinate subordinate clauses may function arguments verb main clause for example phrase i think that you are lying main clause headed by verb think subject i but object phrase subordinate clause that you are lying subordinating conjunction that shows that clause that follows subordinate clause but often omitted relative clauses are clauses that function modifier specifier some constituent main clause for example sentence i saw letter that you received today relative clause that you received today specifies meaning word letter object main clause relative clauses can be introduced by pronouns who whose whom which well by that which can also be omitted contrast many other germanic languages there no major differences between word order main subordinate clauses auxiliary verb constructions main articles do-support subject–auxiliary inversion english syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including expression tense aspect mood auxiliary verbs form main clauses main verbs function heads subordinate clause auxiliary verb for example sentence dog did not find its bone clause find its bone complement negated verb did not subject–auxiliary inversion used many constructions including focus negation interrogative constructions verb do can be used auxiliary even simple declarative sentences where usually serves add emphasis i did shut fridge however negated inverted clauses referred above used because rules english syntax permit these constructions only when auxiliary present modern english does not allow addition negating adverb not ordinary finite lexical verb i know not—it can only be added auxiliary copular verb hence if there no other auxiliary present when negation required auxiliary do used produce form like i do not don't know same applies clauses requiring inversion including most questions—inversion must involve subject auxiliary verb so not possible say know you him grammatical rules require do you know him negation done with adverb not which precedes main verb follows auxiliary verb contracted form not -n't can be used enclitic attaching auxiliary verbs copula verb be just with questions many negative constructions require negation occur with do-support thus modern english i don't know him correct answer question do you know him but not i know him not although this construction may be found older english passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs passive construction rephrases active construction such way that object active phrase becomes subject passive phrase subject active phrase either omitted demoted role oblique argument introduced prepositional phrase they are formed by using past participle either with auxiliary verb be get although not all varieties english allow use passives with get for example putting sentence she sees him into passive becomes he seen by her he gets seen by her questions both yes–no questions wh-questions english are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion am i going tomorrow where can we eat which may require do-support do you like her where did he go most cases interrogative words wh-words eg what who where when why how appear fronted position for example question what did you see word what appears first constituent despite being grammatical object sentence when wh-word subject forms part subject no inversion occurs who saw cat prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are question's theme eg whose house did you go last night personal interrogative pronoun who only interrogative pronoun still show inflection for case with variant whom serving objective case form although this form may be going out use many contexts discourse level syntax at discourse level english tends use topic-comment structure where known information topic precedes new information comment because strict svo syntax topic sentence generally has be grammatical subject sentence cases where topic not grammatical subject sentence frequently topic promoted subject position through syntactic means one way doing this through passive construction girl was stung by bee another way through cleft sentence where main clause demoted be complement clause copula sentence with dummy subject such there eg was girl that bee stung there was girl who was stung by bee dummy subjects are also used constructions where there no grammatical subject such with impersonal verbs eg raining existential clauses there are many cars on street through use these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects english able maintain both topic comment sentence structure svo syntax focus constructions emphasise particular piece new salient information within sentence generally through allocating main sentence level stress on focal constituent for example girl was stung by bee emphasising was bee not for example wasp that stung her girl was stung by bee contrasting with another possibility for example that was boy topic focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation either preposing postposing item be focused on relative main clause for example that girl over there she was stung by bee emphasises girl by preposition but similar effect could be achieved by postposition she was stung by bee that girl over there where reference girl established afterthought cohesion between sentences achieved through use deictic pronouns anaphora eg that exactly what i mean where that refers some fact known both interlocutors then used locate time narrated event relative time previously narrated event discourse markers such oh so well also signal progression ideas between sentences help create cohesion discourse markers are often first constituents sentences discourse markers are also used for stance taking which speakers position themselves specific attitude towards what being said for example no way that true idiomatic marker no way expressing disbelief boy i'm hungry marker boy expressing emphasis while discourse markers are particularly characteristic informal spoken registers english they are also used written formal registers vocabulary vocabulary english vast counting exactly how many words english any language has impossible oxford dictionaries suggest that there are at least quarter million distinct english words early studies english vocabulary by lexicographers scholars who formally study vocabulary compile dictionaries both were impeded by lack comprehensive data on actual vocabulary

changes with which orthography has not kept pace compared european languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms english has spelling that less consistent indicator pronunciation standard spellings words that are more difficult guess from knowing how word pronounced there are also systematic spelling differences between british american english these situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform english although letters speech sounds do not have one-to-one correspondence standard english spelling spelling rules that take into account syllable structure phonetic changes derived words word accent are reliable for most english words moreover standard english spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by closer correspondence between pronunciation spelling for example words photograph photography photographic words electricity electrical while few scholars agree with chomsky halle that conventional english orthography near-optimal there rationale for current english spelling patterns standard orthography english most widely used writing system world standard english spelling based
