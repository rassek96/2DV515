boilerplate code from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search computer programming boilerplate code boilerplate refers sections code that have be included many places with little no alteration often used when referring languages that are considered verbose ie programmer must write lot code do minimal jobs need for boilerplate can be reduced through high-level mechanisms such metaprogramming which has computer automatically write needed boilerplate code insert at run time convention over configuration which provides good default values reducing need specify program details every project model-driven engineering which uses models model-to-code generators eliminating need for boilerplate manual code contents origin preamble object-oriented programming html see also origin term arose from newspaper business columns other pieces that were syndicated were sent out subscribing newspapers form mat ie matrix once received boiling lead was poured into this mat create plate used print piece hence name boilerplate article printed on boilerplate could not be altered term came be used by attorneys refer portions contract which did not change through repeated uses different applications finally language general which did not change any document that was used repeatedly for different occasions related term bookkeeping code referring code that not part business logic but interleaved with order keep data structures updated handle secondary aspects program preamble one form boilerplate consists declarations which while not part program logic language's essential syntax are added start source file matter custom following perl example demonstrates boilerplate /usr/bin/perl use warnings use strict first line shebang which identifies file perl script that can be executed directly on command line on unix/linux systems other two are pragmas turning on warnings strict mode which are mandated by fashionable perl programming style this next example c++ programming language boilerplate include guard ifndef myinterfaceh define myinterfaceh endif this sets up checks global flag tell compiler whether file myinterfaceh has already been included many interdepending files may be involved compilation module this avoids processing same header multiple times which would lead errors due multiple definitions with same name object-oriented programming object-oriented programs classes are often provided with methods for getting setting instance variables definitions these methods can frequently be regarded boilerplate although code will vary from one class another sufficiently stereotypical structure that would be better generated automatically than written by hand for example following java class representing pet almost all code boilerplate except for declarations pet name owner public class pet { private string name private person owner public petstring name person owner { thisname = name thisowner = owner } public string getname { return name } public void setnamestring name { thisname = name } public person getowner { return owner } public void setownerperson owner { thisowner = owner } } note that most boilerplate this example exists provide encapsulation if variables name owner were declared public accessor mutator methods would not be needed some other programming languages may be possible achieve same thing with less boilerplate when language has built-in support for such common constructs for example equivalent above java code can be expressed scala using just one line code class petvar name petname var owner person c using automatic properties with compiler generated backing fields public class pet { public string name { get set } public person owner { get set } } html html following boilerplate used basic empty template present most web pages see also directive programming general-purpose macro processor library computer science macro computer science preprocessor snippet programming template
