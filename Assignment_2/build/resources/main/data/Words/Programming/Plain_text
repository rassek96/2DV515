objects images etc may also include limited number characters that control simple arrangement text such line breaks tabulation characters plain text different from formatted text where style information included from binary files which some portions must be interpreted binary objects encoded integers real numbers images etc encoding has traditionally been either ascii sometimes ebcdic unicode-based encodings such utf-8 utf-16 are gradually replacing older ascii derivatives limited bit codes contents plain text rich text plain text unicode definition usage encoding o character encodings o control codes see also references plain text rich text files that contain markup other meta-data are generally considered plain-text long entirety remains directly human-readable form html xml so on coombs renear derose argue punctuation itself markup use plain text rather than bit-streams express markup enables files survive much better wild part by making them largely immune computer architecture incompatibilities according unicode standard plain text pure sequence character codes plain ue-encoded text therefore sequence unicode character codes styled text also known rich text any text representation containing plain text completed by information such language identifier font size color hypertext links for instance rich text such sgml rtf html xml tex relies on plain text wiki technology another such example according unicode standard plain text has two main properties regard rich text plain text underlying content stream which formatting can be applied plain text public standardized universally readable plain text unicode definition plain text represents basic interchangeable content text plain text represents character content only not its appearance can be displayed variety ways requires rendering process make visible with particular appearance if same plain text sequence given disparate rendering processes there no expectation that rendered text each instance should have same appearance instead disparate rendering processes are simply required make text legible according intended reading this legibility criterion constrains range possible appearances relationship between appearance content plain text may be summarized follows plain text must contain enough information permit text be rendered legibly nothing more unicode standard encodes plain text distinction between plain text other forms data same data stream function higher-level protocol not specified by unicode standard itself usage purpose using plain text today primarily independence from programs that require their very own special encoding formatting plain text files can be opened read edited with countless text editors utilities command-line interface allows people give commands plain text get response also plain text many other computer programs are also capable processing creating plain text such countless programs dos windows classic mac os unix its kin well web browsers few browsers such lynx line mode browser produce only plain text for display plain text files are almost universal programming source code file containing instructions programming language almost always plain text file plain text also commonly used for configuration files which are read for saved settings at startup program for much e-mail comment txt file txt record generally contains only plain text without formatting intended for humans read encoding character encodings main article character encoding before early 1960s computers were mainly used for number-crunching rather than for text memory was extremely expensive computers often allocated only bits for each character permitting only characters—assigning codes for a-z a-z 0-9 would leave only codes nowhere near enough most computers opted not support lower-case letters thus early text projects such roberto busa's index thomisticus brown corpus others had resort conventions such keying asterisk preceding letters actually intended be upper-case fred brooks ibm argued strongly for going 8-bit bytes because someday people might want process text won although ibm used ebcdic most text from then on came be encoded ascii using values from for non-printing control characters values from for graphic characters such letters digits punctuation most machines stored characters bits rather than ignoring remaining bit using checksum near-ubiquity ascii was great help but failed address international linguistic concerns dollar-sign $ was not so useful england accented characters used spanish french german many other languages were entirely unavailable ascii not mention characters used greek russian most eastern languages many individuals companies countries defined extra characters needed—often reassigning control characters using value range from using values above conflicts with using 8th bit checksum but checksum usage gradually died out these additional characters were encoded differently different countries making texts impossible decode without figuring out originator's rules for instance browser might display ¬a rather than ` if tried interpret one character set another international organisation for standardisation iso eventually developed several code pages under iso accommodate various languages first these iso 8859-1 also known aslatin-1 covers needs most not all european languages that use latin-based characters there was not quite enough room cover them all iso then provided conventions forswitching between different character sets mid-file many other organisations developed variations on these for many years windows macintosh computers used incompatible variations text-encoding situation became more more complex leading efforts by iso by unicode consortium develop single unified character encoding that could cover all known at least all currently known languages after some conflict these efforts were unified unicode currently allows for code values assigns codes covering nearly all modern text writing systems well many historical ones for many non-linguistic characters such printer's dingbats mathematical symbols etc text considered plain-text regardless its encoding properly understand process recipient must know be able figure out what encoding was used however they need not know anything about computer architecture that was used about binary structures defined by whatever program if any created data control codes main article newline ascii codes before space = = 20h are not intended displayable characters but instead control characters they are used for diverse interpreted meanings for example code null = sometimes denoted ctrl-@ used string end markers programming language c successors most troublesome these are codes lf = line feed = = 0ah cr = carriage return = = 0dh windows os/2 require sequence crlf represent newline while unix relatives use just lf classic mac os but not mac os x uses just code cr this was once slight problem when transferring files between windows unix systems but today most computer programs treat this seamlessly 8-bit character sets such latin-1 other iso sets first characters theupper half are also control codes known thec1 set opposed thec0 set just described however commonplace windows character set called code page assigns printing characters these code points other than this cp1252 same latin-1 not uncommon that web servers identify document being latin-1 when fact code page uses characters c1 set graphics this may may not lead unexpected results
