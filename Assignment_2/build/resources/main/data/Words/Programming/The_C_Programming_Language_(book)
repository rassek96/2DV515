jerry pournelle wrote magazine that year that book still standard bit terse he continued you can learn c language without getting kernighan ritchie but that's doing hard way you're also working too hard if you make only book on c that you buy influence c programming language has often been cited model for technical writing due book's clear presentation concise treatment just pages pages second edition book covers c comprehensively examples generally consist complete programs type one likely encounter daily usage language with emphasis on system programming technical details c are balanced by authors' observations on good programming practice which are immediately illustrated with concrete realistic examples we have tried retain brevity first edition c not big language not well served by big book we have improved exposition critical features such pointers that are central c programming we have refined original examples have added new examples several chapters for instance treatment complicated declarations augmented by programs that convert declarations into words vice versa before all examples have been tested directly from text which machine-readable form — preface second

geared second edition toward programmers rather than compiler writers authors' own words appendix reference manual not standard but our attempt convey essentials standard smaller space meant for easy comprehension by programmers but not definition for compiler writers—that role properly belongs standard itself appendix b summary facilities standard library too meant for reference by programmers not implementers appendix c concise summary changes from original version — preface second edition influence c programming language on programmers generation whom first worked with c universities industry has led many accept authors' programming style conventions recommended practice if not normative practice for example coding formatting style programs presented both editions book often referred k&r style one true brace style significantly became coding style used by convention source code for unix linux kernels see also c++ programming language references b ward terry august
