machine from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search this article about devices that perform tasks for other uses see machine disambiguation further information equipment disambiguation has been suggested that this article be merged with machine mechanical discuss proposed since august james albert bonsack's cigarette rolling machine invented patented machine tool containing one more parts that uses energy perform intended action machines are usually powered by chemical thermal electrical means are often motorized historically power tool also required moving parts classify machine however advent electronics has led development power tools without moving parts that are considered machines simple machine device that simply transforms direction magnitude force but large number more complex machines exist examples include vehicles electronic systems molecular machines computers television radio contents etymology history types o mechanical + simple machines + engines o electrical + electrical machine + electronic machine + computing machines o molecular machines machine elements o mechanisms o controllers impact o industrial revolution o mechanization automation o automata see also references further reading etymology word machine derives from latin word machina which turn derives from greek doric μαχανά makhana ionic μηχανή mekhane contrivance machine engine derivation from μῆχος mekhos means expedient remedy word mechanical comes from same greek roots however ancient greeks probably have borrowed word mekhane from ancient hebrews word mekhonot plural mekhona singular mentioned hebrew bible - torah these mekhonot were ten contraption on four wheels that stood at holy temple jerusalem built by king solomon-2 chronicles ancient greeks were familiar with hebrew scriptures language often borrowed words terms wider meaning fabric structure found classical latin but not greek usage this meaning found late medieval french adopted from french into english mid-16th century 17th century word could also mean scheme plot meaning now expressed by derived machination modern meaning develops out specialized application term stage engines used theater military siege engines both late 16th early 17th centuries oed traces formal modern meaning john harris' lexicon technicum which has machine engine mechanicks whatsoever hath force sufficient either raise stop motion body simple machines are commonly reckoned be six number viz ballance leaver pulley wheel wedge screw compound machines engines are innumerable word engine used near-synonym both by harris later language derives ultimately via old french from latin ingenium ingenuity invention history ] this section needs expansion you can help by adding march flint hand axe found winchester perhaps first example human made device designed manage power hand axe made by chipping flint form wedge wedge simple machine that transforms lateral force movement tool into transverse splitting force movement workpiece idea simple machine originated with greek philosopher archimedes around 3rd century bc who studied archimedean simple machines lever pulley screw he discovered principle mechanical advantage lever later greek philosophers defined classic five simple machines excluding inclined plane were able roughly calculate their mechanical advantage heron alexandria ca 10–75 ad his work mechanics lists five mechanisms that can set load motion lever windlass pulley wedge screw describes their fabrication uses however greeks' understanding was limited statics balance forces did not include dynamics tradeoff between force distance concept work during renaissance dynamics mechanical powers simple machines were called began be studied from standpoint how much useful work they could perform leading eventually new concept mechanical work flemish engineer simon stevin derived mechanical advantage inclined plane was included with other simple machines complete dynamic theory simple machines was worked out by italian scientist galileo galilei le meccaniche on mechanics he was first understand that simple machines do not create energy they merely transform classic rules sliding friction machines were discovered by leonardo da vinci 1452–1519 but remained unpublished his notebooks they were rediscovered by guillaume amontons were further developed by

into simple movable elements led archimedes define lever pulley screw simple machines by time renaissance this list increased include wheel axle wedge inclined plane engines main article engine engine motor machine designed convert energy into useful mechanical motion heat engines including internal combustion engines external combustion engines such steam engines burn fuel create heat which then used create motion electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion pneumatic motors use compressed air others such wind-up toys use elastic energy biological systems molecular motors

logarithms other functions his difference engine can be considered advanced mechanical calculator his analytical engine forerunner modern computer though none were built babbage's lifetime modern computers are electronic ones they use electric charge current magnetization store manipulate information computer architecture deals with detailed design computers there are also simplified models computers like state machine turing machine molecular machines study molecules proteins that are basis biological functions has led concept molecular machine for example current models operation

agriculture manufacturing mining transportation technology had profound effect on social economic cultural conditions times began united kingdom then subsequently spread throughout western europe north america japan eventually rest world starting later part 18th century there began transition parts great britain's previously manual labour draft-animal–based economy towards machine-based manufacturing started with mechanisation textile industries development iron-making techniques increased use refined coal mechanization automation main articles mechanization automation water-powered
