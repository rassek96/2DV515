type theory from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search mathematics logic computer science type theory any class formal systems some which can serve alternatives set theory foundation for all mathematics type theory every term has type operations are restricted terms certain type type theory closely related some cases overlaps with type systems which are programming language feature used reduce bugs types type theory were created avoid paradoxes variety formal logics rewrite systems sometimes type theory used refer this broader application two well-known type theories that can serve mathematical foundations are alonzo church's typed λ-calculus per martin-löf's intuitionistic type theory contents history basic concepts difference from set theory optional features o normalization o dependent types o equality types identity types o inductive types o universe types o computational component systems type theory o major o minor o active practical impact o programming languages o mathematical foundations o proof assistants o linguistics o social sciences relation category theory see also references further reading external links history main article history type theory between bertrand russell proposed various theories type response his discovery that gottlob frege's version naive set theory was afflicted with russell's paradox by russell arrived at ramified theory types together with axiom reducibility both which featured prominently whitehead russell's principia mathematica published between they attempt avoid russell's paradox by first creating hierarchy types then assigning each mathematical possibly other entity type objects given type are built exclusively from objects preceding types those lower hierarchy thus preventing loops 1920s leon chwistek frank p ramsey proposed simpler theory now known theory simple types simple type theory that collapsed complicated hierarchy ramified theory did not require axiom reducibility common usage type theory when those types are used with term rewrite system most famous early example alonzo church's lambda calculus church's theory types helped formal system avoid kleene–rosser paradox that afflicted original untyped lambda calculus church demonstrated that could serve foundation mathematics was referred higher-order logic some other type theories include per martin-löf's intuitionistic type theory which has been foundation used some areas constructive mathematics for proof assistant agda thierry coquand's calculus constructions its derivatives are foundation used by coq others field area active research demonstrated by homotopy type theory basic concepts this article may require cleanup meet wikipedia's quality standards specific problem coding involving math tag may be inaccurate reader interface does not render properly please help improve this article if you can june learn how when remove this template message system type theory each term has type operations are restricted terms certain type typing judgment m {\displaystyle ma} describes that term m {\displaystyle m} has type {\displaystyle a} for example n t {\displaystyle \mathrm {nat} } may be type representing natural numbers {\displaystyle 012} may be inhabitants that type judgement that {\displaystyle 2} has type n t {\displaystyle \mathrm {nat} } written n t {\displaystyle 2\mathrm {nat} } function type theory denoted with arrow → {\displaystyle \to } function d d o n e {\displaystyle \mathrm {addone} } commonly called successor has judgement d d o n e n t → n t {\displaystyle \mathrm {addone} \mathrm {nat} \to \mathrm {nat} } calling applying function argument sometimes written without parentheses so d d o n e {\displaystyle \mathrm {addone} \ 2} instead d d o n e {\displaystyle \mathrm {addone} 2} this may serve more expressive notation for consistent currying type theories also contain rules for rewriting terms these are called conversion rules if rule only works one direction reduction rule for example + {\displaystyle 2+1} {\displaystyle 3} are syntactically different terms but former reduces latter this reduction denoted + ↠ {\displaystyle 2+1\twoheadrightarrow 3} difference from set theory there are many different set theories many different systems type theory so what follows are generalizations set theory built on top logic requires separate system like frege's underneath type theory concepts like can be encoded types type theory itself set theory element can belong multiple sets either subset superset type theory terms generally belong only one type where subset would be used type theory creates new type called dependent sum type with new terms union similarly achieved by new sum type new terms set theory sets can contain unrelated elements eg apples real numbers type theory types that combine unrelated types do so by creating new terms set theory usually encodes numbers sets empty set set containing empty set etc type theory can encode numbers functions using church encoding more naturally inductive types which are types with well-behaved constant terms set theory allows set builder notation type theory has simple connection constructive mathematics through bhk interpretation optional features normalization term + {\displaystyle 2+1} reduces {\displaystyle 3} since {\displaystyle 3} cannot be reduced further called normal form system type theory said be strongly normalizing if all terms have normal form any order reductions reaches weakly normalizing systems have normal form but some orders reductions may loop forever never reach for normalizing system some borrow word element from set theory use refer all closed terms that can reduce same normal form closed term one without parameters term like x + {\displaystyle x+1} with its parameter x {\displaystyle x} called open term thus + {\displaystyle 2+1} + {\displaystyle 3+0} may be different terms but they both form element {\displaystyle 3} similar idea that works for open closed terms convertibility two terms are convertible if there exists term that they both reduce for example + {\displaystyle 2+1} + {\displaystyle 1+2} are convertible are x + + {\displaystyle x+1+1} x + {\displaystyle x+2} however x + {\displaystyle x+1} + x {\displaystyle 1+x} where x {\displaystyle x} free variable are not because both are normal form they are not same confluent weakly normalizing systems can test if two terms are convertible by checking if they both reduce same normal form dependent types main article dependent types dependent type type that depends on term on another type thus type returned by function may depend upon argument function for example list n t {\displaystyle \mathrm {nat} } s length may be different type than list n t {\displaystyle \mathrm {nat} } s length type theory with dependent types possible define function that take parameter n returns list containing n zeros calling function with would produce term with different type than if function was called with dependent types play central role intuitionistic type theory design functional programming languages like idris ats agda epigram equality types identity types many systems type theory have type that represents equality types terms this type different from convertibility often denoted propositional equality intuitionistic type theory equality type known i {\displaystyle i} for identity there type i b {\displaystyle i\ a\ a\ b} when {\displaystyle a} type {\displaystyle a} b {\displaystyle b} are both terms type {\displaystyle a} term type i b {\displaystyle i\ a\ a\ b} interpreted meaning that {\displaystyle a} equal b {\displaystyle b} practice possible build type i n t {\displaystyle i\ \mathrm {nat} \ 3\ 4} but there will not exist term that type intuitionistic type theory new terms equality start with reflexivity if {\displaystyle 3} term type n t {\displaystyle \mathrm {nat} } then there exists term type i n t {\displaystyle i\ \mathrm {nat} \ 3\ 3} more complicated equalities can be created by creating reflexive term then doing reduction on one side so if + {\displaystyle 2+1} term type n t {\displaystyle \mathrm {nat} } then there term type i n t + + {\displaystyle i\ \mathrm {nat} \ 2+1\ 2+1} by reduction generate term type i n t + {\displaystyle i\ \mathrm {nat} \ 2+1\ 3} thus this system equality type denotes that two values same type are convertible by reductions having type for equality important because can be manipulated inside system there usually no judgement say two terms are not equal instead brouwer–heyting–kolmogorov interpretation we map ¬ = b {\displaystyle \neg a=b} = b → ⊥ {\displaystyle a=b\to \bot } where ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } bottom type having no values there exists term with type i n t → ⊥ {\displaystyle i\ \mathrm {nat} \ 3\ 4\to \bot } but not one type i n t → ⊥ {\displaystyle i\ \mathrm {nat} \ 3\ 3\to \bot } homotopy type theory differs from intuitionistic type theory mostly by its handling equality type inductive types main article inductive type system type theory requires some basic terms types operate on some systems build them out functions using church encoding other systems have inductive types set base types set type constructors that generate types with well-behaved properties for example certain recursive functions called on inductive types are guaranteed terminate coinductive type are infinite data types created by giving function that generates next elements see coinduction corecursion induction induction feature for declaring inductive type family types that depends on inductive type induction recursion allows wider range well-behaved types but requires that type recursive functions that operate on them be defined at same time universe types types were created prevent paradoxes such russell's paradox however motives that lead those paradoxes—being able say things about all types—still exist so many type theories have universe type which contains all other types not itself systems where you might want say something about universe types there hierarchy universe types each containing one below hierarchy hierarchy defined being infinite but statements must only refer finite number universe levels type universes are particularly tricky type theory initial proposal intuitionistic type theory suffered from girard's paradox computational component many systems type theory such simply-typed lambda calculus intuitionistic type theory calculus constructions are also programming languages that they are said have computational component computation reduction terms language using rewriting rules system type theory that has well-behaved computational component also has simple connection constructive mathematics through bhk interpretation non-constructive mathematics these systems possible by adding operators on continuations such call with current continuation however these operators tend break desirable properties such canonicity parametricity systems type theory major simply typed lambda calculus which higher-order logic intuitionistic type theory system f lf often used define other type theories calculus constructions its derivatives minor automath st type theory some forms combinatory logic others defined lambda cube others under name typed lambda calculus others under name pure type system active homotopy type theory being researched practical impact programming languages main article type system there extensive overlap interaction between fields type theory type systems type systems are programming language feature designed identify bugs any static program analysis such type checking algorithms semantic analysis phase compiler has connection type theory prime example agda programming language which uses intuitionistic type theory for its type system programming language ml was developed for manipulating type theories see lcf its own type system was heavily influenced by them mathematical foundations ] this section needs expansion you can help by adding may first computer proof assistant called automath used type theory encode mathematics on computer martin-löf specifically developed intuitionistic type theory encode all mathematics serve new foundation for mathematics there current research into mathematical foundations using homotopy type theory mathematicians working category theory already had difficulty working with widely accepted foundation zermelo–fraenkel set theory this led proposals such lawvere's elementary theory category sets etcs homotopy type theory continues this line using type theory researchers are exploring connections between dependent types especially identity type algebraic topology specifically homotopy proof assistants main article proof assistant much current research into type theory driven by proof checkers interactive proof assistants automated theorem provers most these systems use type theory mathematical foundation for encoding proofs which not surprising given close connection between type theory programming languages lf used by twelf often define other type theories multiple type theories falling under higher-order logic are used by hol family provers pvs intuitionistic type theory used by agda which both programming language proof assistant computational type theory used by nuprl calculus constructions its derivatives are used by coq matita multiple type theories are supported by lego isabelle isabelle also supports foundations besides type theories such zfc mizar example proof system that only supports set theory linguistics type theory also widely use formal theories semantics natural languages especially montague grammar its descendants particular categorial grammars pregroup grammars make extensive use type constructors define types noun verb etc words most common construction takes basic types e {\displaystyle e} t {\displaystyle t} for individuals truth-values respectively defines set types recursively follows if {\displaystyle a} b {\displaystyle b} are types then so ⟨ b ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle ab\rangle } nothing except basic types what can be constructed from them by means previous clause are types complex type ⟨ b ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle ab\rangle } type functions from entities type {\displaystyle a} entities type b {\displaystyle b} thus one has types like ⟨ e t ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle et\rangle } which are interpreted elements set functions from entities truth-values ie indicator functions sets entities expression type ⟨ ⟨ e t ⟩ t ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle \langle et\rangle t\rangle } function from sets entities truth-values ie indicator function set sets this latter type standardly taken be type natural language quantifiers like everybody nobody montague barwise cooper social sciences gregory bateson introduced theory logical types into social sciences his notions double bind logical levels are based on russell's theory types relation category theory although initial motivation for category theory was far removed from foundationalism two fields turned out have deep connections john lane bell writes fact categories can themselves be viewed type theories certain kind this fact alone indicates that type theory much more closely related category theory than set theory brief category can be viewed type theory by regarding its objects types sorts ie roughly speaking category may be thought type theory shorn its syntax number significant results follow this way cartesian closed categories correspond typed λ-calculus lambek c-monoids categories with products exponentials single nonterminal object correspond untyped λ-calculus observed independently by lambek dana scott around locally cartesian closed categories correspond martin-löf type theories seely interplay known categorical logic has been subject active research since then see monograph jacobs for instance see also data type for concrete
