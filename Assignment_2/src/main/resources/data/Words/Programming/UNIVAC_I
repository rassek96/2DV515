univac i from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search univac i operator's console univac i at franklin life insurance company univac i universal automatic computer i was first commercial computer produced united states was designed principally by j presper eckert john mauchly inventors eniac design work was started by their company eckert–mauchly computer corporation was completed after company had been acquired by remington rand which later became part sperry now unisys years before successor models univac i appeared machine was simply known univac first univac was accepted by

census bureau's univac for cbs reporter walter cronkite right univac i operator's console closeup univac i was first american computer designed at outset for business administrative use with fast execution relatively simple arithmetic data transport operations opposed complex numerical calculations required scientific computers such univac competed directly against punch-card machines though univac originally could neither read nor punch cards that shortcoming hindered sales companies concerned about high cost manually converting large quantities existing data stored on cards this was corrected by adding offline card processing equipment univac card tape converter univac tape card converter transfer data between cards univac magnetic tapes however early market share univac i was lower than remington rand company wished promote sales company joined with cbs have univac i predict result presidential election univac i predicted eisenhower would have landslide victory over adlai stevenson whom pollsters favored result was greater public awareness computing technology installations first contracts were with government agencies such census bureau us air force us army map service contracts were also signed by acnielsen company prudential insurance company following sale eckert–mauchly computer corporation remington rand due cost overruns on project remington rand convinced nielsen prudential cancel their contracts first sale census bureau was marked with formal ceremony on march at eckert–mauchly division's factory at ridge avenue philadelphia machine was not actually shipped until following december because sole fully set-up model was needed for demonstration purposes company was apprehensive about difficulties dismantling transporting reassembling delicate machine result first installation was with second computer delivered pentagon june univac installations 1951–1954 date customer comments us census bureau suitland md not shipped until us air

sylvania electric new york ny consolidated edison new york ny originally priced at us$159000 univac i rose price until they were between $1250000 $1500000 total systems were eventually built delivered univac i was too expensive for most universities sperry rand unlike companies such ibm was not strong enough financially afford give many away however sperry rand donated univac i systems harvard university university pennsylvania case institute technology cleveland ohio univac i at case was still operable but had been supplanted by univac few univac i systems stayed service long after they were made obsolete by advancing technology census bureau used its two systems until amounting nine years service respectively sperry rand itself used two systems buffalo new york until insurance company life casualty tennessee used its system until totaling over years service technical description this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by

used vacuum tubes weighed pounds metric tons consumed kw could perform about operations per second running on mhz clock central complex alone ie processor memory unit was m by m by m high complete system occupied more than m² ft² floor space main memory details main memory consisted words characters when representing numbers they were written decimal digits plus sign words memory consisted channels 10-word mercury delay line registers input/output buffers were words each consisting channels 10-word mercury delay line registers there are six channels 10-word mercury delay line registers spares with modified circuitry seven more channels control temperature seven mercury tanks one more channel used for word y register total mercury channels contained seven mercury tanks mounted on backs sections mt mv mx nt nv nx gv each mercury tank divided into mercury channels each 10-word mercury delay line channel made up three sections channel column mercury with receiving transmitting quartz piezo-electric crystals mounted at opposite ends intermediate frequency chassis connected receiving crystal containing amplifiers detector compensating delay mounted on shell mercury tank recirculation chassis containing cathode follower pulse former retimer modulator which drives transmitting crystal input clear memory-switch gates mounted sections adjacent mercury tanks instructions data instructions were six alphanumeric characters packed two instructions per word addition time was microseconds multiplication time was microseconds non-standard modification called overdrive did exist that allowed for three four-character instructions per word under some circumstances ingerman's simulator for univac referenced below also makes this modification available internal view univac i digits were represented internally using excess-3 xs3 binary coded decimal bcd arithmetic with six bits per digit using same value digits alphanumeric character set one parity bit per digit for error checking allowing 11-digit signed magnitude numbers but with exception one two machine instructions univac was considered by programmers be decimal machine not binary machine binary representation characters was irrelevant if non-digit character was encountered position during arithmetic operation machine passed unchanged output any carry into non-digit was lost note however that peculiarity univac i's addition/subtraction circuitry was that ignore space minus characters were occasionally treated numeric with values –3 –2 –1 respectively apostrophe ampersand left parenthesis were occasionally treated numeric with values input/output besides operator's console only i/o devices connected univac i were up uniservo tape drives remington standard electric typewriter tektronix oscilloscope uniservo was first commercial computer tape drive commercially sold used data density bits per inch with real transfer rate characters per second on magnetically plated phosphor bronze tapes uniservo could also read write unityper created tapes at bits per inch unityper was offline typewriter tape device used by programmers for minor data editing backward forward tape read write operations were possible on univac were fully overlapped with instruction execution permitting high system throughput typical sort/merge data processing applications large volumes data could be inputted via magnetic tapes created on offline card tape system outputted via separate offline tape printer system operators console had three columns decimal coded switches that allowed any memory locations be displayed on oscilloscope since mercury delay line memory stored bits serial format programmer operator could monitor any memory location continuously with sufficient patience decode its contents displayed on scope on-line typewriter was typically used for announcing program breakpoints checkpoints for memory dumps typical univac i installation had several ancillary devices there were typically printer that read magnetic tape printed output on continuous-form paper card-to-tape converter that read punched cards recorded their images on magnetic tape tape-to-card converter that read magnetic tape produced punched cards see also wikimedia commons has media related univac i list univac products history computing hardware list vacuum tube computers ferranti mark grace hopper notes
