type safety from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search type systems general concepts type safety major categories static vs dynamic manifest vs inferred nominal vs structural duck typing minor categories dependent flow-sensitive gradual latent substructural unique see also strong weak typing computer science type safety extent which programming language discourages prevents type errors type error erroneous undesirable program behaviour caused by discrepancy between differing data types for program's constants variables methods functions eg treating integer int floating-point number float type safety sometimes alternatively considered be property computer program rather than language which that program written that some languages have type-safe facilities that can be circumvented by programmers who adopt practices that exhibit poor type safety formal type-theoretic definition type safety considerably stronger than what understood by most programmers type enforcement can be static catching potential errors at compile time dynamic associating type information with values at run-time consulting them needed detect imminent errors combination both behaviors classified type errors by given programming language are usually those that result from attempts perform operations on values that are not appropriate data type this classification partly based on opinion may imply that any operation not leading program crashes security flaws other obvious failures legitimate need not be considered error may imply that any contravention programmer's explicit intent communicated via typing annotations be erroneous not type-safe context static compile-time type systems type safety usually involves among other things guarantee that eventual value any expression will be legitimate member that expression's static type precise requirement more subtle than this — see for example subtype polymorphism for complications type safety closely linked memory safety restriction on ability copy arbitrary bit patterns from one memory location another for instance implementation language that has some type t {\displaystyle t} such that some sequence bits appropriate length does not represent legitimate member t {\displaystyle t} if that language allows data be copied into variable type t {\displaystyle t} then not type-safe because such operation might assign non- t {\displaystyle t} value that variable conversely if language type-unsafe extent allowing arbitrary integer be used pointer then not memory-safe most statically typed languages provide degree type safety that strictly stronger than memory safety because their type systems enforce proper use abstract data types defined by programmers even when this not strictly necessary for

only memory locations authorized access for this discussion type safety specifically refers memory type safety should not be confused with type safety broader respect for example type-safe code cannot read values from another object's private fields robin milner provided following slogan describe type safety well-typed programs cannot go wrong appropriate formalization this slogan depends on style formal semantics used for particular language context denotational semantics type safety means that value expression that well-typed say with type τ bona fide member set corresponding τ andrew wright matthias felleisen formulated what now standard definition proof technique for type safety languages defined by operational semantics under this approach type safety determined by two properties semantics programming language type- preservation subject reduction well typedness programs remains invariant under transition rules ie evaluation rules reduction rules language progress well typed program never gets stuck ie never gets into undefined state where no further transitions are possible these properties do not exist vacuum they are linked semantics programming language they describe there large space varied languages that can fit these criteria since notion well typed program part static semantics programming language notion getting stuck going wrong property its dynamic semantics vijay saraswat provides following definition language type-safe if only operations that can be performed on data language are those sanctioned by type data relation other forms safety type safety ultimately aimed at excluding other problems eg- prevention illegal operations for example we can identify expression / hello world invalid because rules arithmetic do not specify how divide integer by string memory safety o wild pointers can arise when pointer one type object treated pointer another type for instance size object depends on type so if pointer incremented under wrong credentials will end up pointing at some random area memory o buffer overflow - out-of bound writes can corrupt contents objects already present on heap this can occur when larger object one type crudely copied into smaller object another type logic errors originating semantics different types for instance inches millimeters may both be stored integers but should not be substituted for each other added type system can enforce two different types integer for them type-safe type-unsafe languages type safety usually requirement for any toy language proposed academic programming language research many languages on other hand are too big for human-generated type safety proofs they often require checking thousands cases nevertheless some languages such standard ml which has rigorously defined semantics have been proved meet one definition type safety some other languages such haskell are believed meet some definition type safety provided certain escape features are not used for example haskell's unsafeperformio used escape from usual restricted environment which i/o possible circumvents type system so can be used break type safety type punning another example such escape feature regardless properties language definition certain errors may occur at run-time due bugs implementation linked libraries written other languages such errors could render given implementation type unsafe certain circumstances early version sun's java virtual machine was vulnerable this sort problem type safety strong typing some people use term strong typing refer certain aspects type safety for example language with statically checked type system may be described strongly typed because statically disallows conversions between values incompatible type similarly language with dynamically checked type system may also be described strongly typed because program which tries convert value incompatible type will fail at runtime type safety object oriented languages object oriented languages type safety usually intrinsic fact type system place this expressed terms class definitions class essentially defines structure objects derived from api contract for handling these objects each time new object created will comply with that contract each function that exchanges objects derived from specific class implementing specific interface will adhere that contract hence that function operations permitted on that object will be only those defined by methods class object implements this will guarantee that object integrity will be preserved exception this are object oriented languages that allow dynamic modification object structure use reflection modify content object overcome constraints imposed by class methods definitions type safety issues specific languages ada wikibook ada programming has page on topic type system ada was designed be suitable for embedded systems device drivers other forms system programming but also encourage type safe programming resolve these conflicting goals ada confines type-unsafety certain set special constructs whose names usually begin with string unchecked uncheckeddeallocation can be effectively banned from unit ada text by applying pragma pure this unit expected that programmers will use unchecked constructs very carefully only when necessary programs that do not use them are type safe spark programming language subset ada eliminating all its potential ambiguities insecurities while at same time adding statically checked contracts language features available spark avoids issues with dangling pointers by disallowing allocation at run time entirely ada2012 adds statically checked contracts language itself form pre- post-conditions well type invariants c wikibooks has book on topic c programming c programming language typesafe limited contexts for example compile-time error generated when attempt made convert pointer one type structure pointer another type structure unless explicit cast used however number very common operations are non-typesafe for example usual way print integer something like printf%d where %d tells printf at run-time expect integer argument something like printf%s which erroneously tells function expect pointer character-string may be accepted by compilers but will produce undefined results this partially mitigated by some compilers such gcc checking type correspondences between printf arguments format strings addition c like ada provides unspecified undefined explicit conversions unlike ada idioms that use these conversions are very common have helped give c type-unsafe reputation for example standard way allocate memory on heap invoke memory allocation function such malloc with argument indicating how many bytes are required function returns untyped pointer type void which calling code must explicitly implicitly cast appropriate pointer type pre-standardized implementations c required explicit cast do so therefore code struct foo mallocsizeofstruct foo became accepted practice however this practice discouraged iso c can mask failure include header file which malloc defined resulting downstream errors on machines where int pointer types are different sizes such most common implementations c for now-ubiquitous x86 architecture conflict arises code that required compile c++ since cast necessary that language c++ some features c++ that promote more type-safe code new operator returns pointer type based on operand whereas malloc returns void pointer c++ code can use virtual functions templates achieve polymorphism without void pointers preprocessor constants without type can be rewritten const variables typed preprocessor macro functions without type can be rewritten inline functions typed flexibility accepting returning different types can still be obtained by function overloading safer casting operators such dynamic cast that performs run-time type checking c c type-safe but not statically type-safe has support for untyped pointers but this must be accessed using unsafe keyword which can be prohibited at compiler level has inherent support for run-time cast validation casts can be validated by using keyword that will return null reference if cast invalid by using c-style cast that will throw exception if cast invalid see c sharp conversion operators undue reliance on object type from which all other types are derived runs risk defeating purpose c type system usually better practice abandon object references favour generics similar templates c++ generics java java wikibooks has book on topic java programming java language designed enforce type safety anything java happens inside object each object instance class implement type safety enforcement each object before usage needs be allocated java allows usage primitive types but only inside properly allocated objects sometimes part type safety implemented indirectly eg class bigdecimal represents floating point number arbitrary precision but handles only numbers that can be expressed with finite representation operation bigdecimaldivide calculates new object division two numbers expressed bigdecimal this case if division has no finite representation when one computes eg 1/3=033333 divide method can raise exception if no rounding mode defined for operation hence library rather than language guarantees that object respects contract implicit class definition standard ml wikibooks has book on topic standard ml programming sml has rigorously defined semantics known be type-safe however some implementations sml including standard ml new jersey sml/nj its syntactic variant mythryl mlton provide libraries that offer certain unsafe operations these facilities are often used conjunction with those implementations' foreign function interfaces interact with non-ml code such c libraries that may require data laid out specific ways another example sml/nj interactive toplevel itself which must use unsafe operations execute ml code entered by user modula-2 modula-2 strongly typed language with design philosophy require any unsafe facilities be explicitly marked unsafe this achieved by moving such facilities into built-in pseudo-library called system from where they must be imported before they can be used import thus makes visible when such facilities are used unfortunately this was not consequently implemented original language report its implementation there still remained unsafe facilities such type cast syntax variant records inherited from pascal that could be used without prior import difficulty moving these facilities into system pseudo-module was lack any identifier for facility that could then be imported since only identifiers can be imported but not syntax import system allows use certain unsafe facilities var word systemword addr systemaddress addr = systemadrword but type cast syntax can be used without such import var i integer n cardinal n = cardinali i = integern iso modula-2 standard corrected this for type cast facility by changing type cast syntax into function called cast which has be imported from pseudo-module system however other unsafe facilities such variant records remained available without any import from pseudo-module system import system var i integer n cardinal i = systemcastinteger n type cast iso modula-2 recent revision language applied original design philosophy rigorously first pseudo-module system was renamed unsafe make unsafe nature facilities imported from there more explicit then all remaining unsafe facilities where either removed altogether for example variant records moved pseudo-module unsafe for facilities where there no identifier that could be imported enabling identifiers were introduced order enable such facility its corresponding enabling identifier must be imported from pseudo-module unsafe no unsafe facilities remain language that do not require import from unsafe import unsafe var i integer n cardinal i = unsafecastinteger n type cast modula-2 revision from unsafe import ffi enabling identifier for foreign function interface facility pragma for foreign function interface c pascal wikibooks has book on topic pascal programming pascal has had number type safety requirements some which are kept some compilers where pascal compiler dictates strict typing two variables cannot be assigned each other unless they are either compatible such conversion integer real assigned identical subtype for example if you have following code fragment type twotypes = record i integer q real end dualtypes = record i integer q real end var t1 t2 twotypes d1 d2 dualtypes under strict typing variable defined twotypes not compatible with dualtypes because they are not identical even though components that user defined type are identical assignment t1 = d2 illegal assignment t1 = t2 would be legal because subtypes they are defined are identical however assignment such t1q = d1q would be legal common lisp general common lisp type-safe language common lisp compiler responsible for inserting dynamic checks for operations whose type safety cannot be proven statically however programmer may indicate that program should be compiled with lower level dynamic type-checking program compiled such mode cannot be considered type-safe c++ examples following examples illustrates how c++ cast operators can break type safety when used incorrectly first example shows how basic data types can be incorrectly casted include using namespace std int main { int ival = // integer value float fval = reinterpretcastival // reinterpret bit pattern cout using namespace std class parent { public virtual ~parent {} // virtual destructor for rtti } class child1 public parent { public int } class child2 public parent { public float b } int main { child1 c1 c1a = parent & p = c1 // upcast always safe child2 & c2 = staticcastp // invalid downcast cout retrieved standard ml smlnjorg retrieved on systemiounsafe ghc
