see java se not be confused with javascript java paradigm multi-paradigm object-oriented class-based structured imperative generic reflective concurrent designed by james gosling developer sun microsystems now owned by oracle corporation first appeared may years ago typing discipline static strong safe nominative manifest license gnu general public license java community process filename

wikibooks java general-purpose computer programming language that concurrent class-based object-oriented specifically designed have few implementation dependencies possible intended let application developers write once run anywhere wora meaning that compiled java code can run on all platforms that support java without need for recompilation java applications are typically compiled bytecode that can run on any java virtual machine jvm regardless computer architecture java one most popular programming languages use particularly for client-server web applications with reported million developers java was originally developed by james gosling at sun microsystems which has since been acquired by oracle corporation released core component sun microsystems' java platform language derives much its syntax from c c++ but has fewer low-level facilities than either them original reference implementation java compilers virtual machines class libraries were originally released by sun under proprietary licences may compliance with specifications java community process sun relicensed most its java technologies under gnu general public license others have also developed alternative implementations these sun technologies such gnu compiler for java bytecode compiler gnu classpath standard libraries icedtea -web browser plugin for applets latest version java which only version

james gosling mike sheridan patrick naughton initiated java language project june java was originally designed for interactive television but was too advanced for digital cable television industry at time language was initially called oak after oak tree that stood outside gosling's office later project went by name green was finally renamed java from java coffee gosling designed java with c/c++-style syntax that system application programmers would find familiar sun microsystems released first public implementation java promised write once run anywhere wora providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms fairly secure featuring configurable security allowed network- file-access restrictions major web browsers soon incorporated ability run java applets within web pages java quickly became popular while mostly outside browsers that wasn't original plan january oracle announced that java runtime environments based on jdk will discontinue browser plugin java compiler was re-written java by arthur van hoff comply strictly with java language specification with advent java released initially j2se december – new versions had multiple configurations built for different types platforms j2ee included technologies apis for enterprise applications typically run server environments while j2me featured apis optimized for mobile applications desktop version was renamed j2se for marketing purposes sun renamed new j2 versions java ee java me java se respectively sun microsystems approached iso/iec jtc standards body later ecma international formalize java but soon withdrew from process java remains de facto standard controlled through java community process at one time sun made most its java implementations available without charge despite their proprietary software status sun generated revenue from java through selling licenses for specialized products such java enterprise system on november sun released much its java virtual machine jvm free open-source software foss under terms gnu general public license gpl on may sun finished process making all its jvm's core code available under free software /open-source distribution terms aside from small portion code which sun did not hold copyright sun's vice-president rich green said that sun's ideal role with regard java was evangelist following oracle corporation's acquisition sun microsystems 2009–10 oracle has described itself steward java technology with relentless commitment fostering community participation transparency this did not prevent oracle from filing lawsuit against google shortly after that for using java inside android sdk see google section below java software runs on everything from laptops data centers game consoles scientific supercomputers on april james gosling resigned from oracle principles there were five primary goals creation java language must be simple object-oriented familiar must be robust secure must be architecture-neutral portable must execute with high performance must be interpreted threaded dynamic versions main article java version history only java supported publicly major release versions java along with their release dates jdk january jdk february j2se december j2se may j2se february j2se september java se december java se july java se march practices java platform main articles java software platform java virtual machine java control panel version one design goal java portability which means that programs written for java platform must run similarly on any combination hardware operating system with adequate runtime support this achieved by compiling java language code intermediate representation called java bytecode instead directly architecture-specific machine code java bytecode instructions are analogous machine code but they are intended be executed by virtual machine vm written specifically for host hardware end users commonly use java runtime environment jre installed on their own machine for standalone java applications web browser for java applets standard libraries provide generic way access host-specific features such graphics threading networking use universal bytecode makes porting simple however overhead interpreting bytecode into machine instructions makes interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native executables however just-in-time jit compilers that compile bytecodes machine code during runtime were introduced from early stage java itself platform-independent adapted particular platform run on by java virtual machine for which translates java bytecode into platform's machine language implementations see also free java implementations oracle corporation current owner official implementation java se platform following their acquisition sun microsystems on january this implementation based on original implementation java by sun oracle implementation available for microsoft windows still works for xp while only later versions currently publicly supported mac os x linux solaris because java lacks any formal standardization recognized by ecma international iso/iec ansi other third-party standards organization oracle implementation de facto standard oracle implementation packaged into two different distributions java runtime environment jre which contains parts java se platform required run java programs intended for end users java development kit jdk which intended for software developers includes development tools such java compiler javadoc jar debugger openjdk another notable java se implementation that licensed under gnu gpl implementation started when sun began releasing java source code under gpl java se openjdk official java reference implementation goal java make all implementations java compatible historically sun's trademark license for usage java brand insists that all implementations be compatible this resulted legal dispute with microsoft after sun claimed that microsoft implementation did not support rmi jni had added platform-specific features their own sun sued won settlement us$20 million well court order enforcing terms license from sun result microsoft no longer ships java with windows platform-independent java essential java ee even more rigorous validation required certify implementation this environment enables portable server-side applications performance main article java performance programs written java have reputation for being slower requiring more memory than those written c++ however java programs' execution speed improved significantly with introduction just-in-time compilation 1997/1998 for java addition language features supporting better code analysis such inner classes stringbuilder class optional assertions etc optimizations java virtual machine such hotspot becoming default for sun's jvm with java performance was improved with addition javautilconcurrent package including lock free implementations concurrentmaps other multi-core collections was improved further java some platforms offer direct hardware support for java there are microcontrollers that can run java hardware instead software java virtual machine arm based processors can have hardware support for executing java bytecode through their jazelle option while its support mostly dropped current implementations arm automatic memory management java uses automatic garbage collector manage memory object lifecycle programmer determines when objects are created java runtime responsible for recovering memory once objects are no longer use once no references object remain unreachable memory becomes eligible be freed automatically by garbage collector something similar memory leak may still occur if programmer's code holds reference object that no longer needed typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored containers that are still use if methods for nonexistent object are called null pointer exception thrown one ideas behind java's automatic memory management model that programmers can be spared burden having perform manual memory management some languages memory for creation objects implicitly allocated on stack explicitly allocated deallocated from heap latter case responsibility managing memory resides with programmer if program does not deallocate object memory leak occurs if program attempts access deallocate memory that has already been deallocated result undefined difficult predict program likely become unstable and/or crash this can be partially remedied by use smart pointers but these add overhead complexity note that garbage collection does not prevent logical memory leaks ie those where memory still referenced but never used garbage collection may happen at any time ideally will occur when program idle guaranteed be triggered if there insufficient free memory on heap allocate new object this can cause program stall momentarily explicit memory management not possible java java does not support c/c++ style pointer arithmetic where object addresses unsigned integers usually long integers can be used interchangeably this allows garbage collector relocate referenced objects ensures type safety security c++ some other object-oriented languages variables java's primitive data types are either stored directly fields for objects on stack for methods rather than on heap commonly true for non-primitive data types but see escape analysis this was conscious decision by java's designers for performance reasons java contains multiple types garbage collectors by default hotspot uses parallel scavenge garbage collector however there are also several other garbage collectors that can be used manage heap for 90% applications java concurrent mark-sweep cms garbage collector sufficient oracle aims replace cms with garbage-first collector g1 syntax main article java syntax syntax java largely influenced by c++ unlike c++ which combines syntax for structured generic object-oriented programming java was built almost exclusively object-oriented language all code written inside classes every data item object with exception primitive data types ie integers floating-point numbers boolean values characters which are not objects for performance reasons java reuses some popular aspects c++ such printf method unlike c++ java does not support operator overloading multiple inheritance for classes though multiple inheritance supported for interfaces this simplifies language aids preventing potential errors anti-pattern design java uses comments similar those c++ there are three different styles comments single line style marked with two slashes // multiple line style opened with / closed with / javadoc commenting style opened with / closed with / javadoc style commenting allows user run javadoc executable create documentation for program example // this example single line comment using two slashes / this example multiple line comment using slash asterisk this type comment can be used hold lot information deactivate code but very important remember close comment / package fibsandlies import javautilhashmap / this example javadoc comment javadoc can compile documentation from this text javadoc comments must immediately precede class method field being documented / public class fibcalculator extends fibonacci implements calculator { private static map memoized = new hashmap / main method written follows used by jvm starting point for program / public static void mainstring args { memoizedput1 memoizedput2 systemoutprintlnfibonacci12 //get 12th fibonacci number print console } / example method written java wrapped class given non-negative number fibindex returns nth fibonacci number where n equals fibindex @param fibindex index fibonacci number @return fibonacci number / public static int fibonacciint fibindex { if memoizedcontainskeyfibindex { return memoizedgetfibindex } else { int answer = fibonaccifibindex - + fibonaccifibindex - memoizedputfibindex answer return answer } } } examples hello world program traditional hello world program can be written java class helloworldapp { public static void mainstring args { systemoutprintlnhello world // prints string console } } source files must be named after public class they contain appending suffix java for example helloworldappjava must first be compiled into bytecode using java compiler producing file named helloworldappclass only then can be executed launched java source file may only contain one public class but can contain multiple classes with other than public access any number public inner classes when source file contains multiple classes make one class public name source file with that public class name class that not declared public may be stored any java file compiler will generate class file for each class defined source file name class file name class with class appended for class file generation anonymous classes are treated if their name were concatenation name their enclosing class $ integer keyword public denotes that method can be called from code other classes that class may be used by classes outside class hierarchy class hierarchy related name directory which java file located this called access level modifier other access level modifiers include keywords private protected keyword static front method indicates static method which associated only with class not with any specific instance that class only static methods can be invoked without reference object static methods cannot access any class members that are not also static methods that are not designated static are instance methods require specific instance class operate keyword void indicates that main method does not return any value caller if java program exit with error code must call systemexit explicitly method name main not keyword java language simply name method java launcher calls pass control program java classes that run managed environments such applets enterprise javabeans do not use need main method java program may contain multiple classes that have main methods which means that vm needs be explicitly told which class launch from main method must accept array string objects by convention referenced args although any other legal identifier name can be used since java main method can also use variable arguments form public static void mainstring args allowing main method be invoked with arbitrary number string arguments effect this alternate declaration semantically identical args parameter still array string objects but allows alternative syntax for creating passing array java launcher launches java by loading given class specified on command line attribute jar starting its public static void mainstring method stand-alone programs must declare this method explicitly string args parameter array string objects containing any arguments passed class parameters main are often passed by means command line printing part java standard library system class defines public static field called out out object instance printstream class provides many methods for printing data standard out including printlnstring which also appends new

applet applets may also be embedded html using either object embed element although support for these elements by web browsers inconsistent however applet tag deprecated so object tag preferred where supported host application typically web browser instantiates hello applet creates appletcontext for applet once applet has initialized itself added awt display hierarchy paintcomponent method called by awt event dispatching thread whenever display needs applet draw itself servlet main article java servlet java servlet technology provides web developers with simple consistent mechanism for extending functionality web server for accessing existing business systems servlets are server-side java ee components that generate responses typically html pages requests typically http requests from clients servlet can almost be thought applet that runs on server side—without face // hellojava import javaio import javaxservlet public class hello extends genericservlet { public void

pages jsp are server-side java ee components that generate responses typically html pages http requests from clients jsps embed java code html page by using special delimiters jsp compiled java servlet java application its own right first time accessed after that generated servlet creates response swing application main article swing java swing graphical user interface library for java se platform possible specify different look feel through pluggable look feel system swing clones windows gtk+ motif are supplied by sun apple also provides aqua look feel for mac os x where prior implementations these looks feels may have been considered lacking swing java se addresses this problem by using more native gui widget drawing routines underlying platforms this example swing application creates single window with hello world inside // hellojava java se import javaxswing public class hello extends jframe { public hello { superhello

public classes interfaces from javaxswing package hello class extends jframe class jframe class implements window with title bar close control hello constructor initializes frame by first calling superclass constructor passing parameter hello which used window's title then calls setdefaultcloseoperationint method inherited from jframe set default operation when close control on title bar selected windowconstantsexitonclose – this causes jframe be disposed when frame closed opposed merely hidden which allows java virtual machine exit program terminate next jlabel created for string hello world addcomponent method inherited from container superclass called add label frame pack method inherited from window superclass called size window lay out its contents main method called by java virtual machine when program starts instantiates new hello frame causes be displayed by calling setvisibleboolean method inherited from component superclass with boolean parameter true once frame displayed exiting main method does not cause program terminate because awt event dispatching thread remains active until all swing top-level windows have been disposed generics main article generics java generics were added java language part j2se prior introduction generics each variable declaration had be specific type for container classes for example this problem because there no easy way create container that accepts only specific types objects either container operates on all subtypes class interface usually object different container class has be created for each contained class generics allow compile-time type checking without having create many container classes each containing almost identical code addition enabling more efficient code certain runtime exceptions are converted compile-time errors characteristic known type safety criticism main article criticism java criticisms directed at java include implementation generics speed handling unsigned numbers
