programming language developed by mathworks matlab allows matrix manipulations plotting functions data implementation algorithms creation user interfaces interfacing with programs written other languages including c c++ c java fortran python although matlab intended primarily for numerical computing optional toolbox uses mupad symbolic engine allowing access symbolic computing abilities additional package simulink adds graphical multi-domain simulation model-based design for dynamic embedded systems matlab had around one million users across industry academia matlab users come from various backgrounds engineering science economics contents history syntax o variables o vectors matrices o structures o functions o function handles o classes object-oriented programming graphics

notes references external links history cleve moler chairman computer science department at university new mexico started developing matlab late 1970s he designed give his students access linpack eispack without them having learn fortran soon spread other universities found strong audience within applied mathematics community jack little engineer was exposed during visit moler made stanford university recognizing its commercial potential he joined with moler steve bangert they rewrote matlab c founded mathworks continue its development these rewritten libraries were known jackpac matlab was rewritten use newer set libraries for matrix manipulation lapack matlab was first adopted by researchers practitioners control engineering little's specialty but quickly spread many other domains now also used education particular teaching linear algebra numerical analysis popular amongst scientists involved image processing syntax matlab application built around matlab scripting language common usage matlab application involves using command window interactive mathematical shell executing text files containing matlab code variables variables are defined using assignment operator = matlab weakly typed programming language because types are implicitly converted inferred typed language because variables can be assigned without declaring their type except if they are be treated symbolic objects that their type can change values can come from constants from computation involving values other variables from output function for example >> x = x = >> x = 'hat' x = hat >> y = x + y = >> x = x = >> y = 3sinx y = vectors matrices simple array defined using colon syntax initincrement terminator for instance >> array = array = defines variable named array assigns new value existing variable with name array which array consisting values that array starts at init value increments with each step from previous value by increment value stops once reaches avoid exceeding terminator value >> array = array = increment value can actually be left out this syntax along with one colons use default value >> ari = ari = assigns variable named ari array with values since default value used incrementer indexing one-based which usual convention for matrices mathematics although not for some programming languages such c c++ java matrices can be defined by separating elements row with blank space comma using semicolon terminate each row list elements should be surrounded by square brackets parentheses are used access elements subarrays they are also used denote function argument list >> = = >> a23 ans = sets indices can be specified by expressions such which evaluates for example submatrix taken from rows through columns through can be written >> a2434 ans = square identity matrix size n can be generated using function eye matrices any size with zeros ones can be generated with functions zeros ones respectively >> eye33 ans = >> zeros23 ans = >> ones23 ans = most matlab functions can accept matrices will apply themselves each element for example mod2jn will multiply every element j by then reduce each element modulo n matlab does include standard for while loops but other similar applications such r using vectorized notation often produces code that faster execute this code excerpted from function magicm creates magic square m for odd values n matlab function meshgrid used here generate square matrices i j containing 1n = meshgrid1n = modi + j - n + / n b = modi + j - n m = n + b + structures matlab has structure data types since all variables matlab are arrays more adequate name structure array where each element array has same field names addition matlab supports dynamic field names field look-ups by name field manipulations etc unfortunately matlab jit does not support matlab structures therefore just simple bundling various variables into structure will come at cost functions when creating matlab function name file should match name first function file valid function names begin with alphabetic character can contain letters numbers underscores functions are also often case sensitive function handles matlab supports elements lambda calculus by introducing function handles function references which are implemented either m files anonymous/nested functions classes object-oriented programming matlab supports object-oriented programming including classes inheritance virtual dispatch packages pass-by-value semantics pass-by-reference semantics however syntax calling conventions are significantly different from other languages matlab has value classes reference classes depending on whether class has handle super-class for reference classes not for value classes method call behavior different between value reference classes for example call method objectmethod can alter any member object only if object instance reference class example simple class provided below classdef hello methods function greetthis disp'hello' end end end when put into file named hellom this can be executed with following commands >> x = hello >> xgreet hello graphics graphical user interface programming matlab supports developing applications with graphical user interface gui features matlab includes guide gui development environment for graphically designing guis also has tightly integrated graph-plotting features for example function plot can be used produce graph from two vectors x y code x = 0pi/1002pi y = sinx plotxy produces following figure sine function matlab program can produce three-dimensional graphics using functions surf plot3 mesh = meshgrid-1002510-1002510 f = sincsqrtx/pi^2+y/pi^2 meshxyf axis xlabel'{\bfx}' ylabel'{\bfy}' zlabel'{\bfsinc} {\bfr}' hidden off = meshgrid-1002510-1002510 f = sincsqrtx/pi^2+y/pi^2 surfxyf axis xlabel'{\bfx}' ylabel'{\bfy}' zlabel'{\bfsinc} {\bfr}' this code produces wireframe plot two-dimensional unnormalized sinc function this code produces surface plot two-dimensional unnormalized sinc function matlab graphical user interfaces can be programmed with gui design environment guide tool interfacing with other languages matlab can call functions subroutines written programming languages c fortran wrapper function created allowing matlab data types be passed returned dynamically loadable object files created by compiling such functions are termed mex-files for matlab ex ecutable since increasing two-way interfacing with python being added libraries written perl java activex net can be directly called from matlab many matlab libraries for example xml sql support are implemented wrappers around java activex libraries calling matlab from java more complicated but can be done with matlab toolbox which sold separately by mathworks using undocumented mechanism called jmi java-to-matlab interface which should not be confused with unrelated java metadata interface that also called jmi official matlab api for java was added alternatives mupad based symbolic math toolbox available from mathworks matlab can be connected maple mathematica libraries also exist import export mathml license matlab proprietary product mathworks so users are subject vendor lock-in although matlab builder products can deploy matlab functions library files which can be used with net java application building environment future development will still be tied matlab language each toolbox purchased separately if evaluation license requested mathworks sales department requires detailed information about project for which matlab be evaluated if granted which often evaluation license valid for two four weeks student version matlab available home-use license for matlab simulink subset mathwork's toolboxes at substantially
