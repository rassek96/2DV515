libraries total can be said be stage on which computer programs can run platform can be seen both constraint on application development process that different platforms provide different functionality restrictions assistance development process that they provide low-level functionality ready-made for example os may be platform that abstracts underlying differences hardware provides generic command for saving files accessing network contents components operating system examples o mobile software frameworks hardware examples software examples first party software see also references external links components platforms may also include hardware alone case small embedded systems embedded systems can access hardware directly without os this referred running on bare metal browser case web-based software browser itself runs on hardware+os platform but this not relevant software running within browser application such spreadsheet word processor which hosts software written application-specific scripting language such excel macro this can be extended writing fully-fledged applications with microsoft office suite platform software frameworks that provide ready-made functionality cloud computing platform service extending idea software framework these allow application developers build software out components that are hosted not by developer but by provider with internet communication linking them together social networking sites twitter facebook are also considered development platforms virtual machine vm such java virtual machine net clr applications are compiled into format similar machine code known bytecode which then executed by vm virtualized version complete system including virtualized hardware os software storage these allow for instance typical windows program run on what physically mac some architectures have multiple layers with each layer acting platform one above general component only has be adapted layer immediately beneath for instance java program has be written use java virtual machine jvm associated libraries platform but does not have be adapted run for windows linux macintosh os platforms however jvm layer beneath application does have be built separately for each os operating system examples for more details on this topic see list operating systems amigaos amigaos freebsd netbsd openbsd linux microsoft windows
