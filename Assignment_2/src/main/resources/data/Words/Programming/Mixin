mixin from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search this article about programming concept for ice cream see mix-in object-oriented programming languages mixin class that contains methods for use by other classes without having be parent class those other classes how those other classes gain access mixin's methods depends on language mixins are sometimes described being included rather than inherited mixins encourage code reuse can be used avoid inheritance ambiguity that multiple inheritance can cause diamond problem work around lack support for multiple inheritance language mixin can also be viewed interface with implemented methods this pattern example enforcing dependency inversion principle contents history definition advantages implementations programming languages that use mixins examples o common lisp o python o ruby o javascript o other languages interfaces traits o scala o swift see also references external links history mixins first appeared symbolics' object-oriented flavors system developed by howard cannon which was approach object-orientation used lisp machine lisp name was inspired by steve's ice cream parlor somerville massachusetts owner ice cream shop offered basic flavor ice cream vanilla chocolate etc blended combination extra items nuts cookies fudge etc called item mix-in his own trademarked term at time definition mixins are language concept that allows programmer inject some code into class mixin programming style software development which units functionality are created class then mixed with other classes mixin class acts parent class containing desired functionality subclass can then inherit simply reuse this functionality but not means specialization typically mixin will export desired functionality child class without creating rigid single relationship here lies important difference between concepts mixins inheritance that child class can still inherit all features parent class but semantics about child being kind parent need not be necessarily applied advantages provides mechanism for multiple inheritance by allowing multiple classes use common functionality but without complex semantics multiple inheritance code reusability mixins are useful when programmer wants share functionality between different classes instead repeating same code over over again common functionality can simply be grouped into mixin then inherited into each class that requires mixins allows inheritance use only desired features from parent class not necessarily all features from parent class implementations simula classes are defined block which attributes methods class initialization are all defined together thus all methods that can be invoked on class are defined together definition class complete flavors mixin class from which another class can inherit slot definitions methods mixin usually does not have direct instances since flavor can inherit from more than one other flavor can inherit from one more mixins note that original flavors did not use generic functions new flavors successor flavors clos methods are organized generic functions these generic functions are functions that are defined multiple cases methods by class dispatch method combinations clos flavors allow mixin methods add behavior existing methods before after daemons whoppers wrappers flavors clos added around methods ability call shadowed methods via call-next-method so for example stream-lock-mixin can add locking around existing methods stream class flavors one would write wrapper whopper clos one would use around method both clos flavors allow computed reuse via method combinations before after around methods are feature standard method combination other method combinations are provided example + method combination where results all applicable methods generic function are added compute return value this used for example with border-mixin for graphical objects graphical object may have generic width function border-mixin would add border around object has method computing its width new class bordered-button that both graphical object uses border mixin would compute its width by calling all applicable width methods—via + method combination all return values are added create combined width object oopsla paper gilad bracha william cook reinterpret different inheritance mechanisms found smalltalk beta clos special forms mixin inheritance programming languages that use mixins other than flavors clos part common lisp some languages that use mixins are ada by extending existing tagged record with arbitrary operations generic cobra coldfusion class based using includes object based by assigning methods from one object another at runtime curl with curl rte d called template mixins d also includes mixin statement that compiles strings code dart factor groovy javascript delegation -
