llvm from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search llvm original authors vikram adve chris lattner evan cheng developers llvm developer group initial release years ago stable release / september months ago repository llvmorg/viewvc/llvm-project/ written c++ operating system cross-platform type compiler license university illinois/ncsa open source license website llvmorg llvm compiler infrastructure project formerly low level virtual machine collection modular reusable compiler toolchain technologies used develop compiler front ends back ends llvm written c++ designed for compile-time link-time run-time idle-time optimization programs written arbitrary programming languages originally implemented for c c++ language-agnostic design llvm has since spawned wide variety front ends languages with compilers that use llvm include actionscript ada c common lisp crystal d delphi fortran opengl shading language halide haskell java bytecode julia lua objective-c pony python r ruby rust cuda scala swift llvm project started at university illinois at urbana–champaign under direction vikram adve chris lattner llvm was originally developed research infrastructure investigate dynamic compilation techniques for static dynamic programming languages llvm was released under university illinois/ncsa open source license permissive free software licence apple inc hired lattner formed team work on llvm system for various uses within apple's development systems llvm integral part apple's latest development tools for os x ios since sony has been using llvm's primary front end clang compiler software development kit sdk its ps4 console name llvm was originally initialism for low level virtual machine but this became increasingly less apt llvm became umbrella project that included variety other compiler low-level tool technologies so project abandoned initialism now llvm brand that applies llvm umbrella project llvm intermediate representation ir llvm debugger llvm c++ standard library with full support c++11 c++14 etc llvm administered by llvm foundation its president compiler engineer tanya lattner association for computing machinery presented adve lattner evan cheng with acm software system award for llvm contents overview description components o front ends programming language support + standard library support o llvm intermediate representation o back ends instruction set microarchitecture support + llvm mc o integrated linker lld o debugger revision history see also references external links overview description llvm can provide middle layers complete compiler system taking intermediate representation ir code from compiler emitting optimized ir this new ir can then be converted linked into machine-dependent assembly language code for target platform llvm can accept ir from gnu compiler collection gcc toolchain allowing be used with wide array extant compilers written for that project llvm can also generate relocatable machine code at compile-time link-time even binary machine code at run-time llvm supports language-independent instruction set type system each instruction static single assignment form ssa meaning that each variable called typed register assigned once then frozen this helps simplify analysis dependencies among variables llvm allows code be compiled statically under traditional gcc system left for late-compiling from ir machine code via just-in-time compilation jit similar java type system consists basic types such integer floating point numbers five derived types pointers arrays vectors structures functions type construct concrete language can be represented by combining these basic types llvm for example class c++ can be represented by mix structures functions arrays function pointers llvm jit compiler can optimize unneeded static branches out program at runtime thus useful for partial evaluation cases where program has many options most which can easily be determined unneeded specific environment this feature used opengl pipeline mac os x leopard v105 provide support for missing hardware features graphics code within opengl stack was left intermediate representation then compiled when run on target machine on systems with high-end graphics processing units gpus resulting code was quite thin passing instructions onto gpu with minimal changes on systems with low-end gpus llvm would compile optional procedures that run on local central processing unit cpu that emulate instructions that gpu cannot run internally llvm improved performance on low-end machines using intel gma chipsets similar system was developed under gallium3d llvmpipe incorporated into gnome shell allow run without proper hardware driver loaded for run-time performance compiled programs gcc formerly outperformed llvm by 10% on average newer results indicate that llvm has now caught up with gcc this area now compiling binaries approximately equal performance components llvm has become umbrella project containing multiple components front ends programming language support llvm was originally written be replacement for existing code generator gcc stack many gcc front ends have been modified work with llvm currently supports compiling ada c c++ d delphi fortran haskell objective-c swift using various front ends some derived from version gnu compiler collection gcc widespread interest llvm has led several efforts develop new front ends for variety languages one that has received most attention clang new compiler supporting c c++ objective-c primarily supported by apple clang aimed at replacing c/objective-c compiler gcc system with system that more easily integrated with integrated development environments ides has wider support for multithreading support for openmp directives has been included clang since release objective-c development under gcc was stagnant apple's changes language were supported separately maintained branch utrecht haskell compiler can generate code for llvm though generator early stages development many cases has been more efficient than c code generator glasgow haskell compiler ghc has working llvm backend that achieves 30% speed-up compiled code relative native code compiling via ghc c code generation followed by compiling missing only one many optimizing techniques implemented by ghc many other components are various stages development including but not limited rust compiler java bytecode front end common intermediate language cil front end macruby implementation ruby various front ends for standard ml new graph coloring register allocator standard library support llvm supports its own standard library but also alternative c standard library musl with initial support for arm llvm intermediate representation llvm ir used eg by radeonsi by llvmpipe both are part mesa core llvm intermediate representation ir low-level programming language similar assembly ir strongly typed reduced instruction set computing risc instruction set which abstracts away details target for example calling convention abstracted through call ret instructions with explicit arguments also instead fixed set registers ir uses infinite set temporaries form %0 %1 etc llvm supports three isomorphic forms ir human-readable assembly format c++ object format suitable for frontends dense bitcode format for serializing simple hello world program assembly format @str = internal constant chello world\0a\00 declare i32 @printfi8 define i32 @maini32 %argc i8 %argv nounwind { entry %tmp1 = getelementptr @str i32 i32 %tmp2 = call i32 i8 @printf i8 %tmp1 nounwind ret i32 } back ends instruction set microarchitecture support at version llvm supports many instruction sets including arm qualcomm hexagon mips nvidia parallel thread execution ptx called nvptx llvm documentation powerpc amd terascale amd graphics core next gcn sparc z/architecture called systemz llvm documentation x86/x86-64 xcore some features are not available on some platforms most features are present for x86/x86-64 z/architecture arm powerpc llvm mc llvm machine code mc subproject llvm's framework for translating machine instructions between textual forms machine code formerly llvm relied on system assembler one provided by toolchain translate assembly into machine code llvm mc's integrated assembler supports most llvm targets including x86 x86-64 arm arm64 for some targets including various mips instruction sets integrated assembly support usable but still beta stage integrated linker lld lld subproject attempt develop built-in platform independent linker for llvm currently clang llvm must invoke system target linker produce executable this prevents clang from using linker features not present on all supported versions linker for platform lld aims remove dependence on third party linker debugger main article lldb debugger revision history revision history version release date september july march
