message computability theory system data-manipulation rules such computer's instruction set programming language cellular automaton said be turing complete computationally universal if can be used simulate any single-taped turing machine concept named after english mathematician alan turing classic example lambda calculus closely related concept that turing equivalence – two computers p q are called equivalent if p can simulate q q can simulate p church–turing thesis conjectures that any function whose values can be computed by algorithm can be computed by turing machine therefore that if any real-world computer can be simulated by turing machine turing equivalent turing machine universal turing machine can be used simulate any turing machine by extension computational aspects any possible real-world computer show that something turing complete enough show that can be used simulate some turing complete system for example imperative language turing complete if has conditional branching eg if goto statements branch if zero instruction see oisc ability change arbitrary amount memory eg ability maintain arbitrary number variables since this almost always case most if not all imperative languages are turing complete if limitations finite memory are ignored contents non-mathematical usage formal definitions history computability theory turing oracles digital physics examples o games non-turing-complete languages o data languages see also notes references further reading external links non-mathematical usage colloquial usage terms turing complete turing equivalent are used mean that any real-world general-purpose computer computer language can approximately simulate computational aspects any other real-world general-purpose computer computer language real computers constructed so far are essentially similar single-tape turing machine thus associated mathematics can apply by abstracting their operation far enough however real computers have limited physical resources so they are only linear bounded automaton complete contrast universal computer defined device with turing complete instruction set infinite memory infinite available time formal definitions computability theory several closely related terms are used describe computational power computational system such abstract machine programming language turing completeness computational system that can compute every turing-computable function called turing-complete turing-powerful alternatively such system one that can simulate universal turing machine turing equivalence turing-complete system called turing equivalent if every function can compute also turing computable ie computes precisely same class functions do turing machines alternatively turing-equivalent system one that can simulate be simulated by universal turing machine all known turing-complete systems are turing equivalent which adds support church–turing thesis computational universality system called universal with respect class systems if can compute every function computable by systems that class can simulate each those systems typically term universality tacitly used with respect turing-complete class systems term weakly universal sometimes used distinguish system eg cellular automaton whose universality achieved only by modifying standard definition turing machine so include input streams with infinitely many 1s history turing completeness significant that every real-world design for computing device can be simulated by universal turing machine church–turing thesis states that this law mathematics – that universal turing machine can principle perform any calculation that any other programmable computer can this says nothing about effort needed write program time may take for machine perform calculation any abilities machine may possess that have nothing do with computation charles babbage's analytical engine 1830s would have been first turing-complete machine if had been built at time was designed babbage appreciated that machine was capable great feats calculation including primitive logical reasoning but he did not appreciate that no other machine could do better from 1830s until 1940s mechanical calculating machines such adders multipliers were built improved but they could not perform conditional branch therefore were not turing complete late 19th century leopold kronecker formulated notions computability defining primitive recursive functions these functions can be calculated by rote computation but they are not enough make universal computer because instructions which compute them do not allow for infinite loop early 20th century david hilbert led program axiomatize all mathematics with precise axioms precise logical rules deduction which could be performed by machine soon became clear that small set deduction rules are enough produce consequences any set axioms these rules were proved by kurt gödel be enough produce every theorem however they will always prove some theorems both true false for axiomatization not simpler than peano arithmetic actual notion computation was isolated soon after starting with gödel's incompleteness theorem this theorem showed that axiom systems were limited when reasoning about computation which deduces their theorems church turing independently demonstrated that hilbert's entscheidungsproblem decision problem was unsolvable thus identifying computational core incompleteness theorem this work along with gödel's work on general recursive functions established that there are sets simple instructions which when put together are able produce any computation work gödel showed that notion computation essentially unique computability theory first result computability theory that impossible general predict what turing-complete program will do over arbitrarily long time for example impossible determine for every program-input pair whether program operating on input will eventually stop will continue forever see halting problem impossible determine whether program will return true whether will return false for any characteristic program's eventual output impossible determine whether this characteristic will hold this can cause problems practice when analyzing real-world computer programs one way avoid this cause programs stop executing after fixed period time timeout limit power flow control instructions such systems are not turing complete by design another theorem shows that there are problems solvable by turing-complete languages that cannot be solved by any language with only finite looping abilities ie any language that guarantees every program will eventually finish halt given guaranteed halting language computable function which produced by cantor's diagonal argument on all computable functions that language not computable that language turing oracles main article oracle machine computer with access infinite tape data may be more powerful than turing machine for instance tape might contain solution halting problem some other turing-undecidable problem such infinite tape data called turing oracle even turing oracle with random data not computable with probability since there are only countably many computations but uncountably many oracles so computer with random turing oracle can compute things that turing machine cannot digital physics all known laws physics have consequences that are computable by series approximations on digital computer hypothesis called digital physics states that this no accident because universe itself computable on universal turing machine this would imply that no computer more powerful than universal turing machine can be built physically see church–turing thesis – philosophical implications examples computational systems algebras calculi that are discussed turing complete systems are those intended for studying theoretical computer science they are intended be simple possible so that would be easier understand limits computation here are few automata theory formal grammar language generators formal language language recognizers lambda calculus post–turing machines most programming languages conventional unconventional are turing-complete this includes all general-purpose languages wide use o procedural programming languages such c pascal o object-oriented languages such cil java smalltalk o multi-paradigm languages such ada c++ common lisp object pascal most languages using less common paradigms o functional languages such lisp haskell o logic programming languages such prolog o declarative languages such xslt o esoteric programming languages form mathematical recreation which programmers work out how achieve basic programming constructs extremely difficult but mathematically turing-equivalent language rewrite systems are also turing-complete turing completeness abstract statement ability rather than prescription specific language features used implement that ability features used achieve turing completeness can be quite different fortran systems would use loop constructs possibly even goto statements achieve repetition haskell prolog lacking looping almost entirely would use recursion most programming languages are describing computations on von neumann architectures which have memory ram register control unit these two elements make this architecture turing-complete even pure functional languages are turing-complete turing completeness declarative sql implemented through recursive common table expressions unsurprisingly procedural extensions sql plsql etc are also turing complete this illustrates one reason why relatively powerful non-turing-complete languages are rare more powerful language initially more complex are tasks which applied sooner its lack completeness becomes perceived drawback encouraging its extension until turing complete untyped lambda calculus turing-complete but many typed lambda calculi including system f are not value typed systems based their ability represent most typical computer programs while detecting more errors rule conway's game life both cellular automata are turing complete games many games are turing-complete by accident video games braid dwarf fortress minecraft minesweeper littlebigplanet factorio pokémon yellow card games magic gathering zero-person games simulations conway's game life non-turing-complete languages many computational languages exist which are not turing complete one such example set regular languages which are generated by regular expressions which are recognized by finite automata more powerful but still not turing-complete extension finite automata category pushdown automata context-free grammars which are commonly used generate parse trees initial stage program compiling further examples include some early versions pixel shader languages embedded direct3d opengl extensions total functional programming languages such charity epigram all functions are total must terminate charity uses type system control constructs based on category theory whereas epigram uses dependent types loop language designed so that computes only functions that are primitive recursive all these compute proper subsets total computable functions since full set total computable functions not computably enumerable also since all functions these languages are total algorithms for recursively enumerable sets cannot be written these languages contrast with turing machines although untyped lambda calculus turing-complete simply typed lambda calculus not data languages notion turing-completeness does not apply languages such xml html json yaml s-expressions because they are typically used represent structured data not describe computation these are sometimes referred markup languages more properly container languages data description languages however rule turing-complete cellular automaton has been successfully implemented css thus proving extent its turing completeness fact not everybody agrees with that for example francis mccabe argues that css not turing-complete because there no option define functions css see also algorithmic information theory chomsky hierarchy church–turing thesis computability theory inner loop loop computing machine that always halts smn theorem
