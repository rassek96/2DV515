z3 computer from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search zuse z3 replica on display at deutsches museum munich z3 was electromechanical computer designed by konrad zuse was world's first working programmable fully automatic digital computer z3 was built with relays implementing 22-bit word length that operated at clock frequency about 5–10 hz program code constant data were stored on punched film z3 was completed berlin german aircraft research institute used perform statistical analyses wing flutter zuse asked german government for funding replace relays with fully electronic switches but funding was denied during world war ii since such development was deemed not war-important original z3 was destroyed during allied bombardment berlin z3 was originally called v3 versuchsmodell experimental model but was renamed not be confused with germany's v-weapons fully functioning replica was built 1960s by zuse's company zuse kg on permanent display at deutsches museum munich z3 was demonstrated be principle turing-complete thanks this machine its predecessors konrad zuse often regarded inventor computer contents design development z3 universal turing machine relation other work specifications see also references further reading external links design development zuse designed z1 built from z1 was wholly mechanical only worked for few minutes at time at most helmut schreyer advised zuse use different technology doctoral student at berlin institute technology he worked on implementation boolean operations today's terminology flip-flops on basis vacuum tubes schreyer demonstrated circuit on this basis small audience explained his vision electronic computing machine – but since largest operational electronic devices contained far fewer tubes this was considered practically infeasible zuse decided implement next design based on relays realization z2 was helped financially by dr kurt pannke who manufactured small calculating machines z2 was completed presented audience deutsche versuchsanstalt für luftfahrt german laboratory for aviation berlin-adlershof zuse was lucky – this presentation was one few instances where z2 actually worked could convince dvl partly finance next design improving on basic z2 machine he built z3 which was highly secret project german government dr joseph jennissen 1905–1977 member research-leadership forschungsführung reich air ministry acted government supervisor for orders ministry zuse's company zuse apparatebau further intermediary between zuse reich air ministry was aerodynamicist herbert wagner z3 was completed was faster far more reliable than z1 z2 z3 floating-point arithmetic was improved over that z1 that implemented exception handling exceptional values plus infinity minus infinity undefined could be generated passed through operations z3 stored its program on external tape thus no rewiring was necessary change programs on may z3 was presented audience scientists including professors alfred teichmann curt schmieden deutsche versuchsanstalt für luftfahrt german laboratory for aviation berlin today known german aerospace center cologne zuse moved on z4 design which was built just days before world war ii ended z3 universal turing machine was possible construct loops on z3 but there was no conditional branch instruction nevertheless z3 was turing-complete – how implement universal turing machine on z3 was shown by raúl rojas he proposes that tape program would have be long enough execute every possible path through both sides every branch would compute all possible answers but unneeded results would be canceled out kind speculative execution rojas concludes we can therefore say that from abstract theoretical perspective computing model z3 equivalent computing model today's computers from practical perspective way z3 was really programmed was not equivalent modern computers from pragmatic point view however z3 provided quite practical instruction set for typical engineering applications 1940s – zuse was civil engineer who only started build his computers facilitate his work his main profession relation other work success zuse's z3 often attributed its use simple binary system this was invented roughly three centuries earlier by gottfried leibniz boole later used develop his boolean algebra claude shannon introduced idea mapping boolean algebra onto electronic relays seminal work on digital circuit design zuse however did not know shannon's work developed groundwork independently for his first computer z1 which he designed built from zuse's coworker helmut schreyer built electronic digital experimental model computer using vacuum tubes but was lost at end war tommy flowers-built colossus atanasoff–berry computer used thermionic valves vacuum tubes binary representation numbers programming was by means re-plugging patch panels setting switches eniac computer completed after war used vacuum tubes implement switches used decimal representation for numbers until programming was with colossus by patch leads switches manchester baby edsac were world's first computers that stored program instructions data same space this they implemented stored-program concept which frequently but erroneously attributed paper by john von neumann colleagues von neumann said have given due credit alan turing concept had actually been mentioned earlier by konrad zuse himself patent application that was rejected konrad zuse himself remembered his memoirs during war would have barely been possible build efficient stored program devices anyway friedrich l bauer wrote his visionary ideas live programs which were only be published years afterwards aimed at right practical direction but were never implemented by him
