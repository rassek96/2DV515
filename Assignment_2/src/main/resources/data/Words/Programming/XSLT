xslt from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search xslt paradigm declarative developer w3c first appeared stable release preview release website w3c transformation major implementations libxslt saxon xalan influenced by dsssl xslt extensible stylesheet language transformations language for transforming xml documents into other xml documents other formats such html for web pages plain text xsl formatting objects which may subsequently be converted other formats such pdf postscript png xslt widely supported modern web browsers original document not changed rather new document created based on content existing one typically input documents are xml files but anything from which processor can build xquery xpath data model can be used such relational database tables geographical information systems xslt turing-complete language meaning can specify any computation that can be performed by computer contents history design processing model processor implementations

xslt influenced by functional languages by text-based pattern matching languages like snobol awk its most direct predecessor dsssl which did for sgml what xslt does for xml xslt xslt was part world wide web consortium w3c's extensible stylesheet language xsl development effort 1998–1999 project that also produced xsl-fo xpath some members standards committee that developed xslt including james clark editor had previously worked on dsssl xslt was published w3c recommendation november xslt after abortive attempt create version xsl working group joined forces with xquery working group create xpath with richer data model type system based on xml schema most recent version xslt developed under editorship michael kay reached recommendation status january however xslt still widely used since not supported natively web browsers for environments like lamp xslt had w3c last call working draft status october main new features are o streaming transformations previous versions entire input document had be read into memory before could be processed output could not be written until processing had finished although saxon does have streaming extension working draft allows xml streaming which will be useful for processing documents too large fit memory when transformations are chained xml pipelines o improvements modularity large stylesheets o improved handling dynamic errors with for example xsltry instruction o functions can now be arguments other higher-order functions design processing model diagram basic elements process flow extensible stylesheet language transformations xslt processor takes one more xml source documents plus one more xslt stylesheets processes them produce output document contrast widely implemented imperative programming languages like c xslt declarative basic processing paradigm pattern matching rather than listing imperative sequence actions perform stateful environment template rules only define how handle node matching particular xpath-like pattern if processor should happen encounter one contents templates effectively comprise functional expressions that directly represent their evaluated form result tree which basis processor's output processor follows fixed algorithm first assuming stylesheet has already been read prepared processor builds source tree from input xml document then processes source tree's root node finds best-matching template for that node stylesheet evaluates template's contents instructions each template generally direct processor either create nodes result tree process more nodes source tree same way root node output derives from result tree processor implementations altova raptorxml server cross-platform engine that supports xslt most xpath some features from xslt working draft also xquery allows command line operations interfaces com java net also includes built-in http server exselt streaming xslt processor which runs on net framework written f fully supports xslt draft xpath recommendation xdm recommendation standards libxslt free library released under mit license that can be reused commercial applications based on libxml implemented c for speed portability supports xslt exslt extensions o can be used at command line via xsltproc which included os x many linux distributions can be used on windows via cygwin o webkit blink layout engines used for example safari chrome web browsers respectively uses libxslt library do xsl transformations o bindings exist for python perl ruby php common lisp tcl c++ msxml net msxml includes xslt processor from msxml includes command line utility msxslexe saxon xslt partial xquery processor with open-source proprietary versions for stand-alone operation for java javascript net quixslt xslt processor doing streaming implemented java by innovimax inria xalan open source xslt processor from apache software foundation available stand-alone for java c++ web browsers safari chrome firefox opera internet explorer all support xslt none support xslt natively although third party products like saxon-ce frameless can provide this functionality browsers can perform on-the-fly transformations xml files display transformation output browser window this done either by embedding xsl xml document by referencing file containing xsl instructions from xml document latter may not work with chrome because its security model xmlstarlet set command line utilities tools which can be used transform query validate edit xml documents can apply xslt stylesheets xml documents does not require java uses libxslt supports xslt xuriella plexippus-xpath are xslt processors written common lisp performance most early xslt processors were interpreters more recently code generation increasingly common using portable intermediate languages such java bytecode net common intermediate language target however even interpretive products generally offer separate analysis execution phases allowing optimized expression tree be created memory reused perform multiple transformations this gives substantial performance benefits online publishing applications where same transformation applied many times per second different source documents this separation reflected design xslt processing apis such jaxp early xslt processors had very few optimizations stylesheet documents were read into document object models processor would act on them directly xpath engines were also not optimized increasingly however xslt processors use optimization techniques found functional programming languages database query languages such static rewriting expression tree eg move calculations out loops lazy pipelined evaluation reduce memory footprint intermediate results allow early exit when processor can evaluate expression such following-sibling without complete evaluation all subexpressions many processors also use tree representations that are significantly more efficient both space time than general-purpose dom implementations june debbie lockett michael kay introduced open-source benchmarking framework for xslt processors called xt-speedo xslt xpath for more details on this topic see xpath xslt uses xpath identify subsets source document tree perform calculations xpath also provides range functions which xslt itself further augments xslt uses xpath xslt uses xpath xslt uses xpath case specifications were published on same date with however they were no longer synchronized xpath became recommendation april while xslt was still work progress xslt xquery compared for more details on this topic see xquery § xquery xslt compared xslt functionalities overlap with those xquery which was initially conceived query language for large collections xml documents xslt xquery standards were developed by separate working groups within w3c working together ensure common approach where appropriate they share same data model type system function library both include xpath sublanguage two languages however are rooted different traditions serve needs different communities xslt was primarily conceived stylesheet language whose primary goal was render xml for human reader on screen on web web template language on paper xquery was primarily conceived database query language tradition sql because two languages originate different communities xslt stronger its handling narrative documents with more flexible structure while xquery stronger its data handling for example when performing relational joins xslt media types element can optionally take attribute media-type which allows one set media type mime type for resulting output for example xslt recommendation recommends more general attribute types text/xml application/xml since for long time there was no registered media type for xslt during this time text/xsl became de facto standard xslt was not specified how media-type values should be used with release xslt w3c recommended registration mime media type application/xslt+xml was later registered with internet assigned numbers authority pre-10 working drafts xslt used text/xsl their embedding examples this type was implemented continues be promoted by microsoft internet explorer msxml also widely recognized xml-stylesheet processing instruction by other browsers practice therefore users wanting control transformation browser using this processing instruction are obliged use this unregistered media type xslt examples for grouping problems see xslt/muenchian grouping below sample incoming xml document john smith morka ismincius example transforming xml xml this xslt stylesheet provides templates transform xml document its evaluation results new xml document having another structure john morka example transforming xml xhtml processing following example xslt file testing xml example persons with xml input file shown above results following xhtml whitespace has been adjusted here for clarity testing xml example persons ismincius morka smith john this xhtml generates output below when rendered web browser rendered xhtml generated from xml input file xslt transformation order for web browser be able automatically apply xsl transformation xml document on display xml stylesheet processing instruction can be inserted into xml so for example if stylesheet example above were available example2xsl following instruction could be added original incoming xml this example text/xsl technically incorrect according w3c specifications which say type should be text/xml but only media type that widely supported across browsers see also xslt elements – list some commonly used xslt
