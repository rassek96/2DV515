high-level programming languages which at runtime execute many common programming behaviors that static programming languages perform during compilation these behaviors could include extension program by adding new code by extending objects definitions by modifying type system although similar behaviours can be emulated nearly any language with varying degrees difficulty complexity performance costs dynamic languages provide direct tools make use them many these features were first implemented native features lisp programming language most dynamic languages are also dynamically typed but not all are dynamic languages are frequently but not always referred scripting languages although term scripting language its narrowest sense refers languages specific given run-time environment contents implementation o eval o object runtime alteration o functional programming + closures + continuations o reflection o macros examples o computation code at runtime late binding o object runtime alteration o assembling code at runtime based on class instances examples see also references further reading external links implementation ] this section needs expansion you can help by adding october eval some dynamic languages offer eval function this function takes string parameter containing code language executes if this code stands for expression resulting value returned however erik meijer peter drayton suggest that programmers use eval poor man's substitute for higher-order functions object runtime alteration type object system can typically be modified during runtime dynamic language this can mean generating new objects from runtime definition based on mixins existing types objects this can also refer changing inheritance type tree thus altering way that existing types behave especially with respect invocation methods functional programming functional programming concepts are feature many dynamic languages also derive from lisp closures one most widely used aspects functional programming dynamic languages closure which allows creating new instance function which retains access context which was created simple example this generating function for scanning text for word function newscanner word tempfunction = function input scanfortext input word end function return tempfunction end function note that inner function has no name instead stored variable tempfunction each time newscanner executed will return new function which remembers value word parameter that was passed when was defined closures are one core tools functional programming many languages support at least this degree functional programming continuations another feature some dynamic languages continuation continuations represent execution states that can be re-invoked for example parser might return intermediate result continuation that when invoked will continue parse input continuations interact very complex ways with scoping especially with respect closures for this reason many dynamic languages do not provide continuations reflection reflection common many dynamic languages typically involves analysis types metadata generic polymorphic data can however also include full evaluation modification program's code data such features that lisp provides analyzing s-expressions macros limited number dynamic programming languages provide features which combine code introspection ability examine classes functions keywords know what they are what they do what they know eval feature called macros most programmers today who are aware term macro have encountered them c c++ where they are static feature which are built small subset language are capable only string substitutions on text program dynamic languages however they provide access inner workings compiler full access interpreter virtual machine runtime allowing definition language-like constructs which can optimize code modify syntax grammar language assembly c c++ early java fortran do not generally fit into this category examples following examples show dynamic features using language common lisp its common lisp object system computation code at runtime late binding example shows how function can be modified at runtime from computed source code source code stored data variable cl-user > defparameter best-guess-formula 'lambda x x x best-guess-formula function created from code compiled at runtime function available under name best-guess cl-user > compile 'best-guess best-guess-formula function can be called cl-user > best-guess source code might be improved at runtime cl-user > setf best-guess-formula `lambda x list 'sqrt third best-guess-formula lambda x sqrt x x new version function being compiled cl-user > compile 'best-guess best-guess-formula next call will call new function feature late binding cl-user > best-guess object runtime alteration this example shows how existing instance can be changed include new slot when its class changes that existing method can be replaced with new version person class person has name cl-user > defclass person name initarg name custom printing method for objects class person cl-user > defmethod print-object p person stream print-unreadable-object p stream type t format stream ~a slot-value p 'name one example person instance cl-user > setf person-1 make-instance 'person name eva luator class person gets second slot then has slots name age cl-user > defclass person name initarg name age initarg age initform unknown updating method print object cl-user > defmethod print-object p person stream print-unreadable-object p stream type t format stream ~a age ~ slot-value p 'name slot-value p 'age existing object has now changed has additional slot new print method cl-user > person-1 we can set new age slot instance cl-user > setf slot-value person-1 'age object has been updated cl-user > person-1 assembling code at runtime based on class instances next example class person gets new superclass print method gets redefined such that assembles several methods into effective method effective method gets assembled based on class argument at runtime available applicable methods class person cl-user > defclass person name initarg name person just prints its name cl-user > defmethod print-object p person stream print-unreadable-object p stream type t format stream ~a slot-value p 'name person instance cl-user > defparameter person-1 make-instance 'person name eva luator person-1 displaying person instance cl-user > person-1 now redefining print method be extensible around method creates context for print method calls next method cl-user > defmethod print-object around p person stream print-unreadable-object p stream type t call-next-method primary method prints name cl-user > defmethod print-object p person stream format stream ~a slot-value p 'name new class id-mixin provides id cl-user > defclass id-mixin id initarg id print method just prints value id slot cl-user > defmethod print-object after object id-mixin stream format stream id ~a slot-value object 'id now we redefine class person include mixin id-mixin cl-user > defclass person id-mixin name initarg name existing instance person-1 now has new slot we set cl-user > setf slot-value person-1 'id displaying object again print-object function now has effective method which calls three methods around method primary method after method cl-user > person-1 examples popular dynamic programming languages include javascript python ruby php lua perl following are generally
