game boy this example wide-carriage dot matrix printer designed for 14-inch mm wide paper shown with 85-by-14-inch mm × mm legal paper wide carriage printers were often used field businesses print accounting records on 11-by-14-inch mm × mm tractor-feed paper they were also called 132-column printers play media video showing inkjet printer while printing page computing printer peripheral which makes persistent human-readable representation graphics text on paper similar physical media world's first computer printer was 19th-century mechanically driven apparatus invented by charles babbage for his difference engine first commercial printers generally used mechanisms from electric typewriters teletype machines demand for higher speed led development new systems specifically for computer use 1980s were daisy wheel systems similar typewriters line printers that produced similar output but at much higher speed dot matrix systems that could mix text graphics but produced relatively low-quality output plotter was used for those requiring high quality line art like blueprints introduction low-cost laser printer with first hp laserjet addition postscript next year's apple laserwriter set off revolution printing known desktop publishing laser printers using postscript mixed text graphics like dot-matrix printers but at quality levels formerly available only from commercial typesetting systems by most simple printing tasks like fliers brochures were now created on personal computers then laser printed expensive offset printing systems were being dumped scrap hp deskjet offered same advantages laser printer terms flexibility but produced somewhat lower quality output depending on paper from much less expensive mechanisms inkjet systems rapidly displaced dot matrix daisy wheel printers from market by 2000s high-quality printers this sort had fallen under $100 price point became commonplace rapid update internet email through 1990s into 2000s has largely displaced need for printing means moving documents wide variety reliable storage systems means that physical backup little benefit today even desire for printed output for offline reading while on mass transit aircraft has been displaced by e-book readers tablet computers today traditional printers are being used more for special purposes like printing photographs artwork are no longer must-have peripheral starting around printing became area intense interest allowing creation physical objects with same sort effort early laser printer required produce brochure these devices are

individual users may be connected only single computer these printers are designed for low-volume short-turnaround print jobs requiring minimal setup time produce hard copy given document however they are generally slow devices ranging from around pages per minute ppm cost per page relatively high however this offset by on-demand convenience some printers can print documents stored on memory cards from digital cameras scanners networked shared printers are designed for high-volume high-speed printing they are usually shared by many users on network can print at speeds around ppm xerox could achieve ppm virtual printer piece computer software whose user interface api resembles that printer driver but which not connected with physical computer printer virtual printer can be used create file which image data which would be printed for archival purposes input another program for example create pdf transmit another system user printer device for making three-dimensional object from model other electronic data source through additive processes which successive layers material including plastics metals food cement wood other materials are laid down under computer control called printer by analogy with inkjet printer which produces two-dimensional document by similar process depositing layer ink on paper technology choice print technology has great effect on cost printer cost operation speed quality permanence documents noise some printer technologies don't work with certain types physical media such carbon paper transparencies second aspect printer technology that often forgotten resistance alteration liquid ink such from inkjet head fabric ribbon becomes absorbed by paper fibers so documents printed with liquid ink are more difficult alter than documents printed with toner solid inks which do not penetrate below paper surface cheques can be printed with liquid ink on special cheque paper with toner anchorage so that alterations may be detected machine-readable lower portion cheque must be printed using micr toner ink banks other clearing houses employ automation equipment that relies on magnetic flux from these specially printed characters function properly modern print technology following printing technologies are routinely found modern printers toner-based printers main article laser printer laser printer rapidly produces high quality text graphics with digital photocopiers multifunction printers mfps laser printers employ xerographic printing process but differ from analog photocopiers that image produced by direct scanning laser beam across printer's photoreceptor another toner-based printer led printer which uses array leds instead laser cause toner adhesion print drum liquid inkjet printers liquid ink cartridge from hewlett-packard hp 845c inkjet printer inkjet printers operate by propelling variably sized droplets liquid ink onto almost any sized page they are most common type computer printer used by consumers solid ink printers main article solid ink solid ink printers also known phase-change printers are type thermal transfer printer they use solid sticks cmyk-coloured ink similar consistency candle wax which are melted fed into piezo crystal operated print-head printhead sprays ink on rotating oil coated drum paper then passes over print drum at which time image immediately transferred transfixed page solid ink printers are most commonly used colour office printers are excellent at printing on transparencies other non-porous media solid ink printers can produce excellent results acquisition operating costs are similar laser printers drawbacks technology include high energy consumption long warm-up times from cold state also some users complain that resulting prints are difficult write on wax tends repel inks from pens are difficult feed through automatic document feeders but these traits have been significantly reduced later models addition this type printer only available from one manufacturer xerox manufactured part their xerox phaser office printer line previously solid ink printers were manufactured by tektronix but tek sold printing business xerox dye-sublimation printers main article dye-sublimation printer disassembled dye sublimation cartridge dye-sublimation printer dye-sub printer printer which employs printing process that uses heat transfer dye medium such plastic card paper canvas process usually lay one colour at time using ribbon that has colour panels dye-sub printers are intended primarily for high-quality colour applications including colour photography are less well-suited for text while once province high-end print shops dye-sublimation printers are now increasingly used dedicated consumer photo printers thermal printers receipt printer printing twitter timeline thermal printers work by selectively heating regions special heat-sensitive paper monochrome thermal printers are used cash registers atms gasoline dispensers some older inexpensive fax machines colours can be achieved with special papers different temperatures heating rates for different colours these coloured sheets are not required black-and-white output one example zink portmanteau zero ink obsolete special-purpose printing technologies epson mx-80 popular model dot-matrix printer use for many years following technologies are either obsolete limited special applications though most were at one time widespread use impact printers impact printers rely on forcible impact transfer ink media impact printer uses print head that either hits surface ink ribbon pressing ink ribbon against paper similar action typewriter less commonly hits back paper pressing paper against ink ribbon ibm for example all but dot matrix printer rely on use fully formed characters letterforms that represent each characters that printer was capable printing addition most these printers were limited monochrome sometimes two-color printing single typeface at one time although bolding underlining text could be done by overstriking that printing two more impressions either same character position slightly offset impact printers varieties include typewriter-derived printers teletypewriter-derived printers daisywheel printers dot matrix printers line printers dot matrix printers remain common use businesses where multi-part forms are printed overview impact printing contains detailed description many technologies used typewriter-derived printers typeball print element from ibm selectric-type printer main articles friden flexowriter ibm selectric typewriter several different computer printers were simply computer-controllable versions existing electric typewriters friden flexowriter ibm selectric-based printers were most-common examples flexowriter printed with conventional typebar mechanism while selectric used ibm's well-known golf ball printing mechanism either case letter form then struck ribbon which was pressed against paper printing one character at time maximum speed selectric printer faster two was characters per second teletypewriter-derived printers main article teleprinter common teleprinter could easily be interfaced computer became very popular except for those computers manufactured by ibm some models used typebox that was positioned x- y-axes by mechanism selected letter form was struck by hammer others used type cylinder similar way selectric typewriters used their type ball either case letter form then struck ribbon print letterform most teleprinters operated at ten characters per second although few achieved cps daisy wheel printers daisy wheel print element main article daisy wheel printer daisy wheel printers operate much same fashion typewriter hammer strikes wheel with petals daisy wheel each petal containing letter form at its tip letter form strikes ribbon ink depositing ink on page thus printing character by rotating daisy wheel different characters are selected for printing these printers were also referred letter-quality printers because they could produce text which was clear crisp typewriter fastest letter-quality printers printed at characters per second dot-matrix printers main article dot matrix printer sample output from 9-pin dot matrix printer one character expanded show detail term dot matrix printer used for impact printers that use matrix small pins transfer ink page advantage dot matrix over other impact printers that they can produce graphical images addition text however text generally poorer quality than impact printers that use letterforms type dot-matrix printers can be broadly divided into two major classes ballistic wire printers stored energy printers dot matrix printers can either be character-based line-based that single horizontal series pixels across page referring configuration print head 1970s & 80s dot matrix printers were one more common types printers used for general use such for home small office use such printers normally had either pins on print head early pin printers also existed which did not print descenders there was period during early home computer era when range printers were manufactured under many brands such commodore vic-1525 using seikosha uni-hammer system this used single solenoid with oblique striker that would be actuated times for each column vertical pixels while head was moving at constant speed angle striker would align dots vertically even though head had moved one dot spacing time vertical dot position was controlled by synchronised longitudinally ribbed platen behind paper that rotated rapidly with rib moving vertically seven dot spacings time took print one pixel column 24-pin print heads were able print at higher quality started offer additional type styles were marketed near letter quality by some vendors once price inkjet printers dropped point where they were competitive with dot matrix printers dot matrix printers began fall out favour for general use some dot matrix printers such nec p6300 can be upgraded print colour this achieved through use four-colour ribbon mounted on mechanism provided upgrade kit that replaces standard black ribbon mechanism after installation that raises lowers ribbons needed colour graphics are generally printed four passes at standard resolution thus slowing down printing considerably result colour graphics can take up four times longer print than standard monochrome graphics up 8-16 times long at high resolution mode dot matrix printers are still commonly used low-cost low-quality applications such cash registers demanding very high volume applications like invoice printing impact printing unlike laser printing allows pressure print head be applied stack two more forms print multi-part documents such sales invoices credit card receipts using continuous stationery with carbonless copy paper dot-matrix printers were being superseded even receipt printers after end twentieth century line printers main article line printer line printers print entire line text at time four principal designs exist print drum from drum printer drum printers where horizontally mounted rotating drum carries entire character set printer repeated each printable character position ibm printer example drum printer drum printers are also found adding machines other numeric printers pos dimensions are compact only dozen characters need be supported ibm line printer chain train printers where character set arranged multiple times around linked chain set character slugs track traveling horizontally past print line ibm perhaps most popular comes both chain train varieties band printer later variant where characters are embossed on flexible steel band lp27 from digital equipment corporation band printer bar printers where character set attached solid bar that moves horizontally along print line such ibm fourth design used mainly on very early printers such ibm features independent type bars one for each printable position each bar contains character set be printed bars moves vertically position character be printed front print hammer each case print line precisely timed hammers strike against back paper at exact moment that correct character be printed passing front paper paper presses forward against ribbon which then presses against character form impression character form printed onto paper comb printers also called line matrix printers represent fifth major design these printers are hybrid dot matrix printing line printing these printers comb hammers prints portion row pixels at one time such every eighth pixel by shifting comb back forth slightly entire pixel row can be printed continuing example just eight cycles paper then advances next pixel row printed because far less motion involved than conventional dot matrix printer these printers are very fast compared dot matrix printers are competitive speed with formed-character line printers while also being able print dot matrix graphics printronix p7000 series line matrix printers are still manufactured line printers are fastest all impact printers are used for bulk printing large computer centres line printer can print at lines per minute faster frequently printing pages more rapidly than many current laser printers on other hand mechanical components line printers operat with tight tolerances require regular preventive maintenance pm produce top quality print they are virtually never used with personal computers have now been replaced by high-speed laser

printers use chemical coated paper which charged by print head according image document paper passed near pool liquid ink with opposite charge charged areas paper attract ink thus form image this process was developed from process electrostatic copying color reproduction very accurate because there no heating scale distortion less than ±01% all laser printers have accuracy ±1% worldwide most survey offices used this printer before color inkjet plotters become popular liquid ink electrostatic printers were mostly available inches mm width also color printing these were also used print large billboards was first introduced by versatec which was later bought by xerox 3m also used make these printers plotters main article plotter calcomp drum plotter pen-based plotters were alternate printing technology once common engineering architectural firms pen-based plotters rely on contact with paper but not impact per se special purpose pens that are mechanically run over paper create text images since pens output continuous lines they were able produce technical drawings higher resolution than was achievable with dot-matrix technology some plotters used roll-fed paper therefore had minimal restriction on size output one dimension these plotters were capable producing quite sizable drawings other printers number other sorts printers are important for historical reasons for special purpose uses digital minilab photographic paper electrolytic printers spark printer barcode printer multiple technologies including thermal printing inkjet printing laser printing barcodes billboard / sign paint spray printers laser etching product packaging industrial printers microsphere special paper attributes printer control languages most printers other than line printers accept control characters unique character sequences control various printer functions these may range from shifting from lower upper case from black red ribbon on typewriter printers switching fonts changing character sizes colors on raster printers early printer controls were not standardized with each manufacturer's equipment having its own set ibm personal printer data stream ppds became

page yield page yield number pages that can be printed from toner cartridge ink cartridge—before cartridge needs be refilled replaced actual number pages yielded by specific cartridge depends on number factors for fair comparison many laser printer manufacturers use iso/iec process measure toner cartridge yield cost per page order fairly compare operating expenses printers with relatively small ink cartridge printers with larger more expensive toner cartridge that typically holds more toner so prints more pages before cartridge needs be replaced many people prefer estimate operating expenses terms cost per page cpp business model often razor blades business model applied that company may sell printer at cost make profits on ink cartridge paper some other replacement part this has caused legal disputes regarding right companies other than printer manufacturer sell compatible ink cartridges protect their business model several manufacturers invest heavily developing new cartridge technology patenting other manufacturers reaction challenges from using this business model choose make more money on printers less on ink promoting latter through their advertising campaigns finally this generates two clearly different proposals cheap printer – expensive ink expensive printer – cheap ink ultimately consumer decision depends on their reference interest rate their time preference from economics viewpoint there clear trade-off between cost per copy cost printer printer steganography illustration showing small yellow tracking dots on white paper generated by
