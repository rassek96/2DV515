sometimes simply executable binary causes computer perform indicated tasks according encoded instructions opposed data file that must be parsed by program be meaningful these instructions are traditionally machine code instructions for physical cpu however more general sense file containing instructions such bytecode for software interpreter may also be considered executable even scripting language source file may therefore be considered executable this sense exact interpretation depends upon use while term often refers only machine code files context protection against computer viruses all files which cause potentially hazardous instruction execution including scripts are lumped together for convenience executable code used describe sequences executable instructions that do not necessarily constitute executable file for example sections within program contents generation executable files interaction with computing platforms o hardware o operating system see also references external links generation executable files further information object file while executable file can be hand-coded machine language far more usual develop software source code high-level language easily understood by humans some cases assembly language more complex for humans but more closely associated with machine code instructions high-level language compiled into either executable machine code file non-executable machine-code object file some sort equivalent process on assembly language source code called assembly several object files are linked create executable object files executable not are typically container format such executable linkable format elf this structures generated machine code for example dividing into sections such text executable code data static variables rodata static constants order be executed by system such operating system firmware boot loader executable file must conform system's application binary interface abi most simply file executed by loading file into memory simply jumping start address space executing from there but more complicated interfaces executable files have additional metadata specifying separate entry point for example elf entry point specified header eentry field which specifies virtual memory address at which start execution gcc gnu compiler collection this field set by linker based on start symbol executable files typically also include runtime system which implements runtime language features such task scheduling exception handling calling static constructors destructors etc interactions with operating system notably passing arguments environment returning exit status together with other startup shutdown features such releasing resources like file handles for c this done by linking crt0 object which contains actual entry point does setup shutdown by calling runtime library executable files thus normally contain significant additional machine code beyond that directly generated from specific source code some cases desirable omit this for example for embedded systems development simply understand how compilation linking loading work c this can be done by omitting usual runtime instead explicitly specifying linker script which generates entry point handles startup shutdown such calling main start returning exit status kernel at end same source code can general be compiled run under different computer architectures operating systems sometimes this requires no changes source code simply outputting different machine code targeting different instruction set linking different runtime due operating system differences other cases this requires changing source code either including compile-time changes conditional compilation run-time changes checking environment at run time conversion existing source code for different platform called porting interaction with computing platforms hardware executable comprises machine code for particular processor family processors machine-code instructions for different families are completely different executables are totally incompatible within families processors may be backwards compatible for example x86-64 family processor can execute most code for x86 family processors from but converse not true some dependence on particular hardware such particular graphics card may be coded into executable usual far possible remove such dependencies from executable programs designed run on variety different hardware instead installing hardware-dependent device drivers on computer which program interacts with standardised way operating system some operating systems designate executable files by filename extension such exe provide indicator alongside file its metadata such by marking execute permission unix-like operating systems most operating systems also check that file that attempting run has valid executable file format safeguard against random bit sequences inadvertently being run instructions modern operating systems retain control over computer's resources requiring that individual programs make system calls access privileged resources since each operating system family features its own system call architecture executable files are generally produced for limited specific operating systems families operating systems however there are tools available that make executable files created for one operating system work on another through implementation similar compatible application binary interface one example piece software called wine which implements win32-compatible library for x86 processors other cases multiple executables created for different operating systems are packaged together fat binary order provide set options for purchaser user when binary interface hardware on which executable was compiled different from one attempting run program called emulator may translate from original binary interface one being used different files that can execute but do not necessarily conform specific hardware binary interface instruction set can be either represented bytecode for just-in-time compilation source code for use scripting language see shebang unix see also
