while she was working on mark ii computer at harvard university her associates discovered moth stuck relay thereby impeding operation whereupon she remarked that they were debugging system however term bug meaning technical error dates back at least thomas edison see software bug for full discussion debugging seems have been used term aeronautics before entering world computers indeed interview grace hopper remarked that she was not coining term moth fit already existing terminology so was saved letter from j robert oppenheimer director wwii atomic bomb manhattan project at los alamos nm used term letter dr ernest lawrence at uc berkeley dated october regarding recruitment additional technical staff oxford english dictionary entry for debug quotes term debugging used reference airplane engine testing article journal royal aeronautical society article airforce june p also refers debugging this time aircraft cameras hopper's bug was found on september term was not adopted by computer programmers until early 1950s seminal article by gill earliest in-depth discussion programming errors but does not use term bug debugging acm's digital library term debugging first used three papers from acm national meetings two three use term quotation marks by debugging was common enough term be mentioned passing without explanation on page ctss manual kidwell's article stalking elusive computer bug discusses etymology bug debug greater detail scope software electronic systems have become generally more complex various common debugging techniques have expanded with more methods detect anomalies assess impact schedule software patches full updates system words anomaly discrepancy can be used being more neutral terms avoid words error defect bug where there might be implication that all so-called errors defects bugs must be fixed at all costs instead impact assessment can be made determine if changes remove anomaly discrepancy would be cost-effective for system perhaps scheduled new release might render changes unnecessary not all issues are life-critical mission-critical system also important avoid situation where change might be more upsetting users long-term than living with known problems where cure would be worse than disease basing decisions acceptability some anomalies can avoid culture zero-defects mandate where people might be tempted deny existence problems so that result would appear zero defects considering collateral issues such cost-versus-benefit impact assessment then broader debugging techniques will expand determine frequency anomalies how often same bugs occur help assess their impact overall system tools debugging on video game consoles usually done with special hardware such this xbox debug unit intended only for developers see also debugger debugging ranges complexity from fixing simple errors performing lengthy tiresome tasks data collection analysis scheduling updates debugging skill programmer can be major factor ability debug problem but difficulty software debugging varies greatly with complexity system also depends some extent on programming languages used available tools such debuggers debuggers are software tools which enable programmer monitor execution program stop restart set breakpoints change values memory term debugger can also refer person who doing debugging generally high-level programming languages such java make debugging easier because they have features such exception handling that make real sources erratic behaviour easier spot programming languages such c assembly bugs may cause silent problems such memory corruption often difficult see where initial problem happened those cases memory debugger tools may be needed certain situations general purpose software tools that are language specific nature can be very useful these take form static code analysis tools these tools look for very specific set known problems some common some rare within source code all such issues detected by these tools would rarely be picked up by compiler interpreter thus they are not syntax checkers but more semantic checkers some tools claim be able detect 300+ unique problems both commercial free tools exist various languages these tools can be extremely useful when checking very large source trees where impractical do code walkthroughs typical example problem detected would be variable dereference that occurs before variable assigned value another example would be perform strong type checking when language does not require such thus they are better at locating likely errors versus actual errors result these tools have reputation false positives old unix lint program early example for debugging electronic hardware eg computer hardware well low-level software eg bioses device drivers firmware instruments such oscilloscopes logic analyzers in-circuit emulators ices are often used alone combination ice may perform many typical software debugger's tasks on low-level software firmware typical debugging process normally first step debugging attempt reproduce problem this can be non-trivial task for example with parallel processes some unusual software bugs also specific user environment usage history can make difficult reproduce problem after bug reproduced input program may need be simplified make easier debug for example bug compiler can make crash when parsing some large source file however after simplification test case only few lines from original source file can be sufficient reproduce same crash such simplification can be made manually using divide-and-conquer approach programmer will try remove some parts original test case check if problem still exists when debugging problem gui programmer can try skip some user interaction from original problem description check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs appear after test case sufficiently simplified programmer can use debugger tool examine program states values variables plus call stack track down origin problems alternatively tracing can be used simple cases tracing just few print statements which output values variables at certain points program execution techniques print debugging tracing act watching live recorded trace statements print statements that indicate flow execution process this sometimes called printf debugging due use printf function c this kind debugging was turned on by command tron original versions novice-oriented basic programming language tron stood for trace on tron caused line numbers each basic command line print program ran remote debugging process debugging program running on system different from debugger start remote debugging debugger connects remote system over network debugger can then control execution program on remote system retrieve information about its state post-mortem debugging debugging program after has already crashed related techniques often include various tracing techniques for example and/or analysis memory dump core dump crashed process dump process could be obtained automatically by system for example when process has terminated due unhandled exception by programmer-inserted instruction manually by interactive user wolf fence algorithm edward gauss described this simple but very useful now famous algorithm article for communications acm follows there's one wolf alaska how do you find first build fence down middle state wait for wolf howl determine which side fence on repeat process on that side only until you get point where you can see wolf this implemented eg git version control system command git bisect which uses above algorithm determine which commit introduced particular bug delta debugging – technique automating test case simplification p123 saff squeeze – technique isolating failure within test using progressive inlining parts failing test debugging for embedded systems contrast general purpose computer software design environment primary characteristic embedded environments sheer number different platforms available developers cpu architectures vendors operating systems their variants embedded systems are by definition not general-purpose designs they are typically developed for single task small range tasks platform chosen specifically optimize that application not only does this fact make life tough for embedded system developers also makes debugging testing these systems harder well since different debugging tools are needed different platforms identify fix bugs system eg logical synchronization problems code design error hardware collect information about operating states system that may then be used analyze system find ways boost its performance optimize other important characteristics eg energy consumption reliability real-time response etc anti-debugging anti-debugging implementation one more techniques within computer code that hinders attempts at reverse engineering debugging target process actively used by recognized publishers copy-protection schemas but also used by malware complicate its detection elimination techniques used anti-debugging include api-based check for existence debugger using system information exception-based check see if exceptions are interfered with process thread blocks check whether process thread blocks have been manipulated modified code check for code modifications made by debugger handling software breakpoints hardware- register-based check for hardware breakpoints cpu registers timing latency check time taken for execution instructions detecting penalizing debugger early
