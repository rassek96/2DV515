computer language used describe structure behavior electronic circuits most commonly digital logic circuits hardware description language enables precise formal description electronic circuit that allows for automated analysis simulation electronic circuit also allows for synthesis hdl description into netlist specification physical electronic components how they are connected together which can then be placed routed produce set masks used create integrated circuit hardware description language looks much like programming language such c textual description consisting expressions statements control structures one important difference between most programming languages hdls that hdls explicitly include notion time hdls form integral part electronic design automation eda systems especially for complex circuits such application-specific integrated circuits microprocessors programmable logic devices contents motivation structure hdl o comparison with control-flow languages history design using hdl simulating debugging hdl code design verification with hdls hdl programming languages high-level synthesis examples hdls o hdls for analog circuit design o hdls for digital circuit design o hdls for printed circuit board design see also references external links motivation due exploding complexity digital electronic circuits since 1970s see moore's law circuit designers needed digital logic descriptions be performed at high level without being tied specific electronic technology such cmos bjt hdls were created implement register-transfer level abstraction model data
