simula from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search this article about programming language for village estonia see simula estonia simula paradigm object-oriented designed by ole-johan dahl kristen nygaard first appeared influenced by algol influenced object-oriented programming languages simula name two simulation programming languages simula i simula developed 1960s at norwegian computing center oslo by ole-johan dahl kristen nygaard syntactically fairly faithful superset algol simula introduced objects2 classes133 inheritance subclasses221 virtual procedures223 coroutines92 discrete event simulation142 features garbage collection also other forms subtyping besides inheriting subclasses were introduced simula derivatives simula considered first object-oriented programming language its name suggests simula was designed for doing simulations needs that domain provided framework for many features object-oriented languages today simula has been used wide range applications such simulating vlsi designs process modeling protocols algorithms other applications such typesetting computer graphics education influence simula often understated simula-type objects are reimplemented c++ object pascal java c several other languages creator c++ bjarne stroustrup has acknowledged that simula was greatest influence on him develop c++ bring kind productivity enhancements offered by simula raw computational speed offered by lower level languages like bcpl contents history sample code o minimal program o classic hello world o classes subclasses virtual procedures o call by name o simulation see also notes sources further reading external links history following account based on jan rune holmevik's historical essay kristen nygaard started writing computer simulation programs nygaard saw need for better way describe heterogeneity operation system go further with his ideas on formal computer language for describing system nygaard realized that he needed someone with more computer programming skills than he had ole-johan dahl joined him on his work january decision linking language up algol was made shortly after by may main concepts for simulation language were set simula i was born special purpose programming language for simulating discrete event systems kristen nygaard was invited univac late may connection with marketing their new univac computer at that visit nygaard presented ideas simula robert bemer director systems programming at univac bemer was sworn algol fan found simula project compelling bemer was also chairing session at second international conference on information processing hosted by ifip he invited nygaard who presented paper simula -- extension algol description discrete-event networks norwegian computing center got univac august at considerable discount on which dahl implemented simula i under contract with univac implementation was based on univac algol compiler simula i was fully operational on univac by january following couple years dahl nygaard spent lot time teaching simula simula spread several countries around world simula i was later implemented on burroughs b5500 computers russian ural-16 computer c r hoare introduced concept record class construct which dahl nygaard extended with concept prefixing other features meet their requirements for generalized process concept dahl nygaard presented their paper on class subclass declarations at ifip working conference on simulation languages oslo may this paper became first formal definition simula june conference was held standardize language initiate number implementations dahl proposed unify type class concept this led serious discussions proposal was rejected by board simula was formally standardized on first meeting simula standards group ssg february simula was influential development smalltalk later object-oriented programming languages also helped inspire actor model concurrent computation although simula only supports co-routines not true concurrency late sixties early seventies there were four main implementations simula univac by ncc system/360 system/370 by ncc cdc by university oslo's joint computer installation at kjeller tops-10 by swedish national defence research institute foa these implementations were ported wide range platforms tops-10 implemented concept public protected private member variables procedures that later was integrated into simula simula latest standard ported wide range platforms there are mainly three implementations simula lund simula gnu cim november dahl nygaard were awarded ieee john von neumann medal by institute electrical electronic engineers for introduction concepts underlying object-oriented programming through design implementation simula february they received m turing award by association for computing machinery acm with citation for ideas fundamental emergence object oriented programming through their design programming languages simula i simula unfortunately neither dahl nor nygaard could make acm turing award lecture scheduled be delivered at oopsla conference seattle they both died within two months each other june august respectively simula research laboratory research institute named after simula language nygaard held part-time position there from opening new computer science building at university oslo named ole johan dahl's house after one two inventors simula main auditorium ole johan dahl's house named simula simula still used for various types university courses for instance jarek sklenar teaches simula students at university malta sample code minimal program empty computer file minimal program simula measured by size source code consists one thing only dummy statement however minimal program more conveniently represented empty block begin end begins executing immediately terminates language does not have any return value from program itself classic hello world example hello world program simula begin outtext hello world outimage end simula case-insensitive classes subclasses virtual procedures more realistic example with use classes133 subclasses virtual procedures223 begin class glyph virtual procedure print procedure print begin end glyph class char c character c begin procedure print outcharc end glyph class line elements ref glyph array elements begin procedure print begin integer i for i= step until upperbound elements do elements iprint outimage end end ref glyph rg ref glyph array rgs main program rgs 1- new char 'a' rgs 2- new char 'b' rgs 3- new char 'b' rgs 4- new char 'a' rg- new line rgs rgprint end above example has one super class glyph with two subclasses char line there one virtual procedure with two implementations execution starts by executing main program simula does not have concept abstract classes since classes with pure virtual procedures can be instantiated this means that above example all classes can be instantiated calling pure virtual procedure will however produce run-time error call by name simula supports call by name823 so jensen's device can easily be implemented however default transmission mode for simple parameter call by value contrary algol which used call by name source code for jensen's device must therefore specify call by name for parameters when compiled by simula compiler another much simpler example summation function ∑ {\displaystyle \sum } which can be implemented follows real procedure sigma k m n u name k u integer k m n real u begin real s k= m while k common base language norwegian computing center
