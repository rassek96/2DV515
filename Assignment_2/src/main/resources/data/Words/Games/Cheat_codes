disclaimers regarding player achievement cheating online games see also references history cheating video games has existed for almost their entire history first cheat codes were put place for play testing purposes playtesters had rigorously test mechanics game introduced cheat codes make this process easier early cheat code can be found manic miner where typing based on matthew smith's driving licence enables cheat mode within months wizardry proving grounds mad overlord's release at least two commercial trainers appeared advertisements for great escape utility similar product for castle wolfenstein promised that $15 product remodels every feature game stop startup delays crashes chest waiting get any item any quantity start any room at any rank handicap your aim even add items computer game all numerical values are stored memory gamers could reprogram small part game before launching context games for many 8-bit computers was usual practice load games into memory before launching them modify specific memory addresses order cheat getting unlimited number lives currency immunity invisibility etc such modifications were performed through poke statements commodore amstrad cpc range zx spectrum also allowed players with proper cartridges multiface add-on freeze running program enter pokes resume some games tried detect multiface refused load if was present earliest models had no ability hide later revisions either included switch hid if been opened closed menu before loading game automatically hid for instance with poke knight lore for zx spectrum immunity achieved magazines such crash regularly featured lists such poke instructions for games order find them hacker had interpret machine code locate critical point where number lives decreased impacts detected etc sometimes term poke was used with this specific meaning cheating was exploited by technology-oriented players due difficulty early cheats however cheat industry emerged gaming systems evolved through packaging selling cheating product cheat-enablers such cheat books game guides cheat cartridges helped form cheat industry cemented cheating part gaming culture however cheating was not universally accepted early gaming gaming magazine amiga power condemned cheaters taking stance that cheating was not part their philosophy fairness they also applied this reverse games should also not be allowed cheat player guides walkthroughs tutorials are sometimes used complete games but whether this cheating debatable if no cheat codes exploits glitches are used generally not considered be cheating by hardcore gaming community player receiving help that will improve their gameplay performance opposed gaining unfair in-game advantage later cheating grew more popular with magazines websites even television show cheat dedicated listing cheats walkthroughs for consoles computer systems poke cheats were replaced by trainers cheat codes generally majority cheat codes on modern day systems are implemented not by gamers but by game developers some say that many people do not have time complete video game on their own cheats are needed make game more accessible appealing casual gamer with rise popularity gaming cheating using external software hardware raised number copyright legal issues related modifying game code many modern games have removed cheat codes entirely except when used unlock certain secret bonuses usage real-time achievement tracking made unfair for any one player cheat online multiplayer games cheating frowned upon disallowed often leading ban however certain games may unlock single-player cheats if player fulfills certain condition yet other games such those using source engine allow developer consoles be used activate wide variety cheats single-player by server administrators many games which use in-game purchases consider cheating be not only wrong but also illegal seeing cheats such games would allow players access content like power-ups extra coins that would otherwise require payment obtain however cheating such games nonetheless legal grey area because there are no laws against modifying software which already owned detailed digital millennium copyright act cheat codes most basic type cheat code one created by game designers hidden within video game itself that will cause any type uncommon effect that not part usual game mechanics cheat codes are usually activated by typing secret passwords pressing controller buttons certain sequence some games may also offer debug console that can be used edit game parameters effects might include unlocking character improving character's performance for example providing car with greater acceleration entering god mode noclip mode visual gags with no practical purpose such tutu qwark ratchet & clank up your arsenal unlike other cheating methods cheat codes are implemented by game developers themselves often tool playtest certain aspects game without difficulty one earliest known examples this type cheat konami code created by konami developer kazuhisa hashimoto he worked on porting arcade game gradius for use on nintendo entertainment system hashimoto quoted saying arcade version gradius really difficult right i never played that much there was no way i could finish game so i inserted so-called konami code bots online game there are methods called bots robots which are programs that emulate human behavior through which prevents player perform actions repetitive not that enable achieve advantages according bot therefore they differ from ones mentioned before because human intervention not required for their execution we can distinguish into two main categories macro are very simple normal bots that execute combination keyboard keys simulate movement mouse according predefined schemes opposition them real bots with artificial intelligence which are able learn respond various inputs game itself even without default scheme latter one thanks their versatility performance because they very often work at memory level have been favored by cheaters even if they are more complex develop among examples we can mention for famous game fifa ultimate team which autobuyer type bots category bots that are designed achieve receivables through sale purchase methods capital gain are massively influencing market outcome this makes often difficult purchase at favorable prices players / item humans this system from few key aspects speed execution correct order magnitude this case milliseconds for bots seconds for humans ability run multithreading code not least key factor that bot by its very nature does not need take breaks thus can operate indefinitely on ongoing basis modification runtime game data cheating can easily be achieved by modifying game's data while running these methods cheating are often less reliable than cheat codes included game by its creators this due fact that certain programming styles quirks internal game logic different release versions game even using same game at different times on different hardware may result different memory usage hence trainer program might have no effect stop game from running altogether modifying game data usually constitutes violation software license agreement that prohibits modifying program at all game genie for nes allows player insert codes edit game's memory values memory editing cheating via memory editing involves modifying memory values where game keeps its status information way achieve this will vary depending on environment which game running memory editing hardware main article cheat cartridge cheat cartridge attached interface port on home computer console allows user modify game code either before during its execution early example multiface for zx spectrum almost every format since has had cheat cartridge created for such datel's range action replay devices another popular example this game genie for genesis nes super nes game boy game gear game consoles modern disc-based cheat hardware include gameshark code breaker which modify game code from large database cheats later generation consoles cheat cartridges have come be replaced by cheat discs containing simple loader program which loads game disc modifies main executable before starting legality this type devices has been questioned having raised particular case named lewis galoob toys inc v nintendo america inc which nintendo unsuccessfully sued lewis galoob toys stating that its cheating device game genie created derivative works games thus violated copyright law memory editing software main article trainer games most basic way achieving this by means memory editor software which allows player directly edit numeric values certain memory address this kind software usually includes feature that allows player perform memory searches aid user locate memory areas where known values such amount lives score health level are located provided memory address memory editor may also be able freeze preventing game from altering information stored at that memory address game trainers are special type memory editor which program comes with predefined functions modify run time memory specific computer game when distributed trainers often have single + number appended their title representing number modifications trainer has available 1980s 1990s trainers were generally integrated straight into actual game by cracking groups when game was first started trainer would typically show splash screen its own sometimes allowing modifications options related trainer then proceed actual game cracker group release lists intros trained games were marked with one more plus signs after them one for each option trainer for example mega krew presents ms astro chicken++ many emulators have built-in functionality that allows players modify data game running sometimes even emulating cheating hardware such game genie some emulators take this method step further allow player export import data edits edit templates many games for console are collected redistributed cheat packs emulators also frequently offer additional advantage being able save state entire emulated machine at any point effectively allowing saving at any point game even when save functionality not provided by game itself cheating hardware such instant replay also allows such behavior for some consoles code injection somewhat more unusual than memory editing code injection consists modification game's executable code while running for example with use poke commands case jet set willy on zx spectrum computer popular cheat involved replacing z80 instruction dec hl program which was responsible for decrementing number lives by one with nop effectively granting player infinite lives saved game editors editing saved game offers indirect way modify game data by modifying file persistent storage possible effectively modify run time game data that will be restored when game attempts load save game hex editors were most basic means editing saved game files eg give player large sum money strategy games such dune ii however happened with game editors dedicated game-editing utilities soon became available including functions effortlessly edit saved data for specific games rendering hex editing largely obsolete for this purpose if saved game stored multiple files may also be possible cheat simply by mixing matching these files for example if one file represents items treasure chest while another represents player's inventory then player can save game before after picking up item from chest continue play using treasure chest file before item was picked up inventory file from afterward network traffic forgery similar method for cheating online games involves editing packets modify outbound network traffic thus affecting state game although this was more common past modern games are developed with robustness against network packet modifications terms service for most games explicitly forbid this form cheating unusual effects cheat codes may sometimes produce unusual interesting effects which don't necessarily make game easier play for example one cheat jurassic park operation genesis makes dinosaurs appear undead another example occurs game dungeon siege where activating cheat extend range bow also allows enemies fire at same distance thereby eliminating advantage cheat would have given cheat may even make game harder play for instance one could give enemy special abilities increase general difficulty make neutral bystanders attack player grant player disadvantage such low health points cheats grand theft auto games can make npcs start rioting wield weapons grand theft auto iii player can activate cheat enable blowing off limbs npcs feature originally included game recently however rockstar games has not included such violent unusual cheat codes its games instead choosing focus on cheats such vehicle spawns
