glitch from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search for other uses see glitch disambiguation glitch short-lived fault system often used describe transient fault that corrects itself therefore difficult troubleshoot term particularly common computing electronics industries circuit bending well among players video games although applied all types systems including human organizations nature there no consensus on exact difference between glitch bug but general video game culture glitch sometimes defined error with only slightly game affecting nature by altering game's visuals audio mechanics possibly temporarily while bug would be genuine functionality-breaking problem alex pieschel writing for arcade review said there currently no real consensus on difference between terms “glitch” “bug” general internet nomenclature both words refer errors that work against authorial intent but “bug” often cast weightier more blameworthy pejorative while “glitch” suggests something more mysterious unknowable inflicted by surprise inputs stuff outside realm code often terms are used interchangeably — alex pieschel glitches kind history december contents etymology

house's american slang claim that term comes from german word glitschen slip yiddish word gletshn slide skid either way relatively new term was first widely defined for american people by bennett cerf on june episode what's my line kink when anything goes wrong down there they say there's been slight glitch john daly further defined word on july episode same show saying that it's term used by air force at cape kennedy process launching rockets means something's gone wrong you can't figure out what so you call glitch later on july time magazine felt necessary define article glitches—a spaceman's word for irritating disturbances relation reference by time magazine term has been believed enter common usage during american space race 1950s where was used describe minor faults rocket hardware that were difficult pinpoint electronics glitch electronics glitch undesired transition that occurs before signal settles its intended value other words glitch electrical pulse short duration that usually result fault design error particularly digital circuit for example many electronic components such flip-flops are triggered by pulse that must not be shorter than specified minimum duration otherwise component may malfunction pulse shorter than specified minimum called glitch related concept runt pulse pulse whose amplitude smaller than minimum level specified for correct operation spike short pulse similar glitch but often caused by ringing crosstalk glitch can occur presence race condition poorly designed digital logic circuit computer glitch computer glitch failure system usually containing computing device complete its functions perform them properly public declarations glitch used suggest minor fault which will soon be rectified therefore used euphemism for bug which factual statement that programming fault blame for system failure frequently refers error which not detected at time occurs but shows up later data errors incorrect human decisions situations which are frequently called computer glitches are incorrectly written software software bugs incorrect instructions given by operator operator errors failure account for this possibility might also be considered software bug undetected invalid input data this might also be considered software bug undetected communications errors computer viruses trojan attacks computer exploiting sometimes called hacking such glitches could produce problems such keyboard malfunction number key failures screen abnormalities turned left right upside-down random program malfunctions abnormal program registering examples computer glitches causing disruption include unexpected shutdown water filtration plant new canaan failures computer aided dispatch system used by police austin resulting unresponded calls unexpected bit flip causing cassini spacecraft enter safe mode november glitches can also be costly bank was unable raise interest rates for weeks resulting losses more than million dollars per day video game glitches see also software bug glitching start-up screen virtual boy affected by visual glitch glitches/bugs are software errors that can cause drastic problems within code typically go unnoticed unsolved during production said software these errors can be game caused otherwise exploited until developer/development team repairs them complex software rarely bug-free otherwise free from errors upon first release texture/model glitches are kind bug other error that causes any specific model texture either become distorted otherwise not look intended by developers bethesda's elder scrolls v skyrim notorious for texture glitches well other errors that affect many company's popular titles many games that use ragdoll physics for their character models can have such glitches happen them physics glitches are errors game's physics engine that causes specific entity be physics object npc non-player character be unintentionally moved some degree these kinds errors can be exploited unlike many chance physics error happening can either be entirely random accidentally caused sound glitches are which there error with game's sound these can range from sounds playing when not intended play even not playing at all occasionally certain sound will loop otherwise player will be given option continuously play sound when not intended often games will play sounds incorrectly due corrupt data altering values predefined code examples include but are not limited extremely high low pitched sounds volume being mute too high understand also rarely even playing reverse order/playing reversed glitches may include incorrectly displayed graphics collision detection errors game freezes/crashes sound errors other issues graphical glitches are especially notorious platforming games where malformed textures can directly affect gameplay for example by displaying ground texture where code calls for area that should damage character by not displaying wall texture where there should be one resulting invisible wall some glitches are potentially dangerous game's stored data glitching practice players exploiting faults video game's programming achieve tasks that give them unfair advantage game over npc's other players such running through walls defying game's physics glitches can be deliberately induced certain home video game consoles by manipulating game medium such tilting rom cartridge disconnect one more connections along edge connector interrupt part flow data between cartridge console this can result graphic music gameplay errors doing this however carries risk crashing game even causing permanent damage game medium heavy use glitches are used performing speedrun video game one type glitch often used for speedrunning stack overflow which referred overflowing another type speedrunning glitch which almost impossible do by humans mostly made use tool assisted speedruns arbitrary code execution which will cause object game do something outside its intended function part quality assurance process performed by game testers for video games locating reproducing glitches then compiling reports on glitches be fed back programmers so that they can repair bugs certain games have cloud-type system for updates software that can be used repair coding faults other errors games television glitch broadcasting corrupted signal may glitch form jagged lines on screen misplaced squares static looking effects freezing problems inverted colors glitches may affect video and/or audio usually audio dropout transmission these glitches may be caused by variety issues interference from portable electronics microwaves damaged cables at broadcasting center weather popular culture multiple works popular culture deal with glitches those with word
