surfaces such systems tend be one-way meaning external forces applied aerodynamically control surfaces are not perceived at controls here missing normal forces are simulated with springs weights lighter aircraft without servo systems aircraft approached stall aerodynamic buffeting vibrations was felt pilot's controls this was useful warning dangerous flight condition this control shake not felt when servo control systems are used replace this missing sensory cue angle attack measured when approaches critical stall point stick shaker engaged which simulates response simpler control system alternatively servo force may be measured signal directed servo system on control known force feedback force feedback has been implemented experimentally some excavators useful when excavating mixed material such large rocks embedded silt clay allows operator feel work around unseen obstacles enabling significant increases productivity less risk damage machine first us patent for tactile telephone was granted thomas d shannon early tactile man-machine communication system was constructed by michael noll at bell telephone laboratories inc early 1970s patent issued for his invention aura interactor vest aura systems launched interactor vest wearable force-feedback device that monitors audio signal uses aura's patented electromagnetic actuator technology convert bass sound waves into vibrations that can represent such actions punch kick interactor vest plugs into audio output stereo tv vcr user provided with controls that allow for adjusting intensity vibration filtering out high frequency sounds interactor vest worn over upper torso audio signal reproduced through speaker embedded vest after selling its interactor vest aura began shipping interactor cushion device which operates like vest but instead being worn it's placed against seat back user must lean against both vest cushion were launched with price tag $99 jensen's tap-in device norwegian geir jensen described wrist watch haptic device with skin tap mechanism termed tap-in would connect mobile phone via blueteooth tapping-frequency patterns would identify callers mobile enable wearer respond by selected short messages was submitted for governmental innovation contest received no award was not pursued published until recovered tap-in device by jensen was devised facing user avoid twisting wrist see image would adapt across all mobile phone watch brands apple started sell wrist watch which included skin tap sensing notifications alerts mobile phone watch wearer commercial applications tactile electronic displays tactile electronic display kind display device that presents information tactile form teleoperators simulators teleoperators are remote controlled robotic tools—when contact forces are reproduced operator called haptic teleoperation first electrically actuated teleoperators were built 1950s at argonne national laboratory by raymond goertz remotely handle radioactive substances since then use force feedback has become more widespread other kinds teleoperators such remote controlled underwater exploration devices when such devices are simulated using computer they are operator training devices useful provide force feedback that would be felt actual operations since objects being manipulated do not exist physical sense forces are generated using haptic force generating operator controls data representing touch sensations may be saved played back using such haptic technologies haptic simulators are used medical simulators flight simulators for pilot training very critical exert proper force magnitude user requires considering human force sensitivity video games haptic feedback commonly used arcade games especially racing video games sega's
