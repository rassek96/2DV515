that not text sound typically term computer graphics refers several different things representation manipulation image data by computer various technologies used create manipulate images sub-field computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing manipulating visual content see study computer graphics computer graphics widespread today computer imagery found on television newspapers for example weather reports for example all kinds medical investigation surgical procedures well-constructed graph can present complex statistics form that easier understand interpret media such graphs are used illustrate papers reports thesis other presentation material many powerful tools have been developed visualize data computer generated imagery can be categorized into several different types two dimensional three dimensional animated graphics technology has improved computer graphics have become more common but computer graphics are still widely used computer graphics has emerged sub-field computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing manipulating visual content over past decade other specialized fields have been developed like information visualization scientific visualization more concerned with visualization three dimensional phenomena architectural meteorological medical biological etc where emphasis on realistic renderings volumes surfaces illumination sources so forth perhaps with dynamic time component history see also history computer animation introduction precursor sciences development modern computer graphics were advances electrical engineering electronics television that took place during first half twentieth century screens could display art since lumiere brothers' use mattes create special effects for earliest films dating from but such displays were limited not interactive first cathode ray tube braun tube was invented - turn would permit oscilloscope military control panel - more direct precursors field they provided first two-dimensional electronic displays that responded programmatic user input nevertheless computer graphics remained relatively unknown discipline until 1950s post-world war ii period - during which time discipline emerged from combination both pure university laboratory academic research into more advanced computers united states military's further development technologies like radar advanced aviation rocketry developed during war new kinds displays were needed process wealth information resulting from such projects leading development computer graphics discipline 1950s sage sector control room early projects like whirlwind sage projects introduced crt viable display interaction interface introduced light pen input device douglas t ross whirlwind sage system performed personal experiment which small program he wrote captured movement his finger displayed its vector his traced name on display scope one first interactive video games feature recognizable interactive graphics – tennis for two – was created for oscilloscope by william higinbotham entertain visitors at brookhaven national laboratory simulated tennis match douglas t ross innovated again while working at mit on transforming mathematic statements into computer generated machine tool vectors took opportunity create display scope image disney cartoon character electronics pioneer hewlett-packard went public after incorporating decade prior established strong ties with stanford university through its founders who were alumni this began decades-long transformation southern san francisco bay area into world's leading computer technology hub - now known silicon valley field computer graphics developed with emergence computer graphics hardware further advances computing led greater advancements interactive computer graphics tx-2 computer was developed at mit's lincoln laboratory tx-2 integrated number new man-machine interfaces light pen could be used draw sketches on computer using ivan sutherland's revolutionary sketchpad software using light pen sketchpad allowed one draw simple shapes on computer screen save them even recall them later light pen itself had small photoelectric cell its tip this cell emitted electronic pulse whenever was placed front computer screen screen's electron gun fired directly at by simply timing electronic pulse with current location electron gun was easy pinpoint exactly where pen was on screen at any given moment once that was determined computer could then draw cursor at that location sutherland seemed find perfect solution for many graphics problems he faced even today many standards computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early sketchpad program one example this drawing constraints if one wants draw square for example they do not have worry about drawing four lines perfectly form edges box one can simply specify that they want draw box then specify location size box software will then construct perfect box with right dimensions at right location another example that sutherland's software modeled objects - not just picture objects other words with model car one could change size tires without affecting rest car could stretch body car without deforming tires 1960s spacewar running on computer history museum's pdp-1 phrase “computer graphics” itself was coined by william fetter graphic designer for boeing this old quote many secondary sources comes complete with following sentence fetter has said that terms were actually given him by verne hudson wichita division boeing another student at mit steve russell created second video game spacewar written for dec pdp-1 spacewar was instant success copies started flowing other pdp-1 owners eventually dec got copy engineers at dec used diagnostic program on every new pdp-1 before shipping sales force picked up on this quickly enough when installing new units would run world's first video game for their new customers higginbotham's tennis for two had beaten spacewar by almost three years but was almost unknown outside research academic setting e e zajac scientist at bell telephone laboratory btl created film called simulation two-giro gravity attitude control system this computer-generated film zajac showed how attitude satellite could be altered orbits earth he created animation on ibm mainframe computer also at btl ken knowlton frank sinden michael noll started working computer graphics field sinden created film called force mass motion illustrating newton's laws motion operation around same time other scientists were creating computer graphics illustrate their research at lawrence radiation laboratory nelson max created films flow viscous fluid propagation shock waves solid form boeing aircraft created film called vibration aircraft also sometime early 1960s automobiles would also provide boost through early work pierre bézier at renault who used paul de casteljau's curves - now called bézier curves after bézier's work field - develop modeling techniques for renault car bodies these curves would form foundation for much curve-modeling work field curves - unlike polygons - are mathematically complex entities draw model well pong arcade version was not long before major corporations started taking interest computer graphics trw lockheed-georgia general electric sperry rand are among many companies that were getting started computer graphics by mid-1960s ibm was quick respond this interest by releasing ibm graphics terminal first commercially available graphics computer ralph baer supervising engineer at sanders associates came up with home video game that was later licensed magnavox called odyssey while very simplistic requiring fairly inexpensive electronic parts allowed player move points light around on screen was first consumer computer graphics product david c evans was director engineering at bendix corporation's computer division from after which he worked for next five years visiting professor at berkeley there he continued his interest computers how they interfaced with people university utah recruited evans form computer science program computer graphics quickly became his primary interest this new department would become world's primary research center for computer graphics also ivan sutherland continued innovate at mit when he invented first computer controlled head-mounted display hmd called sword damocles because hardware required for support displayed two separate wireframe images one for each eye this allowed viewer see computer scene stereoscopic after receiving his phd from mit sutherland became director information processing at arpa advanced research projects agency later became professor at harvard sutherland was recruited by evans join computer science program at university utah - development which would turn that department into one most important research centers graphics for nearly decade thereafter eventually producing some most important pioneers field there sutherland perfected his hmd twenty years later nasa would re-discover his techniques their virtual reality research at utah sutherland evans were highly sought after consultants by large companies but they were frustrated at lack graphics hardware available at time so they started formulating plan start their own company arthur appel described first algorithm for what would eventually become known ray casting - basis point for almost all modern graphics well later pursuit photorealism graphics acm initiated special interest group on graphics siggraph which organizes conferences graphics standards publications within field computer graphics by first annual siggraph conference was held which has become one focuses organization siggraph has grown size importance field computer graphics has expanded over time 1970s utah teapot by martin newell its static renders became emblematic cgi development during 1970s many most important early breakthroughs transformation graphics from utilitarian realistic occurred at university utah 1970s which had hired ivan sutherland away from mit sutherland's graphics class would contribute number significant pioneers field including student by name edwin catmull - later founder pixar because david c evans' sutherland's presence uu was gaining quite reputation place be for computer graphics research so catmull went there learn animation catmull had just come from boeing company had been working on his degree physics growing up on disney catmull loved animation yet quickly discovered that he did not have talent for drawing now catmull along with many others saw computers natural progression animation they wanted be part revolution first animation that catmull saw was his own he created animation his hand opening closing became one his goals produce feature-length motion picture using computer graphics same class fred parke created animation his wife's face uu computer graphics laboratory was attracting people from all over john warnock was one those early pioneers he would later found adobe systems create revolution publishing world with his postscript page description language adobe would go on later create industry standard photo editing software adobe photoshop movie industry's special effects standard adobe after effects tom stockham led image processing group at uu which worked closely with computer graphics lab jim clark was also there he would later found silicon graphics first major advance computer graphics was created at uu by these early pioneers hidden-surface algorithm order draw representation object on screen computer must determine which surfaces are behind object from viewer's perspective thus should be hidden when computer creates renders image core graphics system core was first graphical standard be developed group experts acm special interest group siggraph developed this conceptual framework specifications were published became foundation for many future developments field also 1970s henri gouraud jim blinn bui tuong phong contributed foundations shading cgi via development gouraud shading blinn-phong shading models allowing graphics move beyond flat look look more accurately portraying depth jim blinn also innovated further by introducing bump mapping technique for simulating uneven surfaces predecessor many more advanced kinds mapping used today modern videogame arcade known today was birthed 1970s with first arcade games using real-time sprite graphics pong was one first hit arcade cabinet games speed race featured sprites moving along vertically scrolling road gun fight featured human-looking sprite character graphics while space invaders featured large number sprites on screen both used intel microprocessor fujitsu mb14241 video shifter accelerate drawing sprite graphics 1980s dire straits' music video for their hit song money for nothing - i want my mtv song – became known early example fully three-dimensional animated computer-generated imagery 1980s began see modernization commercialization computer graphics home computer proliferated subject which had previously been academics-only discipline was adopted by much larger audience number computer graphics developers increased significantly early 1980s availability bit-slice 16-bit microprocessors started revolutionise high-resolution computer graphics terminals which now increasingly became intelligent semi-standalone standalone workstations graphics application processing were increasingly migrated intelligence workstation rather than continuing rely on central mainframe mini-computers typical early move high resolution computer graphics intelligent workstations for computer-aided engineering market were orca workstations developed by orcatech ottawa spin-off from bell-northern research led by david pearson early workstation pioneer orca was based on motorola amd bit-slice processors had unix its operating system was targeted squarely at sophisticated end design engineering sector artists graphic designers began see personal computer particularly commodore amiga macintosh serious design tool one that could save time draw more accurately than other methods macintosh remains highly popular tool for computer graphics among graphic design studios businesses modern computers dating from 1980s often use graphical user interfaces gui present data information with symbols icons pictures rather than text graphics are one five key elements multimedia technology field realistic rendering japan's osaka university developed links-1 computer graphics system supercomputer that used up zilog z8001 microprocessors for purpose rendering realistic computer graphics according information processing society japan core image rendering calculating luminance each pixel making up rendered surface from given viewpoint light source object position links-1 system was developed realize image rendering methodology which each pixel could be parallel processed independently using ray tracing by developing new software methodology specifically for high-speed image rendering links-1 was able rapidly render highly realistic images was used create world's first planetarium-like video entire heavens that was made completely with computer graphics video was presented at fujitsu pavilion at international exposition tsukuba links-1 was world's most powerful computer also field realistic rendering general rendering equation david immel james kajiya was developed - important step towards implementing global illumination which necessary pursue photorealism computer graphics continuing popularity star wars other science fiction franchises were relevant cinematic cgi at this time lucasfilm industrial light & magic became known go-to house by many other studios for topnotch computer graphics film important advances chroma keying bluescreening etc were made for later films original trilogy two other pieces video would also outlast era historically relevant dire straits' iconic near-fully-cgi video for their song money for nothing which popularized cgi among music fans that era scene from young sherlock holmes same year featuring first fully cgi character feature movie animated stained-glass knight first shaders - small programs designed specifically do shading separate algorithm - were developed by pixar which had already spun off from industrial light & magic separate entity - though public would not see results such technological progress until next decade late 1980s sgi computers were used create some first fully computer-generated short films at pixar silicon graphics machines were considered high-water mark for field during decade 1980s also called golden era videogames millions-selling systems from atari nintendo sega among other companies exposed computer graphics for first time new young impressionable audience - did ms-dos-based personal computers apple iis macs amigas which also allowed users program their own games if skilled enough demoscenes shareware games proliferated john carmack later innovator would start out this period developing sprite-based games arcades advances were made commercial real-time graphics first dedicated real-time graphics boards were introduced arcades with namco system taito air system this innovation would be precursor later home graphics processing unit gpu technology where separate very powerful chip used parallel processing with cpu optimize graphics 1990s quarxs series poster maurice benayoun françois schuiten 1990s' overwhelming note was emergence modeling on mass scale impressive rise quality cgi generally home computers became able take on rendering tasks that previously had been limited workstations costing thousands dollars modelers became available for home systems popularity silicon graphics workstations declined powerful microsoft windows apple macintosh machines running autodesk products like studio other home rendering software ascended importance by end decade gpu would begin its rise prominence still enjoys today field began see first rendered graphics that could truly pass photorealistic untrained eye though they could not yet do so with trained cgi artist graphics became far more popular gaming multimedia animation at end 1980s beginning nineties were created france very first computer graphics tv series la vie des bêtes by studio mac guff ligne les fables géométriques 1989-1991 by studio fantôme quarxs first hdtv computer graphics series by maurice benayoun françois schuiten studio z-a production 1990–1993 film pixar began its serious commercial rise this era under edwin catmull with its first major film release - toy story - critical commercial success nine-figure magnitude studio invent programmable shader would go on have many animated hits its work on prerendered video animation still considered industry leader research trailbreaker videogames virtua racing running on sega model arcade system board laid foundations for fully racing games popularized real-time polygonal graphics among wider audience video game industry sega model sega model subsequently pushed boundaries commercial real-time graphics back on pc wolfenstein doom quake three first massively popular first-person shooter games were released by id software critical popular acclaim during this decade using rendering engine innovated primarily by john carmack sony playstation nintendo among other consoles sold millions popularized graphics for home gamers certain late-90's first-generation titles became seen influential popularizing graphics among console users such platform games super mario legend zelda ocarina time early fighting games like virtua fighter battle arena toshinden tekken technology algorithms for rendering continued improve greatly krishnamurty levoy invented normal mapping - improvement on jim blinn's bump mapping saw nvidia release seminal geforce first home video card billed graphics processing unit gpu which its own words contained integrated transform lighting triangle setup/clipping rendering engines by end decade computers adopted common frameworks for graphics processing such directx opengl since then computer graphics have only become more detailed realistic due more powerful graphics hardware modeling software amd also became leading developer graphics boards this decade creating duopoly field which exists this day 2000s ] this section needs expansion you can help by adding october still from final fantasy spirits within cgi became ubiquitous earnest during this era video games cgi cinema had spread reach computer graphics mainstream by late 1990s continued do so at accelerated pace 2000s cgi was also adopted en masse for television advertisements widely late 1990s 2000s so became familiar massive audience continued rise increasing sophistication graphics processing unit was crucial this decade rendering capabilities became standard feature 3d-graphics gpus became considered necessity for desktop computer makers offer nvidia geforce line graphics cards dominated market early decade with occasional significant competing presence from ati decade progressed even low-end machines usually contained 3d-capable gpu some kind nvidia amd both introduced low-priced chipsets continued dominate market shaders which had been introduced 1980s perform specialized processing on gpu would by end decade become supported on most consumer hardware speeding up graphics considerably allowing for greatly improved texture shading computer graphics via widespread adoption normal mapping bump mapping variety other techniques allowing simulation great amount detail computer graphics used films video games gradually began be realistic point entering uncanny valley cgi movies proliferated with traditional animated cartoon films like ice age madagascar well numerous pixar offerings like finding nemo dominating box office this field final fantasy spirits within released was first fully computer-generated feature film use photorealistic cgi characters be fully made with motion capture film was not box-office success however some commentators have suggested this may be partly because lead cgi characters had facial features which fell into uncanny valley other animated films like polar express drew attention at this time well star wars also resurfaced with its prequel trilogy

active gaming platforms well image types two-dimensional main article computer graphics see also video display controller raster graphic sprites left masks right computer graphics are computer-based generation digital images —mostly from models such digital image by techniques specific them computer graphics are mainly used applications that were originally developed upon traditional printing drawing technologies such typography those applications two-dimensional image not just representation real-world object but independent artifact with added semantic value two-dimensional models are therefore preferred because they give more direct control image than computer graphics whose approach more akin photography than typography pixel art see also pixel art large form digital art being pixel art created through use raster graphics software where images are edited on pixel level graphics most old relatively limited computer video games graphing calculator games many mobile phone games are mostly pixel art sprite graphics see also sprite computer graphics sprite two-dimensional image animation that integrated into larger scene initially including just graphical objects handled separately from memory bitmap video display this now includes various manners graphical overlays originally sprites were method integrating unrelated bitmaps so that they appeared be part normal bitmap on screen such creating animated character that can be moved on screen without altering data defining overall screen such sprites can be created by either electronic circuitry software circuitry hardware sprite hardware construct that employs custom dma channels integrate visual elements with main screen that super-imposes two discrete video sources software can simulate this through specialized rendering methods vector graphics see also vector graphics example showing effect vector graphics versus raster bitmap graphics vector graphics formats are complementary raster graphics raster graphics representation images array pixels typically used for representation photographic images vector graphics consists encoding information about shapes colors that comprise image which can allow for more flexibility rendering there are instances when working with vector tools formats best practice instances when working with raster tools formats best practice there are times when both formats come together understanding advantages limitations each technology relationship between them most likely result efficient effective use tools three-dimensional main article computer graphics see also graphics processing unit graphics compared graphics are graphics that use three-dimensional representation geometric data for purpose performance this stored computer this includes images that may be for later display for real-time viewing despite these differences computer graphics rely on similar algorithms computer graphics do frame raster graphics like final rendered display computer graphics software distinction between occasionally blurred applications may use techniques achieve effects such lighting primarily may use rendering techniques computer graphics are same models model contained within graphical data file apart from rendering however there are differences that include model representation any object until visually displayed model not graphic due printing models are not only confined virtual space rendering how model can be displayed also can be used non-graphical computer simulations calculations computer animation see also computer animation example computer animation produced using motion capture fractal landscape example computer-generated imagery computer animation art creating moving images via use computers subfield computer graphics animation increasingly created by means computer graphics though computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic low bandwidth faster real-time rendering needs sometimes target animation computer itself but sometimes target another medium such film also referred cgi computer-generated imagery computer-generated imaging especially when used films virtual entities may contain be controlled by assorted attributes such transform values location orientation scale stored object's transformation matrix animation change attribute over time multiple methods achieving animation exist rudimentary form based on creation editing keyframes each storing value at given time per attribute be animated 2d/3d graphics software will change with each keyframe creating editable curve value mapped over time which results animation other methods animation include procedural expression-based techniques former consolidates related elements animated entities into sets attributes useful for creating particle effects crowd simulations latter allows evaluated result returned from user-defined logical expression coupled with mathematics automate animation predictable way convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what hierarchy offers skeletal system set up create illusion movement image displayed on computer screen then quickly replaced by new image that similar previous image but shifted slightly this technique identical illusion movement television motion pictures concepts principles images are typically created by devices such cameras mirrors lenses telescopes microscopes etc digital images include both vector images raster images but raster images are more commonly used pixel enlarged portion image individual pixels are rendered squares can be easily seen digital imaging pixel picture element single point raster image pixels are placed on regular 2-dimensional grid are often represented using dots squares each pixel sample original image where more samples typically provide more accurate representation original intensity each pixel variable color systems each pixel has typically three components such red green blue graphics graphics are visual presentations on surface such computer screen examples are photographs drawing graphics designs maps engineering drawings other images graphics often combine text illustration graphic design may consist deliberate selection creation arrangement typography alone brochure flier poster web site book without any other element clarity effective communication may be objective association with other cultural elements may be sought merely creation distinctive style primitives primitives are basic units which graphics system may combine create more complex images models examples would be sprites character maps video games geometric primitives cad polygons triangles rendering primitives may be supported hardware for efficient rendering building blocks provided by graphics application rendering rendering generation image from model by means computer programs scene file contains objects strictly defined language data structure would contain geometry viewpoint texture lighting shading information description virtual scene data contained scene file then passed rendering program be processed output digital image raster graphics image file rendering program usually built into computer graphics software though others are available plug-ins entirely separate programs term rendering may be by analogy with artist's rendering scene though technical details rendering methods vary general challenges overcome producing image from representation stored scene file are outlined graphics pipeline along rendering device such gpu gpu device able assist cpu calculations if scene look relatively realistic predictable under virtual lighting rendering software should solve rendering equation rendering equation does not account for all lighting phenomena but general lighting model for computer-generated imagery 'rendering' also used describe process calculating effects video editing file produce final video output projection projection method mapping three dimensional points two dimensional plane most current methods for displaying graphical data are based on planar two dimensional media use this type projection widespread especially computer graphics engineering drafting ray tracing ray tracing technique for generating image by tracing path light through pixels image plane technique capable producing very high degree photorealism usually higher than that typical scanline rendering methods but at greater computational cost shading example shading shading refers depicting depth models illustrations by varying levels darkness process used drawing for depicting levels darkness on paper by applying media more densely with darker shade for darker areas less densely with lighter shade for lighter areas there are various techniques shading including cross hatching where perpendicular lines varying closeness are drawn grid pattern shade area closer lines are together darker area appears likewise farther apart lines are lighter area appears term has been recently generalized mean that shaders are applied texture mapping texture mapping method for adding detail surface texture colour computer-generated graphic model its application graphics was pioneered by dr edwin catmull texture map applied mapped surface shape polygon this process akin applying patterned paper plain white box multitexturing use more than one texture at time on polygon procedural textures created from adjusting parameters underlying algorithm that produces output texture bitmap textures created image editing application imported from digital camera are generally speaking common methods implementing texture definition on models computer graphics software while intended placement textures onto model's surface often requires technique known uv mapping arbitrary manual layout texture coordinates for polygon surfaces while nurbs surfaces have their own intrinsic parameterization used texture coordinates texture mapping discipline also encompasses techniques for creating normal maps bump maps that correspond texture simulate height specular maps help simulate shine light reflections well environment mapping simulate mirror-like reflectivity also called gloss anti-aliasing rendering resolution-independent entities such models for viewing on raster pixel-based device such liquid-crystal display crt television inevitably causes aliasing artifacts mostly along geometric edges boundaries texture details these artifacts are informally called jaggies anti-aliasing methods rectify such problems resulting imagery more pleasing viewer but can be somewhat computationally expensive various anti-aliasing algorithms such supersampling are able be employed then customized for most efficient rendering performance versus quality resultant imagery graphics artist should consider this trade-off if anti-aliasing methods are be used pre-anti-aliased bitmap texture being displayed on screen screen location at resolution different than resolution texture itself such textured model distance from virtual camera will exhibit aliasing artifacts while any procedurally defined texture will always show aliasing artifacts they are resolution-independent techniques such mipmapping texture filtering help solve texture-related aliasing problems volume rendering volume rendered ct scan forearm with different colour schemes for muscle fat bone blood volume rendering technique used display projection discretely sampled data set typical data set group slice images acquired by ct mri scanner usually these are acquired regular pattern eg one slice every millimeter usually have regular number image pixels regular pattern this example regular volumetric grid with each volume element voxel represented by single value that obtained by sampling immediate area surrounding voxel modeling main article modeling modeling process developing mathematical wireframe representation any three-dimensional object called model via specialized software models may be created automatically manually manual modeling process preparing geometric data for computer graphics similar plastic arts such sculpting models may be created using multiple approaches use nurbs curves generate accurate smooth surface patches polygonal mesh modeling manipulation faceted geometry polygonal mesh subdivision advanced tessellation polygons resulting smooth surfaces similar nurbs models model can be displayed two-dimensional image through process called rendering used computer simulation physical phenomena animated directly for other purposes model can also be
