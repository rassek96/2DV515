mainframe computer from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search for other uses see mainframe disambiguation ibm system z9 mainframe mainframe computers colloquially referred big iron are computers used primarily by large organizations for critical applications bulk data processing such census industry consumer statistics enterprise resource planning transaction processing term originally referred large cabinets called main frames that housed central processing unit main memory early computers later term was used distinguish high-end commercial machines from less powerful units most large-scale computer system architectures were established 1960s but continue evolve contents definition characteristics market history differences from supercomputers see also notes references external links definition modern mainframe design generally less defined by single-task computational speed typically defined mips rate flops case floating point calculations more by redundant internal engineering resulting high reliability security extensive input-output facilities with ability offload separate engines strict backward compatibility with older software high hardware computational utilization rates through virtualization support massive throughput their high stability reliability enables these machines run uninterrupted for decades software upgrades usually require setting up operating system portions thereof are non-disruptive only when using virtualizing facilities such ibm's z/os parallel sysplex unisys's xpcl which support workload sharing so that one system can take over another's application while being refreshed mainframes are defined by high availability one main reasons for their longevity since they are typically used applications where downtime would be costly catastrophic term reliability availability serviceability ras defining characteristic mainframe computers proper planning implementation required exploit these features if improperly implemented may serve inhibit benefits provided addition mainframes are more secure than other computer types nist vulnerabilities database us-cert rates traditional mainframes such ibm zseries unisys dorado unisys libra among most secure with vulnerabilities low single digits compared with thousands for windows unix linux late 1950s most mainframes had no explicitly interactive interface they accepted sets punched cards paper tape magnetic tape transfer data programs they operated batch mode support back office functions such customer billing supported interactive terminals almost exclusively for applications rather than program development typewriter teletype devices were also common control consoles for system operators through 1970s although ultimately supplanted by keyboard/display devices by early 1970s many mainframes acquired interactive user interfaces operated timesharing computers supporting hundreds users simultaneously along with batch processing users gained access through specialized terminals later from personal computers equipped with terminal emulation software by 1980s many mainframes supported graphical terminals terminal emulation but not graphical user interfaces this format end-user computing reached mainstream obsolescence 1990s due advent personal computers provided with guis after most modern mainframes have partially entirely phased out classic green screen terminal access for end-users favour web-style user interfaces infrastructure requirements were drastically reduced during mid-1990s when cmos mainframe designs replaced older bipolar technology ibm claimed that its newer mainframes could reduce data center energy costs for power cooling that they could reduce physical space requirements compared server farms characteristics inside ibm system z9 mainframe modern mainframes can run multiple different instances operating systems at same time this technique virtual machines allows applications run if they were on physically distinct computers this role single mainframe can replace higher-functioning hardware services available conventional servers while mainframes pioneered this capability virtualization now available on most families computer systems though not always same degree level sophistication mainframes can add hot swap system capacity without disrupting system function with specificity granularity level sophistication not usually available with most server solutions modern mainframes notably ibm zseries system z9 system z10 servers offer two levels virtualization logical partitions lpars via pr/sm facility virtual machines via z/vm operating system many mainframe customers run two machines one their primary data center one their backup data center—fully active partially active on standby—in case there catastrophe affecting first building test development training production workload for applications databases can run on single machine except for extremely large demands where capacity one machine might be limiting such two-mainframe installation can support continuous business service avoiding both planned unplanned outages practice many customers use multiple mainframes linked either by parallel sysplex shared dasd ibm's case with shared geographically dispersed storage provided by emc hitachi mainframes are designed handle very high volume input output i/o emphasize throughput computing since late-1950s mainframe designs have included subsidiary hardware called channels peripheral processors which manage i/o devices leaving cpu free deal only with high-speed memory common mainframe shops deal with massive databases files gigabyte terabyte-size record files are not unusual compared typical pc mainframes commonly have hundreds thousands times much data storage online can access reasonably fast other server families also offload i/o processing emphasize throughput computing mainframe return on investment roi like any other computing platform dependent on its ability scale support mixed workloads reduce labor costs deliver uninterrupted service for critical business applications several other risk-adjusted cost factors mainframes also have execution integrity characteristics for fault tolerant computing for example z900 z990 system z9 system z10 servers effectively execute result-oriented instructions twice compare results arbitrate between any differences through instruction retry failure isolation then shift workloads flight functioning processors including spares without any impact operating systems applications users this hardware-level feature also found hp's nonstop systems known lock-stepping because both processors take their steps ie instructions together not all applications absolutely need assured integrity that these systems provide but many do such financial transaction processing market ibm major manufacturer mainframe market unisys manufactures clearpath libra mainframes based on earlier burroughs products clearpath dorado mainframes based on sperry univac os product lines hitachi co-developed zseries z800 with ibm share expenses but subsequently two companies have not collaborated on

700/7000 series later development series mainframes latter architecture has continued evolve into their current zseries mainframes which along with then burroughs sperry now unisys mcp-based os1100 mainframes are among few mainframe architectures still extant that can trace their roots this early period while ibm's zseries can still run 24-bit system/360 code 64-bit zseries system z9 cmos servers have nothing physically common with older systems notable manufacturers outside us were siemens telefunken germany icl united kingdom olivetti italy fujitsu hitachi oki nec japan soviet union warsaw pact countries manufactured close copies ibm mainframes during cold war besm series strela are examples independently designed soviet computer shrinking demand tough competition started shakeout market early 1970s—rca sold out univac ge sold its business honeywell 1980s honeywell was bought out by bull univac became division sperry which later merged with burroughs form unisys corporation during 1980s minicomputer-based systems grew more sophisticated were able displace lower-end mainframes these computers sometimes called departmental computers were typified by dec vax at&t corporation briefly owned ncr during same period companies found that servers based on microcomputer designs could be deployed at fraction acquisition price offer local users much greater control over their own systems given policies practices at that time terminals used for interacting with mainframe systems were gradually replaced by personal computers consequently demand plummeted new mainframe installations were restricted mainly financial services government early 1990s there was rough consensus among industry analysts that mainframe was dying market mainframe platforms were increasingly replaced by personal computer networks infoworld's stewart alsop famously predicted that last mainframe would be unplugged he cited cheryl currid computer industry analyst saying that last mainframe will stop working on december reference anticipated year problem y2k that trend started turn around late 1990s corporations found new uses for their existing mainframes price data networking collapsed most parts world encouraging trends toward more centralized computing growth e-business also dramatically increased number back-end transactions processed by mainframe software well size throughput databases batch processing such billing became even more important larger with growth e-business mainframes are particularly adept at large scale batch computing another factor currently increasing mainframe use development linux operating system which arrived on ibm mainframe systems typically run scores hundreds virtual machines on single mainframe linux allows users take advantage open source software combined with mainframe hardware ras rapid expansion development emerging markets particularly people's republic china also spurring major mainframe investments solve exceptionally difficult computing problems eg providing unified extremely high volume online transaction processing databases for billion consumers across multiple industries banking insurance credit reporting government services etc late ibm introduced 64-bit z/architecture acquired numerous software companies such cognos introduced those software products mainframe ibm's quarterly annual reports 2000s usually reported increasing mainframe revenues capacity shipments however ibm's mainframe hardware business has not been immune recent overall downturn server hardware market model cycle effects for example 4th quarter ibm's system z hardware revenues decreased by 27% year over year but mips shipments increased 4% per year over past two years alsop had himself photographed symbolically eating his own words death mainframe nasa powered down its last mainframe ibm system z9 however ibm's successor z9 z10 led new york times reporter state four years earlier that mainframe technology — hardware software services — remains large lucrative business for ibm mainframes are still back-office engines behind world’s financial markets much global commerce while mainframe technology represented less than 3% ibm's revenues continue play outsized role big blue's results ibm launched its most recent generation mainframe ibm z13 differences from supercomputers supercomputer computer that at frontline current processing capacity particularly speed calculation supercomputers are used for scientific engineering problems high-performance computing which are data crunching number crunching while mainframes are used for transaction processing differences are follows mainframes are built be reliable for transaction processing measured by tpc-metrics not used very helpful for most supercomputing applications commonly understood business world commercial exchange goods services money typical transaction defined by transaction processing performance council would include updating database system for such things inventory control goods airline reservations services banking money transaction could refer set operations including disk read/writes operating system calls some form data transfer from one subsystem another this operation doesn't count toward processing power computer transaction processing not exclusive mainframes but also used performance microprocessor-based servers online networks supercomputers are measured floating point operations per second flops traversed edges per second teps metrics that are not very meaningful for mainframe applications while mainframes are sometimes approximately measured millions instructions per second mips metric not used on supercomputers not very helpful it's arguably neither for mainframes measure real performance transaction processing goal but such similar sub-component may be used for billing purposes examples integer operations instructions counted by mips include adding numbers together checking values moving data around memory while moving information from storage so-called i/o most helpful for mainframes within memory only helping indirectly floating point operations are mostly addition subtraction multiplication binary floating point supercomputers measured by flops with enough digits precision model continuous phenomena such weather prediction nuclear simulations only recently standardized decimal floating point not used supercomputers are appropriate from monetary values such those useful for mainframe applications terms computational ability supercomputers are more powerful amalgamation different technologies architectures for supercomputers mainframes has led so-called gameframe see also computer types failover gameframe channel i/o cloud computing notes
