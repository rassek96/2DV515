typical features typical pda has touchscreen for entering data memory card slot for data storage irda bluetooth and/or wi-fi however some pdas may not have touchscreen using softkeys directional pad numeric keypad thumb keyboard for input this typically seen on telephones that are also pdasto have functions expected pda device's software typically includes appointment calendar to-do list address book for contacts calculator some sort memo note program pdas with wireless data connections also typically include email client web browser touchscreen many original pdas such apple newton palm pilot featured touchscreen for user interaction having only few buttons—usually reserved for shortcuts often-used programs some touchscreen pdas including windows mobile devices had detachable stylus facilitate making selections user interacts with device by tapping screen select buttons issue commands by dragging finger stylus on screen make selections scroll typical methods entering text on touchscreen pdas include virtual keyboard where keyboard shown on touchscreen text entered by tapping on-screen keyboard with finger stylus external keyboard connected via usb infrared port bluetooth some users may choose chorded keyboard for one-handed use handwriting recognition where letters words are written on touchscreen often with stylus pda converts input text recognition computation handwritten horizontal vertical formulas such + = may also be feature stroke recognition allows user make predefined set strokes on touchscreen sometimes special input area representing various characters be input strokes are often simplified character shapes making them easier for device recognize one widely known stroke recognition system palm's graffiti despite research development projects end-users experience mixed results with handwriting recognition systems some find frustrating inaccurate while others are satisfied with quality recognition touchscreen pdas intended for business use such blackberry palm treo usually also offer full keyboards scroll wheels thumbwheels facilitate data entry navigation many touchscreen pdas support some form external keyboard well specialized folding keyboards which offer full-sized keyboard but collapse into compact size for transport are available for many models external keyboards may attach pda directly using cable may use wireless technology such infrared bluetooth connect pda newer pdas such htc hd2 apple iphone apple ipod touch palm pre palm pre plus palm pixi palm pixi plus google android operating system include more advanced forms touchscreen that can register multiple touches simultaneously these multi-touch displays allow for more sophisticated interfaces using various gestures entered with one more fingers memory cards although many early pdas did not have memory card slots now most have either some form secure digital sd slot compactflash slot combination two although designed for memory secure digital input/output sdio compactflash cards are available that provide accessories like wi-fi digital cameras if device can support them some pdas also have usb port mainly for usb flash drives some pdas use microsd cards which are electronically compatible with sd cards but have much smaller physical size wired connectivity while early pdas connected user's personal computer via serial ports another proprietary connection many today connect via usb cable older pdas were unable connect each other via usb their implementations usb didn't support acting host some early pdas were able connect internet indirectly by means external modem connected via pda's serial port sync connector directly by using expansion card that provided ethernet port wireless connectivity most modern pdas have bluetooth popular wireless protocol for mobile devices bluetooth can be used connect keyboards headsets gps receivers other nearby accessories it's also possible transfer files between pdas that have bluetooth many modern pdas have wi-fi wireless network connectivity can connect wi-fi hotspots all smartphones some other modern pdas can connect wireless wide area networks such those provided by cellular telecommunications companies older pdas from 1990s typically had irda infrared port allowing short-range line-of-sight wireless communication few current models use this technology has been supplanted by bluetooth wi-fi irda allows communication between two pdas between pda any device with irda port adapter some printers have irda receivers allowing irda-equipped pdas print them if pda's operating system supports universal pda keyboards designed for these older pdas use infrared technology infrared technology low-cost has advantage being allowed aboard synchronization most pdas can synchronize their data with applications on user's computer this allows user update contact schedule other information on their computer using software such microsoft outlook act have that same data transferred pda—or transfer updated information from pda back computer this eliminates need for user update their data two places synchronization also prevents loss information stored on device if lost stolen destroyed when pda repaired replaced can be re-synced with computer restoring user's data some users find that data input quicker on their computer than on their pda since text input via touchscreen small-scale keyboard slower than full-size keyboard transferring data pda via computer therefore lot quicker than having manually input all data on handheld device most pdas come with ability synchronize computer this done through synchronization software provided with handheld sometime with computer's operating system examples synchronization software include hotsync manager for palm os pdas 'microsoft activesync used by windows xp older windows operating systems synchronize with windows mobile pocket pc windows ce pdas well pdas running ios palm os symbian microsoft windows mobile device center for windows vista which supports microsoft windows mobile pocket pc devices apple itunes used on mac os x microsoft windows sync ios devices such iphone ipod touch isync included with mac os x can synchronize many syncml-enabled pdas blackberry desktop software used sync blackberry devices these programs allow pda be synchronized with personal information manager which may be part computer's operating system provided with pda sold separately by third party for example rim blackberry comes with rim's desktop manager program which can synchronize both microsoft outlook act other pdas come only with their own proprietary software for example some early palm os pdas came only with palm desktop while later palm pdas—such treo 650—have ability sync palm desktop microsoft outlook microsoft's activesync windows mobile device center only synchronize with microsoft outlook microsoft exchange server third-party synchronization software also available for some pdas from companies like commontime companionlink third-party software can be used synchronize pdas other personal information managers that are not supported by pda manufacturers for example goldmine ibm lotus notes wireless synchronization some pdas can synchronize some all their data using their wireless networking capabilities rather than having be directly connected personal computer via cable apple ios devices like iphone ipod touch ipad can use apple's icloud service formerly mobileme synchronize calendar address book mail account internet bookmark other data with one more macintosh windows computers using wi-fi cellular data connections devices running palm's webos google's android operating system primarily sync with cloud for example if gmail used information contacts email calendar
