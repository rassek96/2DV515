from both parties leads draw hence tic-tac-toe most often played by young children because simplicity tic-tac-toe often used pedagogical tool for teaching concepts good sportsmanship branch artificial

early variation tic-tac-toe was played roman empire around first century bc was called terni lapilli instead having any number pieces each player only had three thus they had move them around empty spaces keep playing game's grid markings have been found chalked all over rome however according claudia zaslavsky's book tic tac toe other three-in-a row games from ancient egypt modern computer tic-tac-toe could be traced back ancient egypt another closely related ancient game three men's morris which also played on simple grid requires three pieces row finish different names game are more recent first print reference noughts crosses british name appeared his novel can you forgive her anthony trollope refers clerk playing tit-tat-toe first print reference game called tick-tack-toe occurred but referred children's game played on slate consisting trying with eyes shut bring pencil down on one numbers set number hit being scored tic-tac-toe may also derive from tick-tack name old

university cambridge became one first known video games computer player could play perfect games tic-tac-toe against human opponent tic-tac-toe was also used by mit students demonstrate computational power tinkertoy elements tinkertoy computer made out almost only tinkertoys able play tic-tac-toe perfectly currently on display at museum science boston combinatorics first two plies game tree for tic-tac-toe once rotations reflections are eliminated there are only three opening moves – corner side middle despite its apparent simplicity tic-tac-toe requires detailed analysis determine even some elementary combinatory facts most interesting which are number possible games number possible positions position merely state board while game usually refers way terminal position obtained naive counting leads possible board layouts since each nine spaces can be x o blank ie possible games different sequences for placing xs os on board however two matters much reduce these numbers game ends when three-in-a-row obtained if x starts number xs always either equal exactly more than number os complete analysis further complicated by definitions used when setting conditions like board symmetries number terminal positions when considering only state board after taking into account board symmetries ie rotations reflections there are only terminal board positions assuming that x makes first move every time distinct positions are won by x distinct positions are won by o distinct positions are drawn strategy optimal strategy for player x each grid shaded red x denotes optimal move location o's next move gives next subgrid examine note that only two sequences moves by o both starting with center top-right left-mid lead draw with remaining sequences leading wins from x optimal strategy for player o player o can always force win draw by taking center if taken by x then o must take corner player can play perfect game tic-tac-toe win at least draw if they choose first available move from following list each turn used newell simon's tic-tac-toe program win if player has two row they can place third get three row block if opponent has two row player must play third themselves block opponent fork create opportunity where player has two threats win two non-blocked lines blocking opponent's fork o option player should create two row force opponent into defending long doesn't result them creating fork for example if x has corner o has center x has opposite corner well o must not play corner order win playing corner this scenario creates fork for x win o option if there configuration where opponent can fork player should block that fork center player marks center if first move game playing on corner gives o more opportunities make mistake may therefore be better choice however makes no difference between perfect players opposite corner if opponent corner player plays opposite corner empty corner player plays corner square empty side player plays middle square on any sides first player who shall be designated x has possible positions mark during first turn superficially might seem that there are possible positions corresponding squares grid however by rotating board we will find that first turn every corner mark strategically equivalent every other corner mark same true every edge side middle mark for strategy purposes there are therefore only three possible first marks corner edge center player x can win force draw from any these starting marks however playing corner gives opponent smallest choice squares which must be played avoid losing this makes corner best opening move for x when opponent not perfect player second player who shall be designated o must respond x's opening mark such way avoid forced win player o must always respond corner opening with center mark center opening with corner mark edge opening must be answered either with center mark corner mark next x edge mark opposite x any other responses will allow x force win once opening completed o's task follow above list priorities order force draw else gain win if x makes weak play more detailedly guarantee draw o should adopt following strategies if x plays corner opening move best move for them o should take center then edge forcing x block next move this will stop any forks from happening when both x o are perfect players x chooses start by marking corner o takes center x takes corner opposite original that case o free choose any edge its second move however if x not perfect player has played corner then edge o should not play opposite edge its second move because then x not forced block next move can fork if x plays edge opening move o should take center then follow above list priorities mainly paying attention block forks if x plays center opening move o should take corner then follow above list priorities mainly paying attention block forks when x plays corner first best move for them o not perfect player following may happen if o responds with center mark best move for them perfect x player will take corner opposite original then o should play edge however if o plays corner its second move perfect x player will mark remaining corner blocking o's 3-in-a-row making their own fork if o responds with corner mark x guaranteed win by simply taking any other two corners then last fork since when x takes third corner o can only take position between two x's then x can take only remaining corner win if o responds with edge mark x guaranteed win by taking center then o can only take corner opposite corner which x plays first then x can take corner win further details let's label nine positions on board follows when x plays opening move then o should take then x takes this situation o should not take o should take x1 → o5 → x9 → o2 → x8 → o7 → x3 → o6 → x4 this game will be draw this situation o should not take o should take fact taking best move since non-perfect player x may take then o can take win x1 → o5 → x6 → o2 → x8 then o should not take x can take win o should not take x can take win o should take o x1 → o5 → x6 → o2 → x8 → o7 → x3 → o9 → x4 this game will be draw o x1 → o5 → x6 → o2 → x8 → o9 → x4 → o7 →

{1}{3}}} property win if x not perfect player x may take second move then this game will be draw x cannot win x1 → o5 → x2 → o3 → x7 → o4 → x6 → o8 → x9 this game will be draw x1 → o5 → x3 → o2 → x8 → o4 → x6 → o9 → x7 this game will be draw if x plays opening move o not perfect player following may happen although o takes only good position first move but o takes bad position second move x1 → o5 → x9 → o3 → x7 then x can take win x1 → o5 → x6 → o4 → x3 then x can take win x1 → o5 → x6 → o7 → x3 then x can take win although o takes good positions first two moves but o takes bad position third move x1 → o5 → x6 → o2 → x8 → o3 → x7 then x can take win x1 → o5 → x6 → o2 → x8 → o4 → x9 then x can take win o takes bad position first move except all other positions are bad x1 → o3 → x7 → o4 → x9
