racing simulators driving simulators they are usually packaged with large paddle styled steering wheel along with set pedals for gas brake sometimes clutch actuation well various shifter controls analog wheel pedal set such this allows user accurately manipulate steering angle pedal control that required properly manage simulated car opposed digital control such keyboard relatively large range motion further allows user more accurately apply controls racing wheels have been developed for use with arcade games game consoles personal computers also for professional driving simulators for race drivers force feedback racing wheels started off simple plastic wheels hooked up rotary potentiometer which were sprung by springs bungees eventually manufacturers began use electric motors controllers place springs order achieve level force feedback first seen microsoft's sidewinder wheel at first this technology simply provided centering force other artificial effects such shaking wheel crash other vibrations however driving simulations have evolved their physics engines have become more accurate developers have linked their in-game physics more closely force feedback this allows user truly feel what forces go through steering rack instead just artificial effects genuinely enhance realism game despite this some high end manufacturers believe that force feedback has still not been perfected therefore companies such thomas superwheel have not adopted force feedback system their products frex on other hand has gone other way equips their high-end simwheel with powerful force feedback no mechanical centering device comparison racing wheels manufacturer product max rotation deg ffb clutch shifter brake sensor pedal type atomic lamborghini gallardo evo racing
