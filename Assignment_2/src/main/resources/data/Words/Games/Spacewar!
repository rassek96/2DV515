spacewar from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search spacewar spacewar on pdp-1 developers steve russell publishers steve russell platforms pdp-1 release dates na genres space combat modes multiplayer spacewar space combat video game developed by steve russell collaboration with martin graetz wayne wiitanen programmed by russell with assistance from others including bob saunders steve piner was written for newly installed dec pdp-1 at massachusetts institute technology after its initial creation spacewar was expanded further by other students employees universities area including dan edwards peter samson was also spread many few dozen primarily academic installations pdp-1 computer making spacewar first known video game be played at multiple computer installations game features two spaceships needle wedge engaged dogfight while maneuvering gravity well star both ships are controlled by human players each ship has limited fuel for maneuvering limited number torpedoes ships follow newtonian physics remaining motion even when player not accelerating flying near star provide gravity assist was common tactic ships are destroyed when hit with torpedo colliding with star at any time player can engage hyperspace feature move new random location on screen though each use has increasing chance destroying ship instead game was initially controlled with switches on pdp-1 though alan kotok bob saunders built early gamepad reduce difficulty awkwardness controlling game spacewar one most important influential games early history video games was extremely popular small programming community 1960s was widely ported other computer systems at time has also been recreated more modern programming languages for pdp-1 emulators directly inspired many other electronic games such first commercial arcade games galaxy game computer space later games such asteroids spacewar was named list ten most important video games all time which formed start game canon at library congress contents background gameplay development legacy notes references external links background steve russell designer main programmer initial version spacewar during 1950s various computer games were created context academic computer programming research for demonstrations computing power especially after introduction later decade smaller faster computers on which programs could be created run real time opposed being executed batches few programs however while used showcase power computer they ran on were also intended entertainment products these were generally created by undergraduate graduate students university employees such at massachusetts institute technology mit where they were allowed on occasion develop programs for tx-0 experimental computer these interactive graphical games were created by community programmers many them students university employees affiliated with tech model railroad club tmrc led by alan kotok peter samson bob saunders games included tic-tac-toe which used light pen play simple game noughts crosses against computer mouse maze which used light pen set up maze walls for virtual mouse traverse fall digital equipment corporation dec pdp-1 minicomputer was installed kludge room mit electrical engineering department complement older tx-0 even before its arrival group students university employees had been brainstorming ideas for programs that would demonstrate new computer's capabilities compelling way three them—steve russell then employee at harvard university former research assistant at mit martin graetz research assistant former student at mit wayne wiitanen research assistant at harvard former employee student at mit—referring their collaboration hingham institute graetz wiitanen were living tenement building on hingham street cambridge massachusetts came up with idea for spacewar we had this brand new pdp-1 steve russell told rolling stone interview somebody had built some little pattern-generating programs which made interesting patterns like kaleidoscope not very good demonstration here was this display that could do all sorts good things so we started talking about figuring what would be interesting displays we decided that probably you could make two-dimensional maneuvering sort thing decided that naturally obvious thing do was spaceships gameplay recreation spacewar java gameplay spacewar involves two monochrome spaceships called needle wedge each controlled by player attempting shoot one another while maneuvering on two-dimensional plane gravity well star set against backdrop starfield ships fire torpedoes which are not affected by gravitational pull star ships have limited number torpedoes limited supply fuel which used when player fires his thrusters torpedoes are fired one at time by flipping toggle switch on computer pressing button on control pad there cooldown period between launches ships follow newtonian physics remaining motion even when player not accelerating though ships can rotate at constant rate without inertia each player controls one ships must attempt shoot down other ship while avoiding collision with star flying near star can provide gravity assist player at risk misjudging trajectory falling into star if ship moves past one edge screen reappears on other side wraparound effect hyperspace feature panic button can be used last-ditch means evade enemy torpedoes by moving player's ship another location on screen after disappearing for few seconds but reentry from hyperspace occurs at random location some versions there increasing probability ship exploding with each use player controls include clockwise counterclockwise rotation forward thrust firing torpedoes hyperspace initially these were controlled using front-panel test switches on pdp-1 minicomputer with four switches for each player but these proved be awkward use wore out quickly under normal gameplay well causing players accidentally flip computer's control power switches location switches also left one player off one side crt display due limited space front computer which left them at disadvantage alleviate these problems kotok saunders created detached control device essentially early gamepad gamepad had switch for turning left right another for forward thrust hyperspace torpedo launch button button was silent so that opposing player would not have warning that player was attempting fire torpedo during cooldown period development vint cerf playing spacewar on computer history museum's pdp-1 at icann meeting fall while brainstorming ideas for program for pdp-1 russell had just finished reading lensman series by e e doc smith thought stories would make good basis for program his heroes had strong tendency get pursued by villain across galaxy have invent their way out their problem while they were being pursued that sort action was thing that suggested spacewar he had some very glowing descriptions spaceship encounters space fleet maneuvers other influences cited by fellow programmer martin graetz include ee smith's skylark novels japanese pulp fiction tokusatsu movies for first few months after its installation pdp-1 programming community at mit focused on simpler programs work out how create software for computer community had heard spacewar concept however understood that russell would spearhead development when members community began feel time was right start work on game russell nicknamed slug because his tendency procrastinate began providing various excuses why he could not start programming game one these was lack trigonometric function routine needed calculate trajectories spacecraft this prompted alan kotok tmrc call dec who informed him that they had such routine already written kotok drove dec pick up tape containing code slammed down front russell asked what other excuses he had russell later explaining that i looked around i didn't find excuse so i had settle down do some figuring started writing code december game was developed meet three precepts russell graetz wiitanen had developed for creating program that functioned equally well entertainment experience for players demonstration for spectators use much computer's resources possible be consistently interesting therefore have every run be different be entertaining therefore game took russell with assistance from other programmers—including bob saunders steve piner but not including wiitanen who had been called up by united states army reserve—about man-hours write first version spacewar around six weeks develop basic game excerpt from expensive planetarium star charts russell had program with movable dot by january early operational game with rotatable spaceships by february two spaceships were designed evoke curvy spaceship from buck rogers stories pgm-11 redstone rocket that early version also contained randomly generated background starfield initially added by russell because blank background made difficult tell relative motion two spaceships at slow speeds programming community area including hingham institute tmrc had developed what was later termed hacker ethic whereby all programs were freely shared modified by other programmers collaborative environment without concern for ownership copyright which led group effort elaborate on russell's initial spacewar game consequently since inaccuracy lack realism starfield annoyed tmrc member peter samson he wrote program based on real star charts that scrolled slowly through night sky including every star band between 225° n 225° s down fifth magnitude displayed at their relative brightness program was called expensive planetarium—referring high price pdp-1 computer compared analog planetarium part series expensive programs like expensive typewriter—and was quickly incorporated into game march by russell who served collator primary version game spacewar on computer history museum's pdp-1 initial version game also did not include central star gravity well hyperspace feature they were written by mit graduate student tmrc member dan edwards graetz respectively add elements strategy what initially was shooter game pure reflexes initial version hyperspace function was limited three jumps but carried no risk save possibly re-entering game dangerous position later versions removed limit but added increasing risk destroying ship instead moving additionally during this development period kotok saunders created gamepads for game game was multiplayer-only game because computer had no resources left over handle controlling other ship similarly other proposed additions game such more refined explosion display upon destruction spaceship having torpedoes also be affected by gravity had be abandoned there were not enough computer resources handle them while smoothly running game with added features changes spacewar was essentially complete by late april russell other programmers shifted focus from developing game preparing show off others such at mit science open house may group added time limit well larger second screen for viewers at demonstration that same month graetz presented paper about game spacewar real-time capability pdp-1 at first meeting digital equipment computer users' society demonstration was success game proved very popular at mit laboratory that hosted pdp-1 soon banned play except during lunch after working hours beginning summer continuing over next few years members pdp-1 programming community at mit including russell other hingham institute members began spread out other schools employers such stanford university dec they did they spread game other universities institutions with pdp-1 computer result spacewar was perhaps first video game be available outside single research institute over next decade programmers at these other institutions began coding their own variants including features such allowing more ships players at once replacing hyperspace feature with cloaking device space mines even first-person perspective version played on two screens that simulates each pilot's view out cockpit some these spacewar installations also replicated kotok saunders' gamepad according second-hand account heard by russell while working at dec spacewar was reportedly used smoke test by dec technicians on new pdp-1 systems before shipping because was only available program that exercised every aspect hardware although game was widespread for era was still very limited its direct reach pdp-1 was priced at us$120000 only were ever sold most without monitor many remainder secure military locations research labs with no free computer time which prevented original spacewar from reaching beyond narrow academic audience legacy two users playing spacewar on pdp-12 at vintage computer festival spacewar was extremely popular small programming community 1960s was widely recreated on other minicomputer mainframe computers time before migrating early microcomputer systems 1970s early computer scientist alan kay noted that game spacewar blossoms spontaneously wherever there graphics display connected computer graetz recalled that game initially spread could be found on just about any research computer that had programmable crt majority this spread took place several years after initial development game while there are early anecdotes players game variants at handful locations primarily near mit stanford was only after that computers hooked up monitors terminals capable playing spacewar began proliferate allowing game reach wider audience influence later video game designers—by estimated that there were over computers with monitors rather than few dozen around this time that majority game variants were created for various computer systems such later pdp systems game was well-known enough programming community that rolling stone sponsored spacewar olympics possibly first video game tournament early 1970s spacewar migrated from large computer systems commercial setting formed basis for first two coin-operated video games while playing spacewar at stanford sometime between college student hugh tuck remarked that coin-operated version game would be very successful while high price minicomputer prevented such game from being feasible then tuck bill pitts created prototype coin-operated computer game galaxy game with us$20000 pdp-11 around same time second prototype coin-operated game based on spacewar computer space was developed by nolan bushnell ted dabney which would become first commercially sold arcade video game first widely available video game any kind though tuck felt that computer space was poor imitation spacewar his game superior adaptation many players believed both games be upgraded variants spacewar byte magazine published assembly language version spacewar that ran on altair other intel 8080-based microcomputers using oscilloscope graphical display lookup table for orbits well three-dimensional variant written tiny basic more modern recreations game for computers have been made well emulated version original game based on original source code made publicly available by martin graetz running javascript pdp-1 emulator was made available play on internet only working pdp-1s that are known exist are kept computer history museum mountain view california where demonstrations machine are held which include playing spacewar addition galaxy game computer space numerous other games have been directly inspired by spacewar these include orbitwar plato network computers space wars arcade space war atari additionally asteroids designer ed logg used elements from spacewar namely hyperspace button shape player's ship products late computer game star control drew direct inspiration from spacewar russell has been quoted saying that aspect game that he was most pleased with was number other programmers inspired write
