defined pieces music that share certain style basic musical language others such allan f moore state that genre style are two separate terms that secondary characteristics such subject matter can also differentiate between genres music genre subgenre may be defined by musical techniques styles context content spirit themes geographical origin sometimes used identify music genre though single geographical category will often include wide variety subgenres several music scholars have criticised priority accorded genre-based communities listening practices for example laurie argues that

charaudeau maingueneau 2002278–280 rhetoric field rhetoric genre theorists usually understand genres types actions rather than types forms texts on this perspective texts are channels through which genres are enacted carolyn miller's work has been especially important for this perspective drawing on lloyd bitzer's concept rhetorical situation miller reasons that recurring rhetorical problems tend elicit recurring responses drawing on alfred schütz she reasons that these recurring responses become typified – that socially constructed recognizable types miller argues that these typified rhetorical actions p are properly understood genres building off miller charles bazerman clay spinuzzi have argued that genres understood actions derive their meaning from other genres – that other actions bazerman therefore proposes that we analyze genres terms genre systems while spinuzzi prefers closely related concept genre ecologies this tradition has had implications for teaching writing american colleges universities combining rhetorical genre theory with activity theory david russell has proposed that standard english composition courses are ill suited teach genres that students will write other contexts across university beyond elizabeth wardle contends that standard composition courses do teach genres but that these are inauthentic mutt genres that are often little use outside composition courses history this concept genre originated from classification systems created by plato plato divided literature into three classic genres accepted ancient greece poetry drama prose poetry further subdivided into epic lyric drama divisions are recognized being set by aristotle plato however they were not only ones many genre theorists added these accepted forms poetry classical romance genre theory earliest recorded systems genre western history can be traced back plato aristotle gérard genette explains his interpretation history genre architext he described plato creator three imitational mimetic genres distinguished by mode imitation rather than content these three imitational genres include dramatic dialogue drama pure narrative dithyramb mixture two epic plato excluded lyric poetry non-mimetic imitational mode genette further discussed how aristotle revised plato's system by first eliminating pure narrative viable mode he then uses two additional criteria distinguish system first criteria object be imitated whether superior inferior second criterion medium presentation words gestures verse essentially three categories mode object medium can be visualized along xyz axis excluding criteria medium aristotle's system distinguished four types classical genres tragedy epic comedy parody genette explained integration lyric poetry into classical system by replacing removed pure narrative mode lyric poetry once considered non-mimetic was deemed imitate feelings becoming third architext term coined by gennette new long-enduring tripartite system lyrical epical mixed narrative dramatic dialogue this new system that came dominate all literary theory german romanticism genette has seen numerous attempts at expansion revision such attempts include friedrich schlegel's triad subjective form lyric objective form dramatic subjective-objective form epic however more ambitious efforts expand tripartite system resulted new taxonomic systems

adds that relationship with genre situation reciprocal individuals may find themselves shaping rhetorical situations which turn affect rhetorical responses that arise out situation because social
