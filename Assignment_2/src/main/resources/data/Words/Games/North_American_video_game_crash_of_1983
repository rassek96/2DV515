clone for radio shack each these consoles had its own library games produced by console maker many had large libraries games produced by third-party developers analysts noticed trends saturation mentioning that amount new software coming will only allow few big hits that retailers had too much floor space for systems along with price drops for home computers could result industry shakeup competition from home computers see also history personal computers commodore weathered crash went on become one best selling computers all time first microcomputers such altair apple i were marketed niche electronics hobbyists most required assembly from kit pre-assembled machines with basic rom became available including trio '77 apple ii commodore pet trs-80 model i latter two retailed for under $1000 but lacked game joysticks high-resolution color video third-party developers created games for all these platforms trs-80 benefited from radio shack's retail stores which displayed

compendium reviews atari 8-bit software used pages for games compared for all other software types because computers generally had more memory faster processors than console they permitted more sophisticated games they could also be used for tasks such word processing home accounting games were easier duplicate since they could be packaged floppy disks cassette tapes instead rom modules though some cassette-based systems retained rom modules instant-on option this opened field cottage industry third-party software developers writeable storage media allowed players save games progress useful feature for increasingly complex games which was not available on consoles era price war began between commodore texas instruments home computers became inexpensive video-game consoles after commodore cut retail price $300 june some stores began selling for little $199 dan gutman founder video games player magazine recalled that first wave personal computer boom started video games market began taper off people asked themselves 'why should i buy video game system when i can buy computer that will play games do so much more' newspaper stated september about cancellation intellivision iii who was going pay $200-plus for machine that could only play games commodore explicitly targeted video game players by offering competitive upgrades where rival systems could be traded for discount toward purchase commodore commodore's ownership chip fabricator mos technology allowed manufacture integrated circuits in-house so vic-20 c64 sold for much lower prices than competing home computers by gutman wrote video games were officially dead computers were hot he renamed his magazine computer games october but i noticed that word games became dirty word press we started replacing with simulations often possible soon computer slump began suddenly everyone was saying that home computer was fad just another hula hoop computer games published its last issue late computer gaming world founder russell sipe noted that arcade game crash took down majority computer game magazines with he stated that by winter only few computer game magazines remained by summer computer gaming world was only 4-color computer game magazine left inflation american game industry lobbied washington dc for smaller $1 coin closer size quarter arguing that inflation which had reduced quarter's spending power by third early 1980s was making difficult prosper during 1970s dollar coin use was eisenhower dollar large coin impractical for coin vending machines susan b anthony dollar was introduced its size fit video game manufacturers' demands but was failure with general public ironically new coin's similarity quarter was one most common complaints canada existing dollar bills were removed from circulation replaced with coins arcade machines japan had standardized use ¥100 coins worth roughly $1 which industry veteran mark cerny proposed reason for japan's game industry stability time loss publishing control activision became first third-party developer was founded by atari programmers who left company because atari did not allow credits appear on games did not pay employees royalty based on sales at time atari was owned by warner communications developers felt that they should receive same recognition that musicians directors actors got from warner's other divisions after activision went into business atari quickly sued block sales activision's products but never won restraining order ultimately settled case this court case legitimized third-party development encouraging companies such quaker oats with their us games division rush open video-game divisions hoping impress both stockholders consumers david crane one founders activision following his departure from atari noted that within six-month period between two consecutive consumer electronic shows at that time number third-party developers jumped from attempting capitalize on success activision companies lured away each other's programmers used reverse engineering learn how make games for proprietary systems atari even hired several programmers from mattel's intellivision development studio prompting lawsuit by mattel against atari that included charges industrial espionage despite lessons learned by atari loss its programmers activision mattel continued try avoid crediting game designers rather than reveal names intellivision game designers mattel instead required that tv guide interview with them change their names protect their collective identities colecovision designers worked similar obscurity feeding more departures upstart competitors second half number cartridges grew from june more than december experts predicted glut with 10% games producing 75% sales byte stated december that few games broke new ground either design format if public really likes idea milked for all it's worth numerous clones different color soon crowd shelves that until public stops buying something better comes along companies who believe that microcomputer games are hula hoop 1980s only want play quick profit unlike nintendo sega sony microsoft later decades hardware manufacturers this era lost exclusive control their platforms' supply games with they also lost ability ensure stores were never overloaded with products activision atari mattel all had experienced programmers but many new companies rushing join market did not have enough experience talent create games titles such chase chuck wagon about dogs eating food funded by dog food company purina skeet shoot lost luggage were examples games made hopes taking advantage video-game boom while heavily advertised marketed these games were perceived be poor quality did not catch on hoped further damaging industry addition recoup revenue companies like coleco atari would publish their own games on each others' systems this greatly increased saturation spurred companies like sears cbs publish same games on their own cartridges sometimes with different names fallout effects immediate effects release so many new games flooded market most stores had insufficient space carry new games consoles stores tried return surplus games new publishers publishers had neither new products nor cash issue refunds retailers many publishers including games by apollo us games quickly folded unable return unsold games defunct publishers stores marked down titles placed them discount bins sale tables recently released games which initially sold for usd$35 were bins for $5 by june market for more expensive games had shrunk dramatically was replaced by new market rushed-to-market low-budget games massive industry shakeout resulted magnavox abandoned video game business entirely imagic withdrew its ipo day before its stock was go public company later collapsed result while some stores sold new games machines most retailers stopped selling video game consoles reduced their stock significantly reserving floor shelf space for other products this was most formidable barrier that confronted nintendo tried market its famicom system united states retailer opposition video games was directly responsible for causing nintendo brand its product entertainment system rather than console using terms such control deck game pak well producing toy robot called rob convince toy retailers allow their stores sales home video games had dropped considerably during this period from $3 billion low $100 million despite atari's claim million sales its game system during that year recovery was slow following release nintendo entertainment system atari sega master system industry began recovering with annual sales exceeding $23 billion by with 70% market dominated by nintendo nintendo president hiroshi yamauchi noted that atari collapsed because they gave too much freedom third-party developers market was swamped with rubbish games response nintendo limited number titles that third-party developers could release for their system each year promoted its seal quality which allowed be used on games peripherals by publishers that met nintendo's quality standards end crash

market resurgent atari by home video game sales united states had reached $5 billion surpassing peak $3 billion during previous generation large majority market was controlled by nintendo sold more than million units united states exceeding sales other consoles personal computers by considerable margin other japanese companies also rivaled nintendo's success united states with sega's mega drive/genesis nec's pc engine/turbografx released same year second highly visible result crash was institution measures control third-party development software using secrecy combat industrial espionage had failed stop rival companies from reverse engineering mattel atari systems hiring away their trained game programmers while mattel coleco implemented lockout measures control third-party development colecovision bios checked for copyright string on power-up atari was completely unprotected once information on its hardware became available little prevented anyone from making games for nintendo thus instituted strict licensing policy for nes that included equipping cartridge console with lockout chips which were region-specific had match order for game work addition preventing use unlicensed games also was designed combat piracy rarely problem united states europe but rampant east asia accolade achieved technical victory one court case against sega challenging this control even though ultimately yielded signed sega licensing agreement several publishers notably tengen atari color dreams camerica challenged nintendo's control system during 8-bit era by producing unlicensed nes games concepts such control system remain use on every major video game console produced today even with fewer cartridge-based consoles on market than 8/16-bit era replacing security chips most modern consoles are specially encoded optical discs that cannot be copied by most users can only be read by particular console under normal circumstances released sega genesis was first real contender nintendo's market dominance nintendo reserved large part nes game revenue for itself by limiting most third-party publishers only five games per year on its systems some companies tried get around this by creating additional company labels like konami's ultra games label also required all cartridges be manufactured by nintendo be paid for full before they were manufactured cartridges could not be returned nintendo so publishers assumed all risk result some publishers lost more money due distress sales remaining inventory at end nes era than they ever earned profits from sales games nintendo portrayed these measures intended protect public against poor-quality games placed golden seal approval on all licensed games released for system these strict licensing measures backfired somewhat after nintendo was accused trust behavior longer run however many third-party publishers such electronic arts actively supported competing consoles such sega genesis most nintendo platform-control
