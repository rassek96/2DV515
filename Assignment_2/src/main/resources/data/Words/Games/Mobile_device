enough hold operate hand having operating system capable running mobile apps these may provide diverse range functions typically device will have display screen with small numeric alphanumeric keyboard touchscreen providing virtual keyboard buttons icons on-screen many such devices can connect internet interconnect with other devices such car entertainment systems headsets via wi-fi bluetooth near field communication nfc integrated cameras digital media players mobile phone gps capabilities are common power typically provided by lithium battery early pocket-sized devices were joined late 2000s by larger but otherwise similar tablet computers input output now usually via touch-screen interface smartphones personal digital assistants may provide much functionality laptop desktop computer but more conveniently enterprise digital assistants can provide additional business functionality such integrated data capture via barcode rfid smart card readers by mobile devices often contained sensors such accelerometers compasses magnetometers gyroscopes allowing detection orientation motion mobile devices may provide biometric user authentication such face recognition fingerprint recognition manufacturers include samsung sony htc lg motorola mobility apple contents characteristics types uses see also references sources external links characteristics device mobility can be viewed context several dimensions physical dimensions weight whether not device mobile some kind host which attached mobile what kind host devices can be bound how devices are attached host when mobility occurs strictly speaking many so-called mobile devices are not mobile host that mobile ie mobile human host carries non-mobile smart phone device example true mobile computing device where device itself mobile robot another example autonomous vehicle there are three basic ways mobile devices can be physically bound mobile hosts accompanied surface-mounted embedded into fabric host eg embedded controller embedded host device accompanied refers object being loosely bound accompanying mobile host eg mobile phone can be carried bag pocket but can easily be misplaced hence mobile hosts with embedded devices such autonomous vehicle can appear larger than pocket-sized stated earlier most common size mobile computing device pocket-sized that can be hand-held but other sizes for mobile devices exist too mark weiser known father ubiquitous computing computing everywhere referred device sizes that are tab-sized pad board sized where tabs are defined accompanied wearable centimetre-sized devices eg smartphones smart cards pads are defined hand-held decimetre-sized devices eg laptops tablet computers if one changes form mobile devices terms being non-planar one can also have skin devices tiny dust-sized devices dust refers miniaturised devices without direct hci interfaces eg micro electro-mechanical systems mems ranging from nanometres through micrometers millimetres see also smart dust skin fabrics based upon light emitting conductive polymers organic computer devices these can be formed into more flexible non-planar display surfaces products such clothes curtains see oled display see also smart device although mobility often regarded synonymous with having wireless connectivity these terms are different not all network access by mobile users applications devices need be via wireless networks vice versa wireless access devices can be static mobile users can move between wired wireless hotspots such internet cafés some mobile devices can be used mobile internet devices access internet while moving but they do not need do this many phone functions applications are still operational even while disconnected internet what makes mobile device unique compared other technologies inherent flexibility hardware also software flexible applications include video chat web browsing payment systems nfc audio recording etc mobile devices become ubiquitous there will be proliferation services which include use cloud although common form mobile device smartphone has display another perhaps even more common form smart computing device smart card eg used bank card travel card does not have display this mobile device often has cpu memory but needs connect be inserted into reader order display its internal data state types mobile devices
