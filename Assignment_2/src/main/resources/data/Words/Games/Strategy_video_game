controls game units under their command thus most strategy games involve elements warfare varying degrees feature combination tactical strategic considerations addition combat these games often challenge player's ability explore manage economy relationship other genres even though there are many action games that involve strategic thinking they are seldom classified strategy games strategy game typically larger scope their main emphasis on player's ability outthink their opponent strategy games rarely involve physical challenge tend annoy strategically minded players when they do compared other genres such action adventure games where one player takes on many enemies strategy games usually involve some level symmetry between sides each side generally has access similar resources actions with strengths weaknesses each side being generally balanced although strategy games involve strategic tactical sometimes logistical challenges they are distinct from puzzle games strategy game calls for planning around conflict between players whereas puzzle games call for planning isolation strategy games are also distinct from construction management simulations which include economic challenges without any fighting these games may incorporate some amount conflict but are different from strategy games because they do not emphasize need for direct action upon opponent although strategy games are similar role-playing video games that player must manage units with variety numeric attributes rpgs tend be about smaller number unique characters while strategy games focus on larger numbers fairly similar units game design units conflict strategy games give players indirect control over many units battlefield many games for example globulation include other challenges such building construction conflict strategy games takes place between groups singular combatants usually called units games vary how many types units player can use but each unit has specific strengths weaknesses units vary their movement speed well amount health damage they can withstand units may also have different levels attack strength range although units are typically used for combat they may also be used for other purposes such transport scouting units that cannot move such fixed turrets are often still treated units if unit destroyed player loses benefit that unit most strategy games allow players construct new units buildings factories player commands their forces by selecting unit usually by clicking with mouse issuing order from menu keyboard shortcuts become important for advanced players units can typically move attack stop hold position although other strategy games offer more complex orders units may even have specialized abilities such ability become invisible other units usually balanced with abilities that detect otherwise invisible things some strategy games even offer special leader units that provide bonus other units units may also have ability sail fly over otherwise impassable terrain provide transport for other units non-combat abilities often include ability repair construct other units buildings even imaginary fantastic conflicts strategy games try reproduce important tactical situations throughout history techniques such flanking making diversions cutting supply lines may become integral parts managing combat terrain becomes important part strategy since units may gain lose advantages based on landscape some strategy games such civilization iii medieval total war involve other forms conflict such diplomacy espionage however warfare most common form conflict game designers have found difficult make non-violent forms conflict appealing economy resources upgrades strategy games often involve other economic challenges these can include building construction population maintenance resource management strategy games frequently make use windowed interface manage these complex challenges most strategy games allow players accumulate resources which can be converted units converted buildings such factories that produce more units quantity types resources vary from game game some games will emphasize resource acquisition by scattering large quantities throughout map while other games will put more emphasis on how resources are managed applied by balancing availability resources between players lesser extent some strategy games give players fixed quantity units at start game strategy games often allow player spend resources on upgrades research some these upgrades enhance player's entire economy other upgrades apply unit class units unlock enhance certain combat abilities sometimes enhancements are enabled by building structure that enables more advanced structures games with large number upgrades often feature technology tree which series advancements that players can research unlock new units buildings other capabilities technology trees are quite large some games 4x strategy games are known for having largest build order linear pattern production research resource management aimed at achieving specific specialized goal they are analogous chess openings that player will have specific order play mind however amount build order strategy around which build order built even which build order then used varies on skill ability other factors such how aggressive defensive

manipulate camera games usually feature some kind aerial view very rarely do strategy games show world from perspective from avatar on ground this provide player with big picture view game world form more effective strategies exploration key element most strategy games landscape often shrouded darkness this darkness lifted player's units enters area ability explore may be inhibited by different

times associated with turn-based games praised challenge realism associated with making quick decisions real-time contrast turn-based strategy fans have criticized real-time strategy games because

multiplayer gameplay both single player games will sometimes feature campaign mode which involves series matches against several artificial intelligence opponents finishing each match mission will advance game's plot often with cut scenes some games will reward completed mission with new abilities upgrades hardcore strategy gamers tend prefer multiplayer competition where human opponents provide more challenging competition than artificial intelligence artificial intelligence opponents often need hidden information bonuses provide challenge players more recently massively multiplayer online strategy games have appeared such shattered galaxy from however these games are relatively difficult design implement compared other massively multiplayer online games numerous player-controlled units create larger volume online data by reviewers expressed disappointment with titles produced thus far critics argued that strategy games are not conducive massively multiplayer
