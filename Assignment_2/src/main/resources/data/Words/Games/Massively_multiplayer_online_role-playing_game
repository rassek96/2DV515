massively multiplayer online role-playing games mmorpgs are combination role-playing video games massively multiplayer online games which very large number players interact with one another within virtual world all rpgs player assumes role character often fantasy world science-fiction world takes control over many that character's actions mmorpgs are distinguished from single-player small multi-player online rpgs by number players able interact together by game's persistent world usually hosted by game's publisher which continues exist evolve while player offline away from game mmorpgs are played throughout world worldwide revenues for mmorpgs exceeded half billion dollars western revenues exceeded billion dollars spending on subscription mmorpgs by consumers north american europe grew $14 billion world warcraft popular mmorpg has over million subscribers november world warcraft's total revenue was $104 billion us dollars star wars old republic released became world's

decedents many them share same basic characteristics these include several common features persistent game environment some form level progression social interaction within game in-game culture system architecture membership group character customization themes majority popular mmorpgs are based on traditional fantasy themes often occurring in-game universe comparable that dungeons & dragons some employ hybrid themes that either merge replace fantasy elements with those science fiction sword sorcery crime fiction still others draw thematic material from american comic books occult other genres often these elements are developed using similar tasks scenarios involving quests monsters loot progression nearly all mmorpgs development player's character primary goal nearly all mmorpgs feature character progression system which players earn experience points for their actions use those points reach character levels which makes them better at whatever they do traditionally combat with monsters completing quests for non-player characters either alone groups are primary ways earn experience points accumulation wealth including combat-useful items also way progress many mmorpgs this also traditionally best accomplished via combat cycle produced by these conditions combat leading new items allowing for more combat with no change gameplay sometimes pejoratively referred level treadmill grinding role-playing game progress quest was created parody this trend eve online trains skills real time rather than using experience points measure progression some mmorpgs there no limit player’s level allowing grinding experience continue indefinitely mmorpgs that use this model often glorify top ranked players by displaying their avatars on game’s website posting their stats on high score screen another common practice enforce maximum reachable level for all players often referred level cap once reached definition player’s progression changes instead being awarded primarily with experience for completing quests dungeons player’s motivation continue playing will be replaced with collecting money equipment often widened range equipment available at maximum level will have increased aesthetic value distinguish high ranking players game between lower ranked players colloquially known endgame gear this set empowered weapons armor adds competitive edge both scripted boss encounters well player vs player combat player motivation outperform others fueled by acquiring such items significant determining factor their success failure combat-related situations also traditional genre eventual demand on players team up with others order progress at optimal rate this sometimes forces players change their real-world schedules order keep up with game-world good example this need trade items achieve certain goals teaming up kill powerful enemy traditional social interaction main article social interaction via mmorpgs mmorpgs almost always have tools facilitate communication between players many mmorpgs offer support for in-game guilds clans though these will usually form whether game supports them not addition most mmogs require some degree teamwork parts game these tasks usually require players take on roles group such protecting other players from damage called tanking healing damage done other players damaging enemies mmorpgs generally have game moderators game masters frequently referred gms mods who may be paid employees unpaid volunteers who attempt supervise world some gms may have additional access features information related game that are not available other players roles relationships formed mmorpgs can often be just intense relationships formed between friends partners met outside game often involve elements collaboration trust between players roleplaying most mmorpgs provide different types classes that players can choose among those classes small portion players choose roleplay their characters there are rules that provide functionality content those who do community resources such forums guides exist support this play style for example if player wants play priest role his mmorpg world he might buy cope from shop learn priestly skills proceeding speak act interact with others their character would this may may not include pursuing other goals such wealth experience guilds similar groups with focus on roleplaying may develop extended in-depth narratives using setting resources similar those game world culture over time mmorpg community has developed sub-culture with its own slang metaphor well unwritten list social rules taboos players will often complain about 'grind' slang term for any repetitive time-consuming activity mmorpg talk about 'buffs' 'nerfs' respectively upgrade downgrade particular game mechanic beyond this further sub-cultures exist which can be specific particular games even particular modes within game with all such cultures social rules exist for such things invitations join adventuring party proper division treasure how player expected behave while grouped with other players debate rages various gaming media over long-term effect video game overuse on-line gamers anonymous forums are filled with stories players that have neglected social employment and/or family responsibilities favor their virtual lives system architecture most mmorpgs are deployed using client–server system architecture server software generates persistent instance virtual world that runs continuously players connect via client software client software may provide access entire playing world further 'expansions' may be required be purchased allow access certain areas game everquest guild wars are two examples games that use such format players generally must purchase client software for one-time fee although increasing trend for mmorpgs work using pre-existing thin clients such web browser some mmorpgs require payment monthly subscription play by definition massively multiplayer games are always online most require some sort continuous revenue such monthly subscriptions advertisements for maintenance development purposes some games such guild wars have disposed 'monthly fee' model entirely recover costs directly through sales software associated expansion packs still others adopt micropayment model where core content free but players are given option purchase additional content such equipment aesthetic items pets games that make use this model often have originated korea such flyff maplestory this business model alternately called pay for perks freemium games using often describe themselves with term free-to-play depending on number players system architecture mmorpg might actually be run on multiple separate servers each representing independent world where players from one server cannot interact with those from another world warcraft prominent example with each separate server housing several thousand players many mmorpgs number players one world often limited around few thousand but notable example opposite eve online which accommodates several hundred thousand players on same server with over playing simultaneously june at certain times some games allow characters appear on any world but not simultaneously such seal online evolution others limit each character world which was created world warcraft has experimented with cross-realm ie cross-server interaction player vs player battlegrounds using server clusters battlegroups co-ordinate players looking participate structured player vs player content such warsong gulch alterac valley battlegrounds additionally patch released on december introduced cross-realm looking for group system help players form groups for instanced content though not for open-world questing from larger pool characters than their home server can necessarily provide history mud1 early multi-user game main article history massively multiplayer online role-playing games mmorpg term coined by richard garriott refer massive multiplayer online role-playing games their social communities link between garriott mmorpg term has been recognised by many scholars previous this related coinages these games were generally called graphical muds history mmorpgs traces back directly through mud genre through this connection mmorpgs can be seen have roots earliest multi-user games such mazewar mud1 saw release roguelike pseudo-graphical mud called island kesmai on compuserve lucasfilm's graphical mud habitat first fully graphical multi-user rpg was neverwinter nights which was delivered through america online was personally championed by aol president steve case other early proprietary graphical online rpgs include three on sierra network shadow yserbius fates twinion ruins cawdor another milestone came nsfnet restrictions were lifted opening internet up for game developers which allowed for first truly massively-scoped titles finally mmorpgs defined today began with meridian innovative both its scope offering first-person graphics with realm online appearing nearly simultaneously ultima online released often credited with first popularizing genre though more mainstream attention was garnered by 1999's everquest asheron's call west 1996's nexus kingdom winds south korea financial success these early titles has ensured competition genre since that time mmorpg titles now exist on consoles new settings current market for mmorpgs has blizzard entertainment's world warcraft dominating largest mmorpg alongside other titles such final fantasy xiv guild wars though additional market exists for free-to-play mmorpgs which are supported by advertising purchases in-game items this free-to-play model particularly common south korean mmorpgs such maplestory rohan blood feud atlantica online also there are some free-to-play games such runescape & tibia where game free but one would have pay monthly play game with more features guild wars its successor guild wars avoid some degree competition with other mmorpgs by only requiring initial purchase game play development players interacting argentum online mmorpg cost developing competitive commercial mmorpg title often exceeded $10 million these projects require multiple disciplines within game design development such modeling art animation user interfaces client/server engineering database architecture network infrastructure front-end client component commercial modern mmorpg features graphics with other modern games front-end requires expertise with implementing engines real-time shader techniques physics simulation actual visual content areas creatures characters weapons spaceships so forth developed by artists who typically begin with two-dimensional concept art later convert these concepts into animated scenes models texture maps developing mmog server requires expertise with client/server architecture network protocols security database design mmorpgs include reliable systems for number vital tasks server must be able handle verify large number connections prevent cheating apply changes bug fixes added content game system for recording games data at regular intervals without stopping game also important maintenance requires sufficient servers bandwidth dedicated support staff insufficient resources for maintenance lead lag frustration for players can severely damage reputation game especially at launch care must also be taken ensure that player population remains at acceptable level by adding removing servers peer-to-peer mmorpgs could theoretically work cheaply efficiently regulating server load but practical issues such asymmetrical network bandwidth cpu-hungry rendering engines unreliability individual nodes inherent lack security opening fertile new grounds for cheating can make them difficult proposition hosted infrastructure for commercial-grade mmorpg requires deployment hundreds even thousands servers developing affordable infrastructure for online game requires developers scale large numbers players with less hardware network investment addition development team will need have expertise with fundamentals game design world-building lore game mechanics well what makes games fun non-corporate development screenshot event mmorpg ryzom open source free content game though vast majority mmorpgs are produced by companies many small teams programmers artists have contributed genre shown above average mmorpg development project requires enormous investments time money running game can be long-term commitment result non-corporate independent indie development mmorpgs less common compared other genres still many independent mmorpgs do exist representing wide spectrum genres gameplay types revenue systems some independent mmorpg projects are completely open source while others feature proprietary content made with open-source game engine worldforge project has been active since formed community independent developers who are working on creating framework for number open-source mmorpgs multiverse foundation has also created platform specifically for independent mmog developers trends there are number wildly different titles within genre since genre develops so rapidly difficult definitively state that genre heading one direction another still there are few obvious developments one these developments raid group quest raid which adventure designed for large groups players often twenty more instance dungeons instance dungeons sometimes shortened instances are game areas that are copied for individual players groups which keeps those instance separated from rest game world this reduces competition also reducing amount data that needs be sent from server reducing lag realm online was first mmorpg begin use rudimentary form this technique anarchy online would develop further using instances key element gameplay since then instancing has become increasingly common raids mentioned above often involve instance dungeons examples games which feature instances are world warcraft lord rings online everquest everquest ii aion final fantasy xiv guild wars rift runescape star trek online dc universe online player-created content increased amounts player-created content another trend use licenses use intellectual property licensing common other video game genres has also appeared mmorpgs saw release lord rings online based on j r r tolkien's middle-earth other licensed mmorpgs include matrix online based on matrix trilogy films warhammer online age reckoning based on games workshop's table top game star wars galaxies star wars old republic champions online age conan additionally several licenses from television have been optioned for mmorpgs for example star trek online stargate worlds which was later canceled console-based mmorpgs first console-based mmorpg was phantasy star online for sega dreamcast first console-based open-world mmorpg was final fantasy xi for playstation everquest online adventures also on playstation was first console mmorpg north america although console-based mmorpgs are considered more difficult produce platform gaining more attention browser-based mmorpgs with popularization facebook microtransactions has come new wave flash html5 based mmorpgs that use free play model they require no download outside browser usually have heavily integrated social media sharing features example browser-based mmorpg freewar smartphone-based mmorpgs smartphones with their gps

between mmorpg players are real even if environments are virtual psychologists sociologists are able use mmorpgs tools for academic research sherry turkle clinical psychologist has conducted interviews with computer users including game-players turkle found that many people have expanded their emotional range by exploring many different roles including gender identities that mmorpgs allow person explore nick yee has surveyed more than mmorpg players over past several years focusing on psychological sociological aspects these games recent findings included that 15% players become guild-leader at one time another but most generally find job tough thankless that players spend considerable amount time often third their total time investment doing things that are external gameplay but part metagame many players report that emotions they feel while playing mmorpg are very strong extent that 87% male 232% female players statistical study have had online wedding other researchers have found that enjoyment game directly related social organization game ranging from brief encounters between players highly organized play structured groups study by zaheer hussain mark d griffiths was found that just over one five gamers 21% said they preferred socializing online offline significantly more male gamers than female gamers said that they found easier converse online than offline was also found that 57% gamers had created character opposite gender suggested that online female persona has number positive social attributes german fmrt-study conducted by researchers central institute mental health points towards impairments social emotional physical aspects self-concept higher degree avatar identification addicted mmorpg players compared non-addicted naive nonexperienced people these findings generally support davis' cognitive behavioral model internet addiction which postulates that dysfunctional self-related cognitions represent central factors contributing towards development maintenance mmorpg addiction high degree avatar identification found by leménager et al addicted group this study indicates that mmorpg playing may represent attempt compensate for impairments self-concept psychotherapeutic interventions should therefore focus on development coping strategies for real-life situations which addicted players tend experience themselves incompetent inferior richard bartle author designing virtual worlds classified multiplayer rpg-players into four primary psychological groups his classifications were then expanded upon by erwin andreasen who
