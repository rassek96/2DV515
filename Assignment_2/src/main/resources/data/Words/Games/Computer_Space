early history video games created by nolan bushnell ted dabney partnership syzygy engineering was first arcade video game well first commercially available video game computer space derivative computer game spacewar possibly first video game spread multiple computer installations features rocket controlled by player engaged missile battle with pair flying saucers set against background starfield goal score more hits than enemy spaceships within set time period which awards free round gameplay game enclosed custom fiberglass cabinet one four colors which bushnell designed himself be futuristic game was designed by bushnell dabney during 1970–71 be coin-operated version spacewar after pair were unable find way economically run game on minicomputer such data general nova they hit upon idea instead replacing central computer with custom-designed hardware created just run that game after they built early proof concept founded syzygy engineering bushnell found manufacturer for game nutting associates working partnership with nutting pair ran their first location test august one month prior display similar prototype called galaxy game also based on spacewar after encouraging initial results though mixed responses from distributors nutting ordered initial production run units with anticipation hit game while game was successful validated syzygy's belief future arcade video games selling over cabinets by mid-1972 ultimately 1300–1500 units was not runaway success that nutting had hoped for game spawned one clone game star trek nutting produced two-player version computer space without involvement from syzygy before closing syzygy went on be incorporated atari with their next arcade game successful pong although not influential pong computer space's release marked initial start commercial video game industry contents background gameplay development location tests release reception notes references external links background at beginning 1970s video games existed almost entirely novelties passed around by programmers technicians with access computers primarily at research institutions large companies one these games was spacewar created for digital equipment corporation dec pdp-1 minicomputer by steve russell others programming community at massachusetts institute technology two-player game has players engage dogfight between two spaceships set against backdrop starfield with central star exerting gravitational force upon ships game was copied several early minicomputer installations american academic institutions after its initial release making potentially first video game be available outside single research institute spacewar was extremely popular small programming community 1960s was widely recreated on other minicomputer mainframe computers time later migrating early microcomputer systems early computer scientist alan kay noted that game spacewar blossoms spontaneously wherever there graphics display connected computer contributor martin graetz recalled that game initially spread could be found on just about any research computer that had programmable crt although game was widespread for era was still very limited its direct reach pdp-1 was priced at us$120000 only were ever sold most without monitor which prohibited original spacewar any game time from reaching beyond narrow academic audience original developers spacewar considered ways monetize game but saw no options given high price computer ran on first commercial video game based on spacewar would not be released until computer space gameplay computer space player controls rocket attempts shoot pair flying saucers while avoiding enemy fire monochrome game has three ships flying on two-dimensional plane set against backdrop starfield missiles are fired one at time there cooldown period between launches player's rocket follows newtonian physics remaining motion even when player not accelerating though rocket can rotate at constant rate without inertia flying saucers stay place glide zig-zag pattern around screen tandem with one staying constant distance directly below other if ship missile moves past one edge screen reappears on other side wraparound effect while missile flight player can turn left right instead turning their rocket player controls are clockwise counterclockwise rotation forward thrust firing missiles whenever player hit by missile flying saucer screen flashes player's rocket spins rapidly disappears then reappears same location if flying saucer hit by missile screen flashes saucer briefly disappears counters on right side screen keep count number times player's rocket has been destroyed saucers have been destroyed well how long that round gameplay has lasted round has adjustable time limit seconds with default when time limit reached game ends if player's score lower than computer's if higher black white colors invert hyperspace feature another round begins for free game continues on new rounds with display colors inverting indefinitely if player continues win one round costs quarter two quarters if machine adjusted against instruction manual's recommendations game displays distorted characters if player computer scores pass scores restart at if they reach two-player version game second game mode added featuring two player-controlled rockets fighting each other instead computer-controlled ships modified control panel contains two sets controls with joysticks replacing movement buttons on some machines development single-player computer space cabinet late 1960s nolan bushnell saw spacewar running on mainframe at university utah where he was student bushnell worked during summer at lagoon amusement park utah manager games department overseeing arcade games when he saw spacewar he believed that arcade game version game would be very popular high price computers capable running game however meant that any such arcade game would not be economically feasible after graduating from college bushnell worked engineer california for ampex electronics company that worked audio video recording technology he also met researcher jim stein who worked for stanford university's stanford artificial intelligence project he learned from him that spacewar was running on laboratory's pdp-6 played game against him there when visiting soon after he saw ad for data general nova computer which cost only us$4000 thought again about his spacewar arcade game idea he believed that at that price if he were able connect four monitors coin slots allow multiple games run simultaneously game would be economically viable he showed his office mate fellow ampex engineer ted dabney spacewar at stanford laboratory two agreed work together try design prototype game bushnell was more experienced with computers digital engineering while dabney was more experienced with analog hardware engineering he had been working on designing video processing control circuits power supplies after agreeing on initial idea bushnell dabney began trying design prototype based on data general nova initially they were joined by larry bryan computer programmer who also worked at ampex bushnell dabney put us$100 each into partnership named syzygy by bryan they soon ran into difficulties with their planned design computer was not powerful enough refresh monitors fast was needed make game playable bryan realized this early on when trying design code needed run games left project before syzygy was formed without ever contributing any money but bushnell dabney continued working on design for several more months pair attempted reduce load on computer by replacing subroutines—such displaying background stars—with specialized hardware but proved insufficient even reducing number monitors was not enough by end november bushnell decided abandon project untenable while dabney had stopped working on design while before unclear if pair were aware that data general had demonstrated more powerful variant nova sold for us$8000 running single game spacewar at fall joint computer conference december though that solution would have been too expensive for arcade game which typically cost us$1000 at time unable put game idea out his mind however bushnell soon thought way manipulate video signal on screen without computer controlling from there syzygy came up with idea removing computer altogether building specialized hardware handle everything for game instead bushnell dabney began design custom hardware run game's functions they soon discovered that cost build whole game's computing systems would be much lower result they would not need have multiple instances game running on same machine order be profitable on other hand however custom hardware was not powerful more expensive nova computer which meant that pair needed make gameplay modifications spacewar was two-player game featuring dogfights around gravitational field central star neither these features could be run on dedicated circuits pair were making so game was cut down single-player game wherein player would fight against two computer-controlled spaceships open space by january pair had built some basic hardware which could connect monitor with plans continue expanding make game now named cosmic combat but they were still far away from turning what was then dot moving on screen into full spacewar-like game cabinet january bushnell dabney founded syzygy engineering official company now with cash amount us$350 they approached ampex prior manager dabney's with their prototype but found no interest major arcade game manufacturers were based out chicago at time limiting their ability demonstrate their idea existing firm during dentist appointment early bushnell told dentist about game that he was looking for manufacturer dentist turn referred him another patient his dave ralstin sales manager for nutting associates mountain view california nutting had been founded on basis computer quiz analog quiz arcade game by was looking for another hit game after meeting with bushnell nutting felt that his game was potential success they needed replace falling sales computer quiz updates they had not had hit game since nutting not only agreed manufacture game but also hired bushnell their chief engineer they had no real engineering team at time furthermore syzygy engineering retained ownership game even though nutting agreed give syzygy space build prototype manufacture game once complete syzygy would be paid five percent each cabinet sold bushnell negotiated work on cosmic combat outside normal working hours until went into production order keep conceptually separate from his new job at nutting so prevent nutting from later claiming ownership due paying for time materials spent building game dabney remained at ampex until summer when he resigned join bushnell at nutting he was initially unwilling leave stable job he'd worked at for ten years without more proof that game could be success location tests release computer space control panel once he moved nutting bushnell took over majority engineering work for game dabney has stated that he advised bushnell on some design that some construction was done by steve bristow intern at ampex there disagreement interviews with bushnell dabney how much work dabney did on final cabinet with dabney claiming credit for controls sound power supply initial wooden cabinet invention hyperspace color inversion while bushnell claims credit for everything but sound cabinet power supply monitor by august initial prototype game—now named computer space be similar computer quiz—was complete syzygy moved on location testing they installed game at dutch goose bar near stanford university where met with great success nutting was heartened by response rushed make several finished cabinets for music operators america moa music & amusement machines exposition october further location tests found less enthusiastic response from customers confused by game mechanics controls syzygy hurriedly tried adjust game be more understandable players final computer space design uses no microprocessor memory entire computer system state machine made 74-series ttl chips with graphic elements held diode arrays array designs which bushnell designed let him rotate rocket directions with only arrays are laid out shape ships which made obvious game operators what would need be replaced if something broke ships themselves are projected on screen pattern dots rather than connected lines monitor they are projected on general electric 15-inch black white television screen specially modified for game rudimentary artificial intelligence constructed by bushnell has enemy ships firing towards quadrant screen that player's rocket rather than more complicated tracking algorithm syzygy nutting prepared for moa show bushnell learned that another pair engineers were also creating arcade version spacewar august bushnell called bill pitts hugh tuck operating computer recreations so that they could meet discuss their solutions problem running spacewar on inexpensive computer pitts tuck were almost finished with prototype machine galaxy game when they met with bushnell game however while faithful recreation spacewar ran on externally-connected dec pdp-11 with hewlett-packard 1300a electrostatic display total cost prototype unit was us$20000 syzygy duo were relieved though also somewhat disappointed find that galaxy game was not using innovative solution syzygy had missed build economically-competitive arcade game pitts tuck conversely felt that computer space was pale imitation spacewar while galaxy game was superior adaptation game they eventually produced two game prototypes both displayed stanford student union building but never produced game commercially due high cost cabinet computer space debuted at moa show on october 15–17 dabney's wooden cabinet for initial prototype was replaced with curvy futuristic fiberglass cabinet designed by bushnell with modelling clay built by swimming pool manufacturer control panel extended from main body cabinet contained four control buttons syzygy had hoped use joystick control rocket's movement but found that broke too easily failing last single night location test galaxy game designers had run into same issue but had solved with expensive customized military surplus joysticks cabinet displayed nutting associates name logo along with term syzygy engineered nutting displayed four cabinets at moa show one each red blue white yellow with implication that game was already production though they were fact only four cabinets then produced these initial cabinets were solid colors though later ones would use sparkle finish cabinets were damaged during transport one monitor was broken syzygy repaired three working cabinets opened up fourth demonstrate internals attendees game distributors were hesitant about game with concerns raised about game's potential reliability embedded monitor's attractiveness thieves recollections are mixed whether nutting took handful no orders at show nutting however ordered large production run regardless on expectation that distributors would come around with further exposure game was displayed again at international association amusement parks attractions show from november 9–12 then entered production later that month reception 2-player computer space cabinet with buttons instead joysticks nutting ordered initial production run units computer space optimistic decision given that hit arcade game at time would sell around units though handful had reached reception game from distributors was mixed while some were excited by game others felt be confusing part passing video game fad by spring game had sold over units according bushnell ended up selling between units while this was commercial success making over us$1000000 was disappointment nutting who had been hoping for large-scale success like computer quiz game's relative lack success was attributed complexity its controls steep learning curve which pushed away customers used less complex games bushnell noted that locations that game did well like dutch goose playtest location were generally located near university campuses general market for coin-operated games however was working-class bars where patrons were less interested deciphering complicated game documentary video game invasion history global obsession bushnell explained sure i loved all my friends loved but all my friends were engineers was little too complicated for guy with beer bar bushnell has also stated that part difficulty lay novelty game he has said that even few years later controls gameplay would have been more understandable players who would have seen other video games by then conversely bushnell dabney have said that game's novelty was also part its appeal players—most people had never seen television screen displaying images being controlled by person front rather than playing video from remote television station while game did not meet high hopes nutting was successful enough that nutting produced two-player version game july with green fiberglass cabinet built by steve bristow design was initially contracted bushnell but was either uncompleted unused game had no further involvement from bushnell dabney was not large success additionally although biggest successes arcade games at time generally spawned dozen copycat games computer space had only single clone produced by for-play manufacturers star trek game its cabinet bore little resemblance television show itself custom white computer space cabinet appeared film soylent green futuristic entertainment device marking first appearance video game movie by may bushnell dabney quit nutting associates moved incorporate syzygy engineering they instead named atari due another company with similar name bushnell later stated that he was encouraged by success computer space regards future game ideas he had never before created something that made so much money additionally felt that his time at nutting gave him confidence running his own company because he couldn't screw up more than they did nutting associates did not make any further computer space games before closing bushnell's enthusiasm was soon substantiated atari's first game pong went on substantially greater success than computer space although not influential pong computer space's release marked beginning commercial video game industry notes unclear exactly when bushnell first saw spacewar he has claimed have seen at university utah while student on mainframe computer—the specific one not consistent between stories—but he graduated no computer capable running was available at that university anyone besides university researchers before ted dabney has claimed that bushnell did not see spacewar until at stanford unclear what extent each pair were responsible for early hardware for game both dabney bushnell claim credit for much contradict each other interviews they both agree that idea for hardware-based video modulator was bushnell's but dabney claims that he designed constructed his daughter's bedroom-turned-office stand-alone project while bushnell claims that he did majority design digital engineering work on hardware was still pursuing connecting nova computer until late january when another engineer proved him that nova still could not run game b graetz j m august origin spacewar creative computing 56–67 issn 0097-8140 b c
